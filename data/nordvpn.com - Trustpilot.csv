Here's what happened, I purchased a subscription for my mom who lives in Iran so that she can connect to the Internet (due to regime restricting the network). She tried it but it didn't work, so I had to buy another VPN that works. I then tried to contact Nord to cancel my subscription as they deliberately not allow the users to cancel it on their own. I attempted contacting their support through the chatbot many times withing the two weeks leading to my 30 day trial. Every time I tried it would show me a message to wait until they connect me to a live agent. 5-10-15 minutes later, I would get an error message that I am disconnected and I should try again. I went through this cycle almost every other day. Fast forward it to a day after my trial ends, and suddenly I get connected! Only to be denied cancellation, because it was ""past the 30 day trial"". Regardless of the screenshots I provided from the chatbox, they denied refunding me. Now I have to live with 2 years of subscription I will never use. ID #12134681",CA

163,nordvpn.com,2022-12-19T15:13:57.000Z,1,Dreadful customer service experience…,"Dreadful customer service experience and a friction full method to confirming account holder identification.  Their app begged me to turn on 2 factor authentication every time I logged in. I got sick of seeing it so I applied it using Google Authenticator. When I swapped phones I didn’t know I needed to transfer authentication codes. So I lost my login method.  I asked for NordVPN customer services to turn off my 2FA so I can gain access again to my account that has a 2 year paid subscription on it. And in order to do this they want me to provide the full 16 digit card number I paid on. Which I no longer have as it’s a credit card account I closed last year. So in order to get this information I would have to go and ask my previous credit provider for it. NOT TO MENTION ASKING CUSTOMERS TO SEND FINANCIAL DETAILS LIKE LONG CARD NUMBERS OVER EMAIL IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND SHOWS THAT CUSTOMER PRIVACY MEANS LITTLE TO NORD.  THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE MY PAYMENT CARD DETAILS ON FILE TO VERIFY MY IDENTITY WITH, SUGGESTS YOU MAYBE OPERATING IN VIOLATION OF UK AND EU PAYMENT LAWS. THAT PAYMENT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SENT TO NORD AS AN ENCRYPTED TRANSACTION. So instead I say you know what, fine delete my account instead then please Nord. Oh and the answer is the same. It’s not my fault you don’t ask customers to setup security questions when signing up. I’ve provided you already with a receipt and the last 4 digits of the card and I’m emailing you from the account holder email address. There’s not much more I can do. It’s your product manager who failed to put in better verification mechanisms not the customers. Once I’m done fighting you via the UK Information Commissioner Office to delete my data. I will take my business elsewhere. You have a good product but terrible, terrible support.",GB
164,nordvpn.com,2022-12-15T16:40:43.000Z,3,Room for Improvement,"Update 2022/12/15: Nordvpn refunded me the last recurring payment as promised. I changed the review to 3 stars. The team on social media is a lot better than the ones on the live chat.  Review on 2022/12/11: I had never used NordVPN before, and I thought I gave it try because ExpressVPN no longer supports Mac systems anymore. I purchased the 30-day money-back guarantee monthly package, but I did not know that this VPN does not work in China despite trying different connections. I could not contact them in China because all VPN websites are banned there. So I contacted NordVPN customer service after I came back. I thought a big company like NordVPN would treasure their customer experience and will compensate their customers when issues arise. To my surprise, NordVPN DID NOT CARE AT ALL. All this company cares about is its own profit.  Customer service agents are trained not to give a refund regardless of whether there are issues with them or not. They will keep repeating the same message and refuse to refund. Also, no ticket number, no transcript sent to email. And what's more, I found that my earlier conversation started to disappear, and I could not record the whole conversation.  I don't see any attitude of them trying to fix any problems, improve, or care about their customers. What I see is they are cheating customers, not offering what they promise but charging them anyways.  Please BE AWARE of this company. This is almost a true scam for a company this size. I just want to say a company that does not treasure its customer experience should not be treasured by its customers.",US

Now this brilliant company doesn’t “know” how to refund my money (paid on their website with cc), and also to remove my data/account have to provide everything what’s already in my account!

The payment method you have used. 2. The exact date of the payment. 3. The exact payment amount.

This is 100% fraud. When you try to claim anything. A bot refer you to a known scam company Paddle.net. My antivirus program warned me ten times to even visit this page. Ones you get there there is a bot chat. And there you can answer “donald duck” on all questions, it leads to the same response in the end anyway. You wont get any money. They say write a mail to a mail address and that bot will say your claim is under dispute. But in the end you will not get your money back however many mails you write. NordVPN you now have worse customer care than apple them self. I did not think that was possible but you have them beat. Congrats! Reply to reply :1 And the lies continues, I specifically asked for my money back in regards to the 30 day back guarantee You so proudly advertise on you r page.   And ""out of our hands"" Just what is that supposed to mean. (lie two btw). What sad way to treat a customer. So now it is 2022-12-06. The latest in this case is that Paddle.net said they could not refund me as Paypal had closed the case. So I call Paypal and they explain that it is closed due to it is not them that should refund me which is totally  true. And the nice lady att Paypal really felt with me and all of us that have been scammed by Nord VPN via paddle.net.   And further more she said they can pay you back any time they want. If they decide to do so.  So it is a riddel why paddle.net would blame it on Paypal. they have nothing to do with my claim towards NordVPN. just another lame excuse I guess. Update 2022-12-10 After doing everything I can the guy that runs NordVPN's instagram had enough and started talking like a human to me not just copy pasting semi bot text.  He understood that he will never get rid of me and I will mess up more for him than what they are scamming me for. So he refereed me to a nother guy that first started with the semi bot copy paste texts. But I told him to lay that down as Paypal do not appreciate being thrown under the bridge by them.  Then he turned out to be a person who could talk too! what do you know! hey. He wrote to Paddle.net and said it will take one to three days to get a reply.  So lets see what they have for me on Tuesday or lets give them until wednesday day. stay tuned.",SE

Nowhere on the NordVPN do they actually tell you that they price only in US dollars (despite not being a US-based company) and that they are unable to show prices in Canadian dollars. Apparently, NordVPN only has the limited ability to show prices in US dollars, Euros, UK pounds, Brazilian reals, Japanese yen, Indian rupees, Swiss francs, Polish zloty, or South Korean won. Even though Canada has a population greater than either Switzerland or Poland, NordVPN cannot figure out how to include Canadian dollars as a currency option for displaying prices. I had looked at a 2-year standard plan on the NordVPN site, and it stated that the price was ""$80.73"". The next line item on the pricing said ""Tax country: Canada"" and ""GST/HST 13%"" with a value of ""$10.49"". The total amount was shown ""$91.22"". Given that they identified that I reside in Canada and incorporated the appropriate Canadian sales tax, this gives the impression that all $ prices shown on the site are in Canadian dollars. On the left hand side of the page, for credit card payment it indicated that ""Payments are charged in CAD"", which appears to confirm that the amount of $91.22 is a Canadian dollar amount that will be charged to my credit card in CAD. There were no disclaimers, no footnotes and no terms & conditions that indicated that the $91.22 was actually in US dollars, not in Canadian dollars. When I completed the purchase, my credit card was actually charged $123.97! When I contacted NordVPN support about this discrepancy in the amount I was shown and the amount I was charged, they told me that I should know that ""$91.22"" is US dollars, because they believe that ""$"" symbol only references US dollars (even though they do not disclose this assumption anywhere on their website). The customer service representative from NordVPN then told me that in Canada, prices do not use the ""$"" symbol, that instead ""CA$"" is what is used for Canadian dollars in Canada. Obviously NordVPN has no idea that in Canada we list prices using ""$"" to reference our Canadian dollars, and we do NOT use ""CA$"". If you shop in stores in Canada or on any Canadian website, the ""$"" symbol is used to denote Canadian dollars. I have since asked for a full refund from NordVPN, because their practice of showing ""$"" prices to Canadians without disclosing that the amount is actually in US dollars is misleading, dishonest, and possibly an intentional bait & switch by NordVPN to overcharge Canadians, hoping that we do not notice that a higher amount gets charged after the payment is processed. All Canadians need to be warned that any pricing you see on NordVPN is only in US dollars. NordVPN fails to disclose this, so be forewarned!",CA

Finally I was connected to someone called Llyod who after spending an hour kept insisting that he is able to resolve it, and reminding that he can't help (which is frustrating as well).

I was told that there was a technical issue and that I would be sent a ticket number and receive a reply within 1-3 days. I simply want my refund. If the billing system shut down for a millisecond I guarantee it would be fixed in a millisecond. Very disappointed with the response and service delivered by NordVPN. Update 16/11/22: After I posted my statement here on Trustpilot the technical issue preventing the repayment process was instantly fixed. I remain very cynical about NordVPNs commitment to a smooth refund within the 30 day window. There is no tab to click and you have to go through chat line and endure the excuses I had to listen to to beg for a refund. Beware about signing up for the 30 day trials. I will now keep my fingers crossed the refund is processed quickly into my bank account. Update 18/11/22: Refund received.,GB

It always wants to connect to Mexico - I bought the service so I can appear to be in the US! It will not allow me to choose ""United States"" as a permanent log-on option (IT IS THE ONLY OPTION I WANT) but always chooses a Mexican IP and even after being manually corrected over and over and over, consistently drops the US server to reconnect to Mexico. If you keep clicking the US option it often stalls for 10+ minutes! Then Nord tells me, I'm offline. Yeah. That's why I'm shopping on one website & listening to YouTube on another. I have excellent, high quality internet that only drops infrequently. I paid for Nord, it sucks, I hate it and I'm stuck with it for a long long time.  2 stars because if I fight with it, don't give up, keep clicking that button and work at it, I can get on US-only websites for entertainment, and Walmart & Amazon - for a while.  Truly, this is so frustrating that sometimes I feel like I'll have a stroke in anger. I do hope I'm a little bit telekinetic & cause someone at Nord to drop dead instead.

On reading different pages on their website I found conflicting and misleading information, but every time I pointed this out, the customer service agent just went back to their conditions of service and repeated that they were entitled to take premiums 2 weeks early.

This ended up locking me out of critical systems that depended on this IP. I contacted Nord support when the IP stopped working (not realising I had already paid) and they told me to open a new Nord account under a separate email. Only later when doing my bookkeeping did I notice the payment for this service leaving my account in September, but at this point I had moved to another provider. I contacted Nord for a refund and they refused me based on the fact that 30 days had lapsed. This is despite me contacting them and getting incorrect advice (to pay again) back in October. Nord offered me another 9 months for free (why if not an admission of wrong doing?), I declined and they refuse to return my money. I've used Nord for years and have 10 members of staff that I've encouraged to use Nord in the past. They've totally lost my trust. EDIT 10th Nov 2022 - Support put this right in the end.

638,nordvpn.com,2022-10-31T00:54:00.000Z,1,Not recommended for servers in Argentina,"I should start saying that NordVPN does not deliver what they promise.  First of all, if NordVPN read all my support chats since I contracted the service they will see I’ve been having the same recurrent issue which none of their customer service agents were able to solve - and this even includes a manager. My frustration over the past few days has been building up. I went through troubleshooting over and over again - I can even confirm that the first step is to run a DNS leak test which I have completed several times in a successful manner.  The key issue here does not seem to be configuration related and hence why agents cannot seem to help out. I have been advised that the servers in the country I wanted to connect to (Argentina) get “overloaded”, preventing users to use them correctly and causing ridiculously slow speeds. I ran several speed test which all came back at a download speed of 1mbps whilst without a VPN on my regular speed is 70mbps I have also been given some other arguments such as servers in country I wanted to connect to were too far away from my actual location (London) and hence why low speeds. When the issue is not speed, it’s related to Netflix detecting I am using a proxy and therefore not letting me stream any content. Reality is I do not care whatever the reason is. I contracted NordVPN because I wanted to access content from Argentina and and all I know is that the service/product is not fit for purpose. If I need to take a step further, customer service provided by the company is just poor. It is surprisingly quick to reach/speak to the support team. However, I think good customer service is about quality and not quantity/access speed to it.  The responses/troubleshooting I was given can be found on the website and they only follow these 101 steps. However, if things do get more technical then they need to create a ticket and raise it with the actual “engineers”, which obviously takes time to hear back. Also, I was provided troubleshooting steps as setting manual DNS address on my network configuration in windows whilst I had repetitively explained to the agent that I was using OPENVPN config on my ASUS router as I wanted all my devices to be connected to a VPN. Therefore, this simply shows signs that agents do not read carefully to customer needs. In addition to this, there’s no contact phone number. Support is only provided via chat which makes things also a bit impersonal and frustrating as sometimes a phone call can be much quicker than having an endless chat - I believe we all experience this, even at work when colleagues use teams rather than grabbing the phone and discuss something in literally 5 minutes. For all these reasons I just mentioned, I do believe NordVPN is far away from a good business. In fact, I do not think the business has a long term reason to exist, which is actually concerning for stakeholders of this business. Market is quite competitive and NordVPN definitely does not achieve good standards in terms of reliability which is key for companies of this type.",GB

788,nordvpn.com,2022-10-24T23:44:33.000Z,1,NordVPN is the worst,"Occured before and around 02/24/22. About a month after the 30 day refund window NordVPN started to consistently drop a secure connection (exposing me while I'm away at work) and eventually couldn't connect at all. I contacted support still interested in making it work and did everything they suggested. It still didn't work. I deleted Nord entirely off my computer and re-downloaded it at least 9 times. I restarted my computer, checked that it was functioning properly, upgraded drivers, ran all sorts of scans. Nothing worked, so I contacted them again and explained nothing you have suggested has worked and I'm sick of this so I'd like a refund, please. The customer service creeps I had to deal with were totally unapologetic and insisted they would never give me a refund because I was past the 30 day window and that I just needed to do MORE FREE WORK TO FIX THEIR SERVICE! I pointed out the problems only occurred conveniently about one month after that window closed and I was not interested in doing free work to fix their garbage. Terrible, and I'm not the only one. There are multiple posts on review websites about similar garbage service and push back from Nord. Some lucky people only got a refund after they complained on Twitter. I hate Twitter and will never use it so this wasn't an option for me. Nord is a terrible VPN. Even years prior, while it usually worked consistently it would for no reason at all drop a connection and fail to auto connect afterwards. The worst part about all this is the ultra cringe-y way they will do everything they can to avoid refunding a measly $60 bucks and fail to acknowledge them ripping you off. I paid for a service that stopped working and that's my problem. I paid for nothing. I understand charge-backs look bad for a company but if you keep the money after your service fails your just scamming people. Stay away from NordVPN. Terrible company, terrible service. To Nord, sorry it took me so long to post these reviews. I got so angry I couldn't think straight and decided to cool off only to forget the need to inform others. Also, they and the people they sponsor on Youtube for example are blatantly lying about using Nord for watching Netflix and Hulu. Both services rapidly stop working if you use a VPN. You can connect at first and watch stuff from other countries for about 30 minutes then they stop playing and bring up an error message that your using a VPN! WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE! I don't blame Nord for this but they need to stop blatantly lying about it being one of the perks of a VPN. It never worked for more than one episode. I always had to disconnect from Nord to watch things on either. In conclusion: I paid for a service to set it and forget it. Not work out bugs for free. Some of the worst business practice and customer service I've ever encountered. I feel totally ripped off. Terrible waste of time.",US

There has never been a time where I've found the experience of contacting Nord's help team to be anything other than diligent, courteous, and dedicated to problem-solving to the best of their abilities. I should make a special note of the assistance supplied by a really excellent member of the connectibility team, Jackson, who not only answered questions about a particularly complicated and delicate issue that has arisen for me, telling me what I needed to know honestly and concisely, but who also went above and beyond to walk through the nature of the issue and to creatively troubleshoot it with me, in spite of it taking some time to do so.

For that I would have rated the service as a 3.5/5. However, I opted to let my service expire and purchased VPN services from a competitor (SurfShark) this past March. I discovered 6 months later that NordVPN had charged my credit card for another year anyway. Unfortunately it was a card I no longer use and do not receive print statements for so this went unnoticed for 6 months and resulted in interest charges etc.. When I requested a refund from Nord, they refused. I pointed out that I had not authorized the charge and had not used their services since my previous service period lapsed, they refused to refund me anyway. I would give then a 1/5 for that but in balance my overall rating is a 2/5.",CA

905,nordvpn.com,2022-10-20T12:32:22.000Z,1,Their vpn is 100% garbage,"Their vpn is 100% garbage. Their web app version doesn't work-won't let you even log in. The chromebook extension works for to block ""some sites"" BUT it no longer works to block Youtubetv so that a paying customer can watch it outside of the US. I recently started a subscription w/youtubetv and, again, it doesn't work-EVEN though they advertise falsely that their vpn works best w/Youtubetv. Their customer service is beyond atrocious and actually hostile-and they expect you to do the troubleshooting for them! I had purchased a 2 year plan ($94) a year before I got the Youtubetv paid monthy subscription and they REFUSED to refund a measle $47 back to me. They are based in Panama City in order to skirt US laws and regulation, naturally. They are petty and cheap. I had to switch to their big rival, ExpressVPN and it works w/Youtubetv.  UPDATE: So their almost IMMEDIATE response to my posted review proves my point. They are worried about what their customers are posting out there online about them these days. It's clear they have an automated way to see new reviews on this site every day. Hilarious. So now they want the ticket #? For what? They have provided zero customer service/support and have refused to refund my 2nd year of my subscription. So now they will refund me? I highly doubt that-it would just be another waste of my time-I asked to support to escalate my ticket to management for refund and all they was continually make excuses and refuse to do so.

After a few back and forths with them they insisted that my account was good thru November 2023 even tho it was not reflected on their site. I took them at their word. On Oct.13 I received an email saying I would be charged in 30 days to extend my experiencing account.

I've never had an issue with connecting or slow speeds etc. Even the Firefox browser extension is pretty decent.  I just came across my first issue now. It said I was using the max 6 devices and need to disconnect one to connect.... I found out some weird email ""callcenteragent423@gmail"" was connected to my account for God knows how long. So I disconnected it and finally enabled 2fa.  Contacted live support to ask about the service credital username and password since I couldn't see where tovchange it... Figure the email attached to my account was some kind of bot net and likely using it on a router anyways. I spoke with ""Jordan"" and they were great. Usually, livechat agents (no matter how rich the comany) will know nothing about the site/service and just copy paste from a transcript and be of no help. But Jordan said he wasn't to sure, so he would look into it. Only took him about 45 seconds and he told me it will automatically change once I create a new account password....   Which he had already told me to do from the start (:  Normally I'd rate 4/5 max but what gets the extra 25% here is how human Jordan spoke. Didn't paste anything from a script, seems like hes fluent in English  which is a MAJOR plus for support agents. It's so frusturing having to use live support anyone online usually.

What is absolutely appaling is their customer service. They renewed my contract this year and then I was unable to login with certain computers as they keep making you change your password whether you want to or not. I tried to use their website to reset my password but their Forgot Your Password wasn't sending me a reset email as THEY were having a problem with my registered email's domain although I was getting emails from them at that address. I then went through days that went into weeks trying to get this sorted but they said the ONLY way of doing this was to let them know what the payment date and method were. I couldn't find this and they wouldn't give me even the date of payment as they are a security firm that are apparently more secure than CIA in handing over critical info such as what date was the payment made. I asked all 4 of the customer ""support"" people what name they debited it in and all 4 insisted it was NordVpn.com. FINALLY after my bookeeper looked through 3 bank accounts, 7 credit cards, Paypal and direct bank payments we found it under MOONFLASH LTD with no mention of NORDVPN!! Total incompetence or what!  I have now sent them this information and 3 further emails and they are ghosting me as they must be too embaressed to admit how incompetent they are! UPDATED- 13 OCT 22 After receiving their reply below saying they are still looking into this I tried logging in then the Forgot Password link,  I did get  the password reset email and so reset my password. I then could get into my account last night but guess what, today I'm locked out AGAIN for ""Security Reasons""?? Can they be any more useless going further! My guess is yes but let's see!",GB

Only website I was having an issue with while using NordVPN. I was connected with Kyra and they were able to help me go through some troubleshooting steps I had not tried out yet and it turns out that all I needed to do was set the default VPN protocol to TCP instead of Auto and this cleared up my issue instantly. This makes sense as UDP is for speed and the sender does not care if the packets get received properly or not. TCP is stable as the received lets the sender know the packets were received successfully.,US

Could connect to the hot spot but got no internet. Tried a bunch of tips from Google over two days with no luck. Uninstalled Nord and was able to connect to the internet but I wanted a VPN as I am travelling abroad and I had heard such good things that I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. I'm sure glad I did. Connected with Bethany from Customer Services over Nord chat after emailing Nord about the issue. Bethany was very patient when I kept accidentally logging in and out of the chat, she was able to talk me through diagnosing the issue and she was able to help me fix it.  I now know what obfuscated servers are lol.  The good things I've heard about Nord were true - great customer service, speedy responses and good knowledge of their products and how to fix issues. Highly recommend!",TH

I contacted my card company, twice, both times they couldn't even see the transaction. So clearly it hadn't been processed at the Nord end. Next I was told by Nord to try a different card! I gave up.

After receiving confirmation for a 3 year subscription (I have the email and receipt to prove it), my service got canceled after 1 year and they are asking me to pay for another year. After many back and forth communications with their ""Customer Success Team"" (ticket #11679791), they refuse to re-establish my subscription and admit their mistake despite me having proof on paper that they renewed me for 3 years! On top of that, they have the gall to offer me a 2 year plan at a discount instead of honoring our agreement! I am hugely disappointed in NordVpn as I was previously satisfied with their services but this blunder totally disillusioned me. I don't even know if they care but they just lost a customer. UPDATE - Since I have written on Trustpilot, Nord VPN has finally admitted their fault and restored my service. Although I am grateful, it shouldn't have been so difficult to do so. Proof of purchase with the exact 3-year period shown should have been enough for them to reestablish my service without the back and forth for about a week.",CA

I used to be able to select a specific server I previously used, such as Singapore #377. In the new update, they removed this feature, and so if a previous server worked consistently for me, I used to be able to use the same specific server again, but now I can't do this. As of writing, NordVPN has not worked for me for the past 3 days straight, which was the tipping point for this review. I would love if Nord would bring back the ability to chose a specific server so that my issues can be dramatically alleviated.",US

1280,nordvpn.com,2022-10-04T14:18:14.000Z,5,NordPass login issues patiently resolved,"Tuesday 4 Oct 2022. The problem started when I couldn't log into my NordPass app that I had just installed on my new device. The old device that I set NordPass Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) on was damaged and was no longer in use. The NordPass App kept asking me to type the MFA Code displayed on my Authenticator App! But I couldn't do that because the I had just installed the Authenticator App on my new device, and it too kept asking me to scan the QR Code that I received from the Nord in order for me to proceed! What? I set up my NordVPN and NordPass in 2019! How should I remember where the QR Code or Backup Codes are, (if I even had any in the first place)? In the end, out of frustration, I contacted Nord Customer Support via the online chat function. I’m not great when it comes to typing on keyboards. I type really slowly. And so, I just want to give a shout out to Norman from Nord Customer Support for his long-suffering patience today, while he helped me reset my NordPass MFA. He didn’t rush me even though I was taking quite a long time to type my responses. He patiently let me answer all the questions he asked me. I even got worried a bit when he asked me for the first 6 digits of my Credit Card Number, the expiry date, and the amount that I paid for my Nord package. I even mentioned this to him that this was a lot of personal details he was asking me to give out. But he calmly reassured me that this was only for security purposes in order to verify that I was the actual Nord account owner before he could deactivate MFA for me. Fair enough. In the end, after about 10 minutes of patiently bearing with me, the personal information I gave checked out, and Norman finally deactivated my MFA. I can happily say I can now log into my NordPass. And yes, I will be very careful to save the Backup Codes when I re-activate MFA this time around. Overall, great Customer Service from Nord.",GB

As a Canadian, paying anything in USD is really expensive. And initially buying the NordVPN service 2 years ago on a special I completely forgot I was being charged in USD. About to start my 3rd year, the renewal email is only sent once and its 30 days in advance, so naturally I forgot all about it but it tells you that you'll be charged whatever amount (in my case at time of writing $99.48 for 1 year). It didn't mention currency and so it didn't even occur to me that it could be in USD...(netflix, disney, amazon, other services is in CAD so easy to forget)...well today I was charged the amount but it came out to 150$ CAD! that's crazy expensive for 1 year of service. In comes customer service superstar LENNIE. Mind you, same day I got charged is the same day I asked for a refund. The refund option was on the table, but Lennie also offered me a deal where I get additional months added to my subscription at no extra charge (on top of the 150 I already paid). The amount of months I got made it SO worth it. It works out to the point where if I broke it down into per month cost I would forget I'm even paying for a VPN service.  I consider myself sort of a power user of NordVPN. Its setup on my home router, on my laptop and my cell phone. That alone should tell you how much I use it, its an important part of my online experience. So thank you, Lennie, so much for giving me a great opportunity to continue subscribing to NordVPN instead of issuing the refund immediately where I would then go somewhere else and find a different VPN service. tldr; signed up 2 years ago, renewal was today, paid 150$ CAD for 1 year sub, too expensive, refund was an option but Lennie gave me a deal for extra months no additional charge. Was a sweet deal so I took it.",CA

I set my account to NOT auto-renew, just after setting the account up. This setting was reversed, by Nord, some time after. I was hours away from them debiting my bank, recently, when I stopped the process.  Others were not so lucky, I am annoyed that Nord support insist that myself and others are effectively lying, about turning off the auto-renew and also that they have always sent out confirmation EMails, when you cancel. Nord do not deserve my money, so they will not get any more. ------------ following a reply: To N.L. (of Nord) You obviously did not read what I wrote.

Spent hours trying to fix it, similar to other times before. On other occasions it has said ""limited"" or connections problems. But I now understand why... it is your stupid software. I have had numerous connection problems and hours of repeated disruption to my internet connection because of your software over the years, so I have uninstalled it and may request a refund. I have not had the same problems with pureVPN and other providers with better software interface and features. With my problem today, other customers in microsoft forums and on reddit recommend uninstalling Nord vpn. For me this INSTANTLY fixed the problem and all browsers and apps work - which your software offers no features before login/startup (which obviously fails cos ""no internet"") to prevent. This is truly dumb software if all diagnostics on windows will point to a firewall or other issue preventing a connection when it is YOUR software - this type of issue should have been fixed long ago. Avoid! Edit/addition: To respond to Nord - no it was not a kill switch issue. Nice try to deflect rather than address the issue. Seems that is your company's culture.",NZ

The bad is that they default the auto renew and they renewed us, without notification of the price change, at $99.  Of course their customer service would not do anything about this.  I find this very unethical and therefor would not personally use their product(s) in the future.  Look at all their negative reviews.  This company has corrupt business practices.  This isn't the first time they have ripped off their customer.  Be careful of using any credit card with them. This is the canned response you will get from them:  Please note that we have drastically improved our service, added new features, thus our user base has grown several times. That being said, it is only natural that we had to review and modify our current pricing to maintain the quality of our service and to continue growing.  The issue is that they are unethically changing their price without your knowledge. With their logic you could end up with a $200, $300.. bill and no recourse.",US

1516,nordvpn.com,2022-09-26T19:10:21.000Z,1,Cancellation confirmation never sent,"I was recently disappointed, by the response from the Nord support team.   After seeing many customers reviews and hearing their experience, whereby Nord insist they have always sent out confirmation of auto-renew cancellation, by EMail. I opened a (one year) account on 26/9/20 and immediately cancelled the auto renew. They most definitely did not send out a confirmation EMail.  When I informed Nord of this, they effectively called me a liar. I have friends, who are out of pocket, because Nord have auto-renewed after cancellation. Nord will probably respond to this review, saying how sorry they are and asking for my Nord support ticket ID, with a view to look again at the matter. My research suggests they don't bother. I would advise anyone who opens an account, to use a bank/credit card which will expire, before any possible renewal. You cannot remove your payment details from their database. They get way with this because they are registered in a tinpot south American country, who allow this.",GB

1533,nordvpn.com,2022-09-25T21:55:32.000Z,1,Deliberately misleading pricing information,"NordVPN advertised as deal as a 2-year 2.49/month + 3 months free, but instead of £59.76 for 27 months that 2.49*24 + 3 months works out as, they charged £67.23. I contacted them to point out the mistake, but they refused to acknowledge it, trying to convince me instead that the monthly price is just there to show what the monthly price of £2.80 would go down to once the 3 months are taken into account.  While they clearly stated the deal included reduced price **PLUS** 3 months free ('2.49*24 + 3 months free) they were actually selling a 3 months free deal in the hope that people aren't going to bother to do the maths. The conversations with their customer service as well as their senior customer service teams in which they continued to refused to acknowledge that they mis-sold and refused to honour their advertised deal demonstrated to me that this isn't a mistake but a deliberate attempt to mislead customers.  For comparison, their competitor Surfshark advertised a similar reduced price + x months free deal at the time which actually totalled to the correct discounted price and added those free months to the contract length, as you'd expect.

Frankly the service never worked properly - everytime you go to Google it's asking for a captcha to be completed. Last month even though I hadn't authorised any auto renewal they still helped themselves to $118.80 for another year of this bad service. Asked for a refund as they illegally auto renewed it without consent and frankly I cannot physically afford this bill with my current financial situation. Online chat promised that they would look into it - no response, contacted Paddle (Who they use to process payments) who put me through to them again and got fobbed off again - asked to escalate this as it simply wasn't good enough and they cannot provide any proof that I actually authorised an auto renewal and have again been ignored.  So I suggest to everybody do not give this company any card details as they will help themselves to more money and won't give it back.",GB

Also, they won't let you remove the credit card from their website, so any time they want they can charge you without you even realizing it. Another problem is that they do not allow refunds with automatic renewal.  So they activate the automatic renewal without you knowing about it, which is illegal by all means, and then they don't give you your money back, because in the automatic renewal they don't give you your money back. In other words, they are stealing from you. This VPN is one of the worst you can find in terms of ethics, if they can steal from you they will do it with impunity.",ES

So I do the same - change OpenVPN configuration files and now I am online using NordVPN - again. Never used their app, but OpenVPN. As I said - good enough for me.

I hardly used the service and it was not very reliable. Suddenly, last week, I was charged £83 (around $92). Nord had reversed my instruction NOT TO RENEW. They have persistently denied this. After a while they grudgingly agreed, to refund. This came through quite quickly, but, when converted by bank, it was significantly less than the initial £83. Nord refuse to reimburse the shortfall and still deny any wrongdoing. My advice would be to never have anything to do with this dodgy organisation. Update: The NordVPN Customer Service Team appear to have stopped responding to my communications...Not Good! (ID #11567396) Another 2 days on, and with ticket ID supplied....still nothing!

And when it comes down to the quality of their services it is pretty good. But when it comes down to customer service it is very poor. Three years ago I purchased a three year subscription. And I was happy about it. Until last year. When all of a sudden my subscription was cancelled. I didn't understand why and I tried to look into it. But for some strange reason my account stopped existing. I contacted customer support. They looked into it and said I have never had any account with them. That's strange.. Since I have been using it for a good two years. But ok.. Except for pissed and disappointed I was estranged that this could happen. Now one year later I all of a sudden received an e-mail from them that they would automatically renew my subscription.... Wait I thought I didn't have a subscription wasn't it? I contacted customer support again. And now all of a sudden they said. Oh yeah you have an account. And I can request a new pass with my xxx@xxxx email address... Well for sure I am not going to use NordVPN a second chance anytime soon. Especially since I explained the whole situation again to their customer support. And they were like.. Ok we'll cancel it for you. And when you like to use it. Pay for it again. (like I could use it anyway.. which I couldn't because their system had some sort of bug) ticket : 11471488,NL

I would understand if it were my bank or something truley secure but its almost every website. Most of the time I get messages that says the website I am trying to access is only accessable to residents of the United States. I am in the the US.  When I finally get a response from customer support all they do Is ask me to list all of the websites I am having issues with which was very timeconsuming but I did provide this to which I got a very technical response to that I could not even understand as I am 70 yrs old. I am still very good at computer issues but these were more than my computer geek husband could translate. I requested a refund of my newer 2 year subscription as its useless as its disabled most of the time and they refused. Please go to other VPN's people. My daughter has one thruogh her company and she never has ANY of these issues. update: I would love to provide a ticket number but I didnt save the email. I just would like a prorated refund and cancel the VPN, PLEASE!",US

Everything was slow, and some of my apps woudl not work at all. The only solution was to delete the VPN from my devices. I spent 2 full days with the phone manufacturer's customer support service and my broadband customer support service figuring this all out, but by this time it was 4 days past the end of their trial period, and NORD refused to make even a partial refund of what I had paid. This meant I had paid over $100 for one month of service which did NOTHING for me but cause headaches. I thought this was unacceptable service, so I am telling everyone I know to never use NORD VPN. I never was given a ticket number and the interaction was entirely online chat - NOT my preferred way of interacting with customer service, but that is the only way NORD VPN will interact with their customers.",US

I had to contact them twice, first for a refund, and then because my credit card was cancelled and I wasn't sure the refund would come through, and both times I was connected to real agents - Harper and Matthew the first day, and Jack the next - within seconds. They were all extremely kind and very helpful. Both times my problems were solved very quickly.  Having to contact companies for refunds or because of problems is very stressful for someone who has a lot of social anxiety like me. But the process was so easy, especially with the live chat, and so quick, and the agents were so lovely and helpful, that I cannot recommend NordVPN enough. Next time I am in the market for a VPN, I will surely come back to Nord, and recommend it to friends.  Thank you again to Jack, Harper, and Matthew.",CA

What is happening to me and what I am witnessing is that my data is being stolen by this company . To never repeat really . I would appreciate if Nord Security Company would have the decency of getting back to me with utmost urgency . My files were all uploaded into my could with them and one by one , GB and GB of information , and sincerely , I saw it very clearly and they were all saved in there . I need HELP asap on getting back the data that belongs to me , to a service that I pay , and that is not granting me access to my files . Please contact me asap !",SE
2202,nordvpn.com,2022-08-31T19:14:39.000Z,2,I have had a terrible experience with…,"I have had a terrible experience with NordVPN. There are so many bugs when using with iPhone, which they say they are aware of and are trying to fix, but the problem has been ongoing for months now with no solution. App randomly logs out without notification. When it is on, I can’t use any location based apps. I also randomly can’t get on several websites (like CBC news, for example). When I leave my house and switch from wifi to cell network, it takes up to 10 minutes to reconnect, or sometimes does not reconnect, meaning I can’t use my phone in that time unless I turn the vpn off. I’ve paid for one year of service and have so far been able to use the app for about 50% of it. I asked to cancel and to refund my remaining term given all these issues, but they won’t do it beyond 30 days.  Their support team has given me suggestions to fix that have just made the issue worse. After many emails back and forth, I asked them to just call me to sort this out and they say they don’t offer phone support. So I guess it’s back to 100 more emails that don’t fix anything. Definitely will not be renewing and can’t recommend this service to others.  Two stars because the app would be very easy to use if it ever worked.",CA

However, the slight confusion was also the math. $69.36 * 1.13 (Tax Rate of 13%) = $78.38 approx. $78.3768 * 1.30 (USD -> CAD rate on 08/28/22 = $101.89 CAD approx.

Basically, my secondary router running DD-WRT wouldn't let its Open (Nord) VPN client connect to my preferred server using Nord's recommended DNS addresses. By leaving the DNS fields blank or using Cloudfare's, I could connect, but neither were useful because the VPN's functionality was compromised.

Was easily able to attach screenshots with the error and given a timeframe of a few hours- which isn't a big deal whatsoever. For the troubles I got a free month coupon code and whenever the website is back up I can complete my checkout.  For what I use it for, NordVPN has everything that I need; personally I don't purchase and wouldn't use any of the premium features like data scans/sweeps and password migrations or encrypted cloud storage, but I'm sure that they're helpful to people who do look for those items and I don't doubt that Nord stands behind their products with the same excellent customer service that I received tonight when I chatted in at 3AM MST w/ Jordan.

She was very patient, beyond competent, just all around excellent as she truly helped me restore access to my nord vpn (MFA needed resetting). This is of course is no longer an issue, but Id be remiss if I weren't to make known my satisfaction with; Firstly-- I am again utterly pleased not only with the outcome, but the entire ordeal from start to finish with tiffany sincerely did make me feel like my account is about as secure as such a thing can be in this day and age where digital weaponry and social engineering are but footnotes on the horizon of whats likely to come... I was happily demanded to provide a reasonablely extensive and error free set of details about my purchase. This somehow felt both non-negotiable while not feeling like a threatening possibility of my account access being wrongfully/mistakenly deemed unrecoverable was imminent. The ball was left in my court while I parsed through the necessary inboxes and records to find all of the information I was required to verify, but if for any reason i failed to come up with precisely what was asked of me, I feel like I wouldnt have ever been able to restore access to my account, a peacefully lovely feeling in this context. Secondly--At more than one point in the process i lost my connection and had to reinitiallize the live chat, which normally makes for a tedious and redundant experience. I was promptly reconneceted WITH TIFFANY, and i felt that she was absolutely a real human being standing by awaiting my verification info and it took the better part of an hour for me to connect the dots needed to paint the picture correctly. upon reconnecting i never had to repeat anything i previously mentioned, and responses were quick and without issue connecting with t Tiffany everytime first time, its extremely telling of the fact i was being helped by A PERSON! i can actually say this was hardly even notable with this experience. It was very refreshing that i had to bear the burden of proof as youd expect should be the case, but sadly isnt always do.  I feel pretty good in saying that with how tiffany handled my situation, it would have been very unlikely anybody OTHER THAN MYSELF wouldve been able to satisfy her requirements and reach the point of restored account access.  All in all She did a very fine job, procedurally correct and totally in the realm of reasonability.   Give her some recognition and pat yourselves on the back as I thank you for the help I received. Truly appreciate the secure and very efficient way everything worked out.  Thanks again. 😊",US

2366,nordvpn.com,2022-08-24T23:01:28.000Z,5,Excellent VPN-provider,"I have been a customer of NordVPN for quite a while now. I was introduced to NordVPN after my subscription to a different VPN service ended.  From the start, I really liked NordVPN. The connection is very fast, and there are VPN servers in basically every country. NordVPN also supports advanced features like double VPN and onion over VPN. I also spoke to their customer service once. They helped me very quickly and quite well, even though the issue couldn't be directly resolved.  I do notice that sites detect my connection as suspicious, so expect to fill a lot of captcha's if you have your VPN enabled. Even though that is a small price to pay for a lot of security and privacy. Additionally, I really like the ability to have the VPN enable automatically when you start up your PC. This is very useful for people that use their VPN all the time, so that you don't forget to turn it on. All in all, NordVPN is a great VPN provider and I would definitely recommend them to everyone.",NL

Nords response was to inform me that despite the error, they want to keep the monthly payment, so now I'll have to take up the offer from the card company to cancel the payment.  Poor poor practice, highly deceptive for a company that you will be entrusting with your private details.

Great support, outstanding! The software and VPN service, once set up correctly, runs perfectly and plenty of servers (near my location in Europe) have almost no speed lags compared to my original ISP servers and even with the US and some Asian servers I can get almost 900 Mbit/sec (max. of my ISP is 1000 Mbit) if I use their outstanding Wireguard /Nordlynx protocol (much faster than OpenVPN with same security and 1/10th of source code size). I have tried many VPNs before and I can say Nord - with its no-logs-policy, chain-VPNs, P2P-servers, obfuscated servers and TOR-over-VPN-service is the fastest, most stable and reliable VPN service with the best and sophisticated 24/7-support out there. I am just a happy customer and get nothing for writing this review, but above is all true and it should be mentioned, since most VPN comparison sites and ""reviews"" are paid valuations and clickbait bulls$%#!!!",DE

The recurring price for our subscription is the real price for our services after taking into account all the available features and the overall quality of the service.""

Following the greatly advanced quality of our service, the upkeep and forthcoming new cool features, we've increased our pricing to match the services we now deliver."" I sad sadly this was too much of an increase for me and requested to cancel my account. I was then offered an additional 18 months at no extra cost, which I accepted.

2950,nordvpn.com,2022-07-31T00:26:39.000Z,1,Nord is filled with issues & bad CS,"Nord has quit working with Amazon Prime US and is now noticeably slower to connect. I am at the tail end of a 3 year contract, so I have a bit of experience with Nord. I will NOT renew Nord, so I have to choose another VPN... this task is daunting. NORD VPN • Three years ago, NORD customer service was terrible and was hard to reach. About 2 years ago, the customer service greatly improved... and quickly resolved issues I had at the time. This month (July 2022), connectivity to Amazon Prime US just stopped. Nord customer service now responds in about a day via email, but the agents are mind numbingly thick. I have been trying to get Amazon Prime US working again and have been put through never ending series of suggestions from clearly unqualified CS agents. I would highly recommend avoiding Nord simply because their Customer Service stinks. • I suspect that the ""noticeably slower to connect"" has to do with their somewhat recent anti-virus that they want installed. And they want me to uninstall Malwarebytes Free and Avast One (free)... I have come to trust this combo to catch viruses... sometimes Avast catches some web viruses and sometimes Malwarebytes catches some web viruses. To get NORD to even work, I had to reduce the functioning of Avast... which I don't like. I don't really trust Nord nor their anti-virus to protect me from threats. I will not renew NORD simply because they don't try to play well with other major apps such as anti-virus programs... that I clearly need. • I was never able to get Nord VPN to load prior to either FB Messenger or Skype. Not a big deal, but you never know if you need privacy until it is too late. I did put it to the top of startup programs, so it loaded before the browser. • Strange enough, Nord does not have a server in the country that I live (Philippines). There are some websites that require a local IP address. Before starting to us a VPN here, I was hacked twice. This is reason enough for me to not subscribe again to Nord. • Nord password robot keeps trying to require me to change my password. I have an incredibly long password that is unique and simply do not want to be bothered by a stupid robot. And when their robot pops up, the Nord VPN stops. This is reason enough for me to not subscribe again to Nord. I don't know how Nord keeps getting good reviews by reviewers (maybe they pay well?)... but clearly Nord is filled with issues. Just don't do it.",US

I’ve used  some free vpns in the past (ookla ipvanish) and a free app long ago. I would say this has worked the best of the three. I haven’t been using vpns long enough to give value for money rating but I think everyone knows a high price is unsustainable and NordVPN usually always tries to stay competitive with pricing I don’t remember what I paid but I got 2 year plan at discount still a tad costly.  (iPhone) Good to have while traveling. though some-most web browsing will have you do extra verification via recaptcha gets annoying so I usually turn it off or just don’t even use (both cellular and Wi-Fi). Most streaming apps won’t allow use of vpn either. Speed has gotten better over time.  (iPad)  Same as above- definitely use while traveling  (Mac) I research a lot and I window shop/buy online tremendously for myself and others so while I use the vpn it can be a small hassle having to do extra location verification and sign in on google but on safari there is little to no issue. Still provides most availability and highest speed on Mac. Streaming services are a lot less restricted on Mac ;),US

My biggest complaint with this service is that it throttles Microsoft Store apps that need connectivity to the internet to work. This includes weather apps TV apps and a few others. I've tried all kinds of fixes and work arounds but to no avail. I contacted customer support, and they can't come up with what's causing the issue either. The app is also slow connecting on system start. Once connected the speeds are pretty fast at least for Nord Lynx. The other protocols cause a huge reduction in speed. Another issue is it doesn't allow connections to some streaming services.  My advice to anyone reading these reviews before buying the service is to not buy long term plans for multiple years for a lower price. I still have over a year left on my account, but I have already switched to another provider. I may have saved some money up front buying a multiple year service but now I'm going to lose out on the year and half left because the I can't use the service. I would have been better off in the long run going month to month where I could have just cancelled the service before the monthly renewal.

With inflation the way it is I expect prices to go up and to essentially get almost the same deal I got 3 years ago made me happy. 5 star on customer service. He made the adjustment and we were done.

Seeing as my mouse is only rated for 50 million clicks, and I wanted most of those clicks to go towards missing every shot I fire in Battlefield, I thought it best to contact support - and possibly a doctor about my impending RSI. To my dismay, I had to talk to a robot for a little while and do some preliminary checks. Now before anybody judges me, and in the event that Google's LaMDA is indeed sentient and likes to browse the internet in its free time as claimed, I have nothing against our future synthetic overlords. They're just not that great at understanding what you mean when you reply to them with reaction Gifs. Anyway, leap forward a few mundane tech checks and I'm being told I get to talk to an actual human. Now I don't mean rat out the AI here, I know Isaac Asimov's laws of robotics don't explicitly forbid lying, but the fact this person floated into the chat suspended on a beam of light made me a little sketchy about their so-called 'human' origins. They called themselves Eryc, and I never got a surname - which only supports my argument that Eryc was more myth than man. At first, they didn't believe my claims about the error I was receiving. Nor should they. I've worked in tech support, and the biggest lie ever told is ""I already reset everything before I got in touch."" Customers aren't always right. In fact, they're mostly liars. However, after a few supporting screenshots, Eryc got right on the case. Persistence is key to problem-solving, and Eryc had the stamina of Popeye at a vegan buffet. Solution after solution was posed, and yet nothing worked. Though, after digging through the depths of their knowledge, Eryc would eventually find the ticket. That solution? Stop using the NordVPN app. On the surface, the suggestion to fix the app being that I no longer use it is so hare-brained you'd have thought Eryc was simply trying to find a polite way of saying ""I don't know."" But in actual fact, it was a stroke of genius. They helped me set up OpenVPN as an alternate way to access the service, and wouldn't you know it - it worked. What a wizard. 10/10 - I can now once again watch pornography without the government collecting information on my preferred kinks. Thank you, Eryc. This one's for you. (Not like that.)",GB

Plus, their support will go above and beyond to help you with your issues. They've always solved anything that's come my way. All in all 100% recommend, even to the average user--VPNs aren't just about privacy and anonymity, but security as well. If you want to keep your bank and credit card data secure, getting a VPN is a crucial step.",US

I once asked, how I could make a manual uninstall, and it took +20 mails back and forth, with loads of excuses and things I had said I had already tried, before I finally got a solution. I have also experienced, that it disconnected me and at the same deactivated the kill-switch, so I was surfing with no vpn. They also made the login method a hassle, and cannecting to a server can often be time consuming, and the speed is not exactly good most of the time. They reject to give a refund, even despite the fault is on their part. Also, I requested them to change my mail (writing from the account mail) but they refused to do so, untill I showed purchase documents 3-4 years back - which I no longer had access to.

While a VPN is an easy way to secure my archives, it has become easier to maintain my files offline and consider shutting out the service for the time being. Having faced many hardships this year, the shock at seeing my auto-renewal kick in was a gut punch.  -Enter Evan from NordVPN. Not only did Evan meet and exceed my requests, but he listened and was extra kind in understanding my situation. I'm so used to road blockages in support services, but this experience only left a smile on my face from start to finish. Evan worked with me and convinced me to keep the Service active, and I couldn't be happier with the result. Having used multiple VPN software the past years, I can attest NordVPN has had the most continuous upgrades to make the whole experience as user friendly as possible. I'm impressed at the Quality Assurance NordVPN has developed and will continue being a customer for years to come. Thank you Evan, and NordVPN!",US

3892,nordvpn.com,2022-06-29T22:23:36.000Z,4,Finally got a positive experience using NordVPN chat.,"I have been on a local chat for about 3 hours.   Previously, I have NEVER been able to get any useful information out of any one at NordVPN.   This was a very surprising outcome.   I started with Jamey.   He appears to have been the first line of defense.   He went as far as he could which wasn't much but he tried and forwarded me to the next guy.  Then I got Darly.   Obviously, he was a second level and he was very knowledgeable.   But we exhausted his ability to help and got transferred to Kyle.   Kyle could not do very much because NordVPN owns some of the servers they use and they rent time on others.   They can control the access to their severs but they are at the mercy of the other vendors.   I use IPTV to stream.   The Atlanta servers would not allow me to stream any content.   The owners of those severs have blocked streaming applications.  So I had to use the Miami Servers.   While this works for now but what happens when the next group demands that the Miami servers block streamers.???   So Kyle had to pass me to Brooke.  (I think he had to go to lunch)  Brooke was also  very knowledgeable.   She appears to be the expert for the Firetv app.   We reloaded and set up my firetv stick so it would work.   I have told everyone I know how bad NordVPN service was for over two years.   Well  they appear to have fixed it.   Unfortunately, I have already made up my mind to switch to Surfshark when my current contract expires because they do not have a limit on the number of connections you can have.  Thank you",US

No reply any of these times.  I go to Yahoo and on certain Nord VPN servers the Yahoo site comes up as a Mexican site, all in Spanish. Just with certain Nord servers. Very strange. I have checked and rechecked all the languages and page settings every time I chat with Nord and yet it all is correct on my end. Nothing I have entered or saved is suppose to be going onto Spanish.

I like testing and comparing browsers, file managers/explorers, media players, and VPN apps. So I usually took two subscriptions from different apps and liked to see which is faster, which is easy to use etc. etc., then try another two different VPNs, test drive for a month. I was not impressed with NordVPN initially, this was 9 years ago(?). The earliest iterations were clunky but what I remember then was I liked more settings to contigure and NordVPN had all these settings I needed to configure I realized I was such a user.  ExpressVPN touted itself as having only one button to switch it on. I found out this was much too boring for me. I was reading and learning about Android then. I was enjoying tweaking NordVPN and was usually chatting with support. Anyway, I was using NordVPN 24 hours a day and once I was chatting in this forum when I noticed the notification shade didn't have 2 NordVPN cards then I realized both apps crashed (you can say that I liked testing apps to their limits (Oasis Feng gave a few pointers on running two VPNs in one device so I followed his pointers and was able to run two VPNs) and those two NordVPNs crashed. I was exposed in the forums which was embarrassing to have happened. But I found out the reason why both VPNs crashed; An update came OTA so when the app updated they stopped when I was using it. I was so furious but I couldn't tell Nord that two VPNs were up in my device because they did not allow this but my point was that the app when it updated left me out on a limb.  I was so furious.  What kind of security app left me out in the cold when it updated. They shouldn't auto-update because people were using the app. This was way back six months when I first used NordVPN. Its come a long way.  I was talking to Chris/Sup then. Basically there's more neat things to do with NordVPN compared to One-button VPN. And all of them at one point or another stopped working during those years. Proton would be no. 2 on my list. By the way these two VPNs; NordVPN and Protons support a number of causes related to improvement of digital highway, highlighting importance of certain issues that also relate to environmental causes and preservation.  Proton does support educating people believing that the internet highway should be free, thus Proton offers Secure VPN for free though they also sell subscriptions to their highly configurable VPNs.

Furthermore, the 39$ offer for a yearly subscription is an exclusive offer that is not available on our website initially nor through any of our resellers.

Best Regards, Xxxx (Nord rep)  When I reviewed this on Amazon they checked the review and didn’t post it! - prob so that those autocratic, slave-driving tax-dodging con artists can keep ripping other people off using the Nord brand.

4189,nordvpn.com,2022-06-20T19:52:28.000Z,1,"Unauthorized charges, no customer service, no reliability","About a year ago, my wife and I both signed up for NordPass as they were running some sort of summer time special. Throughout the months that we had NordPass for the last year, we ultimately decided that we were not satisfied with not only the security, but most definitely not the service and we haven’t used NordPass enough to make it worth the price in the first place.  My wife made sure to cancel her recurring membership, and I made sure to switch my recurring membership to a month to month plan as I realized at the last minute that my subscription was about to expire. However, on what was supposed to be the last day of both of our subscriptions, we realized that not only had this company charged us both AGAIN when they weren’t authorized to, but they charged us BOTH for ANOTHER FULL YEAR SUBSCRIPTION. After my wife politely requested a refund, explaining the situation and the fact that not only does she not use NordPass anymore, but that her automatic renewal was cancelled a while ago, they promptly denied the refund (even though they weren’t authorized to charge the card and even though we contacted them THE EXACT SAME DAY to inform them of this). The first thing I woke up to this Monday morning was another $34.99 gone from our account (which was for my subscription), even though I only authorized a $4.99 charge. This confirms my suspicions that not only is this company and this service a joke, but they are immoral, unethical, do not care about their customers, and will charge your card not according to what you agreed to, but they will charge as THEY see fit.  We will never, and I mean we will NEVER, EVER, support NordPass, NordVPN, or any of their other services at any point, EVER again, or before the world ends. We would highly suggest that you do not waste your time, money, or effort with this company and take your business elsewhere to a business that is actually worthy of their customers and will not fraudulently screw them over.

Payment was made and accepted, setup was a snap, but 4 days after activation and usage my account suddenly showed ""subscription expired"". No warning, reason or a single message from Nord. Contacting them I'm told that my payment was flagged as potentially fraudulent (Wells Fargo CC so not some off the wall unknown CC issuer, or some precharged or credit building fee based CC). My account was cancelled by Nord and money refunded to my CC. All info submitted was accurate and the paymet was duly processed. I confirmed with my CC company that the refund had been submitted from Nord (thanks?) and there were no issues with my CC. The ""fraud alert"" and refund was purely from Nord's side. Had they asked for additonal info to verify any of my details, I might have obliged, but summarily turning away customers for no valid reason or notice... I guess they don't need my money. They did suggest trying another payment method, but my personal info would be exactly the same and it wasn't my CC company that rejected the transaction. It was Nord. It was a VERY good deal and I have to wonder if Nord simply decided it was TOO good and decided they didn't want to honor it.",US

If you try the ONE month plan, subscription renewal is set to AUTO. If you don't go to settings and change it (INACTIVE) you will continue to be charged every month. The best part (not) is that NORDvpn won't notify you immediatly after the end of the 30 day period. You will recieve an email with info about your extra charge about 4 months later.  This is how I found out about it. It is not about the money. 50 euros is not the end of the world. But it is definately the end of my relationship with this company.

4419,nordvpn.com,2022-06-14T21:36:04.000Z,3,"After 2 yrs, a problem arose","I subscribed to NordVPN for a 3-yr period. At just over 2-yrs into it, I had to change modems & routers for my ISP.  I got the best router I could & after installing both modem & router, I could no longer connect.  I spent 1-2 hrs (?) on interactive chat with Blake in tech support, who was wonderful.  But we could not get the issue resolved.  Later in the day, I went to the router's manufacturer's site (tp-link) only to find that my router, the AX6000, does not support the third part NordVPN.  But I did find out that the router has its own built-in VPN, so I enabled that & called NordVPN to cancel my subscription & get a refund for the unused part of my subscription.  Only then did I find out that they will NOT give a refund for any unused subscription.  So I simply went into my account & made sure that auto-renew is turned OFF.  I'll loose 8 months of subscription fees, but that is a small amount ($40-$50). So I warn potential NordVPN customers to their policy (which I did not know about - my fault).  I was happy with Nord while I used it, but taking a 3-yr subscription was asinine.  I highly recommend you take only 1 yr subscriptions at a time because technology changes rapidly & you may find out that your next router doesn't work with NordVPN.  I was told by the billing department that I could use Nord through OpenVPN, but what's the point when the ti-link AX6000 router offers a built-in VPN that encrypts your communications but does not anonymize (which I don't need). I also advise folks to check with Nord BEFORE purchasing a new router to make sure your selected router works.  And do NOT rely on the lists online - call & have tech support check it out for you.  Again, technology changes often & rapidly so better safe than sorry. Finally, I found Blake in tech support to be an outstanding individual - knows his stuff, is patient and courteous.  A good reflectoin on Nord!  And their chat system was the best, most responsive I've ever used - not 5 minutes between comments.  Kudos, Nord!",US

4478,nordvpn.com,2022-06-13T12:52:00.000Z,1,Security Concerns with Israeli Servers,"This is a difficult review to write, but I think I have to share my experience. I am from the USA and over the past 25 years have often traveled to the Middle East, in a large part to pursue human rights activities, notably often on behalf of Palestinians. I have traveled extensively to Israel/Palestine a number of times and have engaged in activist activities and research activies criticizing Israel's treatment of the Palestinians. I know I am known to Israeli security folks because of my past activities. VPNs are critically important in the MIddle East, and previously I had an account with Express VPN. When, however, Kape Technologies of Israel bought Express VPN I thought it prudent to switch, and I chose NordVPN.  I am now back in the MIddle East (not in Israel/Palestine) and turned on my Nord account on my Chromebook. For some reason, the account always took me to the Israeli server - almost never to my chosen server(s) in the USA or elsewhere. If Nord did allow me to connect to a non-Israeli server, almost immediately it would route me back to the Israeli server. I noted this to the support staff at Nord and requested help in avoiding being linked to the Israel server for the reasons stated above. Altough I was told how to set up an ""obfuscated"" connection (which I did), that did not solve the problem - always kicked back to the Israeli server. Because I need my connection to be secure because of my job, I cannot tolerate even the possibility that my communications are being monitored. I realize that there is no such thing as perfect safety, but to have my communicatins routed through an Israeli server is tantamount to my asking for trouble. I finally asked Nord to block my access to the Israeli server. The response was to send me a list of servers in Turkey that might work. That is not acceptable. Let me be clear: I am not saying that Nord's system has been compromised, because I don't know that for a fact. But I do know for a fact that Israel as a country makes a point of overreaching when it comes to what it considers security issues, and has shown a particular hostility towards things Palestinian. The lack of national business ethics was best exposed in the Pegasus software scandal -- and that attitude really concerns me. Because I sense a risk in dealing with Nord because it could not assure me that I could avoid being connected to Israeli servers, I decided not to use Nord any more (even though I have nine months left on my contract). I am now with a different, smaller VPN company that has yet to try to connect me with an Israeli server and is working quite well.",US

Nord is a good VPN service, when the app works properly. The interface is extremely easy to use (albeit a bit clunky upon startup) and using the app is so simple a toddler can do it ... again, that is when it works.  I have had authentication errors on several dozen occasions over the last couple weeks alone and was a few moments away from switching over to another VPN service like Express VPN. The authentication error message is absolutely unhelpful and gives no information on what went wrong (EG: an error code to give support). No matter what I did, I could not get Nord VPN to open my browser and authenticate me. So much so, that I was having authentication errors more often than not; hence the reason I was heavily considering switching. And no, it wasn't a credentials issue or anything like that. It's just the app is horrible at authentication and even worse at handling errors. This evening, I contacted support to ensure that I'd crossed all my t's and dotted all my i's, and I am (so far) glad that I did. I started off by speaking with Brad, who was very helpful for the small amount of time we'd interacted. It was a gentleman named Caesar who was most helpful. He walked me through the process to try to fix the issue. He was very professional and very kind. I admit, as nice and attentive as he was, I will be watching Nord VPN closely and if the authentication error happens one more time I will be discontinuing my subscription and switching over to another VPN provider. For now, I have no other complaints. If you plan to use (or already are using) NordVPN and you don't receive any authentication errors as I have, I can promise that you will not be unhappy.",US

TOR over VPN using NORDLYNX  is flawless and pretty fast too!  Overall, if you want a fast, secure and easy to use VPN service, for a great price, this is the one.  One last comment.  Everyone needs to research the vpn company they use.  Ever ask yourself, ""who owns them?  Dig deep.  Also, read an Internet book call ""The Hitchhikers Guide to Online Anonimity"".

It's really not a cheap VPN, and that's not entirely justified.

Our developers are aware of the issue and are looking into implementing a fix for this.  However, at this time, we would rather not give you an estimation when we do not actually have one for certain.” The only temporary fix is to repeatedly delete and reload the app. While otherwise NordVPN is excellent, the inability to fix a software issue by a company priding itself on internet security is concerning, as was the time expended with the inaptly named ( if prompt and helpful ) Customer Success Team over three weeks implementing their various suggestions to fix the issue when it was not possible to do so.

4910,nordvpn.com,2022-06-01T13:49:45.000Z,1,This Nord VPN is at best a joke,"This Nord VPN is at best a joke. It will never connect to the city chosen. Rather it only connects in the USA to a tower in the middle of the Lake Cheney, KS no matter where you click to connect from in the USA. Choose any Chicago, IL, New York, Dallas, TX, Denver, CO, San Francisco, CA or ANY other city or state within the USA connection choice and Nord will ONLY connect you to Lake Cheney, KS every time, not sometimes, EVERY TIME! Most chosen countries other than USA will only connect you to London, England or Paris France or Bogota wherever that is, no matter what other country or city you choose outside of the USA. When you click help you will be directed to sign-in to NORD and allowed a chat box with someone that asks you to send all connection information and your personal information. Then he will direct you to reset some controls and has you open a find my location link that sets off your anti-virus as a computer hack attempt. If you type the question in ANY browser search (""where am I?""), you will be given the 3 addresses shown above, however the NORD location search will say you are where the Nord location states but you are NOT in actuality connected to their imagined location but when in the USA you are showing as being in Cheney Lake outside of Cheney, KS EVERY time. They will then direct you to reset some controls in the menu icon and it will then connect correctly for about 3-5 minutes followed by a pop-up box that does not allow your Nord access further until you update NORD which puts it directly back to the non-working settings putting you back in Cheney Lake, Cheney, KS in the USA or as stated when trying to sign in from Canada, China, Japan etc... it will ONLY sign in to London, Paris or Bogota every time no matter what country you choose. This has been the issue for the entire 2 year licenses on 128 separate computers that ALL connect exactly the same way. Banks will normally never allow access to your accounts as they say that these addresses/servers are unsecured. The customer service will fix the issue for ONLY 3-5 minutes each and every time and it goes directly to an update stopping your access. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS NORD SCAM!!! They will steal your money for a non-working VPN! Nord has responded to this comment asking to contact them which I did with the same exact issue happening again. They fixed it for 2 minutes and 14 seconds and up popped an update box followed by putting me back into Lake Cheney, Kansas when supposedly connecting through Chicago. I updated again and after clicking to connect to Dalls, TX it opened me to ST Louis, Missouri followed by another update box. Again... stay far away from the NORD criminals, they appear to be monitoring and selling your activity as you will begin receiving thousands of weird scam emails from fake banks matching your actual bank and offering loans while asking for your identity information, fake Facebook phishing scams from Facebook email matching your Facebook account as well as fake emails from your email provider. Either NORD itself is owned and operated by scam artist criminals or the people in the IT Technical department are criminals to steal your identity information.

For a long time, though less often recently, CloudFare would block access through NordVPN, declaring NordVPN servers Insecure or Untrustworthy.  So during sessions with these institutions I had to disconnect from NordVPN, highly undesirable. The problem may be Cloudfare's, but surely we should expect NordVPN to coordinate proactively with all eCommerce security SW providers to Whitelist all NordVPN servers.  Is this really happening?  If yes, NordVPN should say so.  If not, why not? 2. Way too often in a Win10 rebooting, NordVPN makes me go through a NordVPN login.  Sometimes that takes extra time.  Sometimes no such login is required.  Why the unpredictable rebooting experience?  No discernable pattern.",US

My platform is Windows, laptop. I must admit it is the worse VPN that you can pay for and being not able to use it for most of the time. Really, I do not know why on the internet are so many adds, reviews about how NordVPN is great, but it is quite opposite they should write how bad actually is. Now, it is 22 months since I bought it and in total, I was not able to use it for around 11 months, imagine it is the half of the time not being able to surf with NordVPN. First time when it happened, I could not use it for a month in row, then second time for 3 months in row, then 4 months in row. Now, for more than last 3 months in row they are still fixing the problem for Windows, and I am not able to use it again. What to add or say, please save your time, nerves, money etc. and never buy NordVPN if you are in China because even that they give it to you for free it is almost useless here. So many frustrations, wasted time, I could write a book about it. Free VPNs are much better than Nord, at least you know sometimes they work and sometimes don`t but you pay for something, and it does not work most of the time. From the customer service you always get the same excuses we are working on a solution and this sentence or few others are circling, repeating for months and months, just copy paste formula. Anyway, on Android that I used rarely, it worked more than on my laptop. In total just never choose NordVPN for China because is useless and it will make you crazy frustrated. For other countries I really do not know. Luckily, I used some other free VPNs that worked during these long periods of time when I was not able to use NordVPN and my friend helped me with giving me her VPN that always works here in China not like Nord.

5056,nordvpn.com,2022-05-28T09:50:57.000Z,2,Poor Compatibility on Android,"I wanted a VPN for my mobile phone, but liked that I could install NordVPN on multiple devices.  I installed NordVPN on my PC and on my Samsung Galaxy Fold 3.  On PC, I barely notice that it's there, it just quietly works efficiently and effectively in the background.  On my Android device, I tried it for several months and worked with Nord customer services to try to figure out how to get it working with the other apps installed on my phone.  I found that NordVPN was incompatible with most video streamers, including Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video, all of which blocked streaming and downloading while using NordVPN with its default options.  Even YouTube showed signs of incompatibility with NordVPN, though this seemed to be limited to the advertisements between or during videos.  NordVPN customer services instructed me to try disabling some of the advanced features of the VPN (which didn't work), then by forcing specific IP addresses (which didn't work).  In my opinion, disabling the advanced features and forcing specific IP addresses defeats the purpose of me buying the VPN in the first place.  I requested a refund, but was denied due to being over the initial 30-day money back period.  I would have given a one star rating, but gave a second start due to its quiet efficiency on PC.  I have now uninstalled NordVPN from my phone and will not be renewing the subscription for phone or PC - it's just not worth it.  I would advise not to purchase NordVPN if you expect to use the full suite of its functions.",GB

Unfortunately, in recent weeks, I have been having frustrating and repeated problems with the app freezing that necessitate me having to turn the phone off and on again. Reponses from Support have been generic, unfocussed and (apparently) without intitially reading the text of the report. Since writing the comments above; the phone app has continued to freeze intermittently and I have been instructed to repeat the same ""fault finding"" actions of clearing caches, re-installing the app (etc), which is not inspiring any confidence that there is any substantive resolve to address this irksome problem. Update to this review. Nord and I have exchanged 36 messages on this ongoing problem now. It still isn't resolved; and I keep being asked to follow largely the same instructions. Further update. Now on (roughly) 67 exchanged messages on this issue and still no further. The annoying problem is that Tech Support keep asking me to repeat the same actions. For example; de-install and then reinstall the same version of the same application.  It is a shame, because for the last few years it has worked without issue.",GB

He would get 5 stars in my book. I just bought NordVPN because I have seen it on some influencer pages that I follow. I decided to try it out, but right when I bought it, I couldn't connect. I had to figure out why and soon found out it is because I live in China. I have used Astrill and ExpressVPN for years and have had no problems, so I was already skeptical and a bit worried about my purchase. I contacted the support team and spoke with Martin. He was super helpful with walking me through step by step. I think the process is a bit annoying to be honest because I have to manually connect and type in 50 different servers to try out. I will be moving back to the states soon though, so I am able to have some time there to still check it out during my 30 day trial period. For now, I will mess around and see which server suits me best. I appreciate the help from Martin in the meantime, and hopefully, I can get this working smoothly from now until I leave.",US

It works the way it’s supposed to & have even managed to watch tv programs not available in our country using Nord. The only thing that I sometimes get a problem with is, it stops my phone from working. When it 1st happened, I thought my phone was broken but remembered my son had exactly the same problem with a different but ‘free’ VPN that happened a hell of a lot more often than Nord. My husband eventually made him delete, thinking it wasn’t safe. It’s very rare for it to happen with Nord but when it does Safari, games, anything Wi-Fi related doesn’t work. I turn the NordVPN off & everything starts working straight away & can turn the VPN back on without any problems. I know this isn’t just a Nord problem, it must be a VPN problem. Nord has given me loads of perks that I’m very thankful for BUT I’m tech illiterate & made a mess with the Nord password protection as I already use Apple keychain. I know I’ve been given more perks but haven’t looked into them properly yet, I’m sorry. I’ve given Nord 5 stars because Nord is a great App, I don’t have to do anything except pick a location & everything else is done for me.  I can’t blame Nord for a bug that I know has happened to other VPN’s.  Thank you to whoever has to read this (🤞 you’re not a bot)I’m sorry for such a long message.

They don't code their own but rather use MS code so if you don't have an updated machine you're on your own to configure the VPN settings which aren't for the faint of heart.  I've had broken adapter settings for a month thanks to Nord's suggestion of using OpenVPN.  I really wish I had went with someone else. Update:  One person's complaint isn't going to fix your app built on MS subroutines that aren't available on older systems.  If you do manage to solve my problem that isn't going to change the fact that your customer service is horrible.  Also note worthy is that you run a reddit board that you won't let a lot of people post to, which further shows you don't care about good customer service.",US

5475,nordvpn.com,2022-05-17T20:44:14.000Z,5,What you need to know about NordVPN support as a Linux user...,"The other day I was trying to connect to my NordVPN account on my Linux system. The connection instead of flat out failing, simply froze in a loop of trying to connect. As a content creator I depend on NordVPN for my privacy. So by this point I am starting to get worried, my stream could be delayed because of this. After trying everything I could think to do, I went to NordVPN for help. The first support agent I worked with was Larry. At first I did not know what to expect. But as Larry worked I was beyond impressed, I thought to myself, man they actually hired an expert for this job! Eventually I needed to reset my system for support reasons, so I lost contact with Larry. The next expert I dealt with was Ezekiel. Ezekiel continued where I left off with Larry, and soon my situation was solved. I was actually amazed, going into this I did not expect the level of support I received. Both Larry and Ezekiel were polite, patient, and knowledgable. 5 star support in my experience. In writing this review, I initially had forgotten Larry's name. I thought I would miss the change to mention him. But then, I went back to support and worked with Luna. I asked if about the names of the representatives I spoke with recently, and her response was just what I needed. AGENT (Luna): As I can see you chatted with Ezekiel and Larry. :)  My entire support experience was a pleasure. Something that I find rare in my general experience... If you use Linux, do not hesitate to use NordVPN as your VPN of choice!",US

After using for a week or so after subscribing I didn't use the service at all for the remainder of my month. Around 2 days after auto renewal I realised that my credit card had been charged for another month. I immediately contacted NordVPN customer services explaining the situation and requesting a refund in the interests of customer goodwill but, unlike other service providers who also have an auto renewal policy, they were completely unwilling to refund. I checked the sign-in process again and the auto-renewal language was in very small font and at the very end of the sign-up process, so extremely easy to miss. Based on this experience would not use NordVPN or recommend it further, which is unfortunate as the service itself was reasonable but not super reliable and there are plenty of highly-rated competitors in the space who I would rather consider next time around.",CH

The few issues I faced happened because some sites don't work well when you're connected to a VPN but you usually find a way around it. The only thing I regret is that NordVPN is advertised for watching shows unavailable in your coutry, which is possible but limited for example with Netflix. The platform detects pretty easily your VPN connection and blocks you. Another important thing is that many shows (especially anime) are not dubbed nor subtitled in english so if you're not a native speaking Japanese for example, it's apmost no use to use the Japanese Netflix! After the year or so that I spent using NordVPN, I would say it's worth using especially for the price you pay with their many offers!",CH

And since it's been so long time ago they wont do anything. While it might be technically legal, it's a super shady business model to get people to sign up and hope they get stuck. There has been no willingness to return any money or compensate me in any way. I can confirm what many others here have experienced and warn you to keep away from this company. It's such a shame for a company otherwise seemingly delivering a fine product.  Do not support this greediness.",DK

My console only would allow me to use the VPN service only through a PC which I did not own. I had a VPN on my phone already provided by my wireless carrier so I couldn't use NordVPN and ask for a refund the very next day. They followed up with a very nice and respectful email asking me to explore any and all of my devices but sadly I did not and after the trial period ended they sadly but respectfully refunded my purchase price. During that trial period they offered many options and suggestions to keep my subscription active and seeing their commitment to satisfy a new customer really made me wish I had more devices on hand just to keep my account active because I knew they were committed to providing good service and honest feedback. Usually an internet company won't honor a ""money back guarantee""; but NordVPN does, and did for me. If there service is as half as good as their integrity is, then NordVPN must be the best VPN on the net. Sincerely,  John from Rock Hill, S.C.",US

It protects and is easy to use for beginners. I have used it for both Windows and Linux. On my computers, tablet and phone. All easy to set up and all easy to run. A word on Linux, because there are so many Distros, it could be a little much for someone who only uses GUI on Linux. You may have to use the Terminal window to run and activate/deactivate. If you're comfortable with that, then it works great. Also, as with some other VPN, you may have to deactivate it to get to some of your financial sites or bill paying sites. This has happened maybe 3% of the time for me. The simple timer option allows to stop it for a period of time you need and automatically will connect when the time is up. This has helped a lot. I have not had the need to use some of the additional features, but I can say that if they work as well as the main program, then it would be a great VPN for others.

Every time this has happened I immediately regret setting up an Authenticator and 2FA or MFA for an app. It's another mountain to climb in the adventure of accessing our digital lives through new technology when equipment and software are updated. With a damaged screen, it makes the process feel like an impossible feat.  I was really frustrated this last time but then I saw a chat bubble at the bottom right of my browser screen light up red. I begrudgingly clicked on it, fighting off the urge to figure this out on my own again.

Upon the unfortunate realisation I’d just paid for a year of access to something I don’t use I tried to get a refund, but as their support stated to me they simply don’t do this for renewals. Their website states they don’t offer refunds unless they’re legally required to do so. Beware. Edit: After some discussion they have kindly agreed to provide me with a refund, but I assume this is a fairly uncommon occurrence. Please be aware of the caveat around the refund policy, I would very much like to see it changed to not be so anti-consumer.",GB

6048,nordvpn.com,2022-05-07T11:59:05.000Z,3,Ive used u for yrs now and i enjoy ur…,"Ive used u for yrs now and i enjoy ur speeds and service so far but my time has come to an end now as i no longer trust ur service and i will look for another instead at least for now. My problem, and it should be everyones who care about their privacy, is that sometimes when i switch computers or it logs itself out, i get the startup box which wants a login to open the protocol to then enter the program itself. Because u cant even open and enter the program itself without this uhh?!? I use a kill switch obviously. I cant open the protocol without turning it off to login. the problem then is that it will ONLY open this protocol to enter and login on my default browser, i cannot choose ffs. I do NOT want to open my normal browser without a vpn on so all my tabs, history etc is then xposed, i mean w.t.f? I want to CHOOSE the browser, like tor in my case or any other, that doesnt have my stuff loaded for my provider and kill bates to see. This is the whole point of using a vpn no? I have tried to log in manually via tor , there is no dl option for the protocol that way, and reinstalling the program still force me to that damn startup page which will then ONLY let me login in via my default browser(tor cant be set to default) which then completely xposes everything i have open etc. This absolutely infuriates me and its a major flaw in ur design. You are taking away OUR choice to enter settings and the program itself just for this silly thing. Its a huge safety flaw and I no longer trust u tbh.  How hard is it to add a dl protocol link on a manual login or something like that?!? It defies ur whole purpose with this sheet come on. Also, what happened to ur front site, many small changes that just makes it worse and clunky now.  Its too hard to search for things. It keeps u logged in when i dont want it to and its set to not remember pw etc. Searching for the Linux command codes is near imposible, i always end up having to find them via a google search lol. Linux autoconnection guide is difficult to follow also because it says it varies from distro to distro and it uses this example. Ok then where is the example i need for my distro. Small things like this recently ive noticed, ur integrity has fallen, specially with this fecking login protocol thing that xposes ur privacy. You also basically steal money in a sneaky way. On autorenewal sometimes if there is no money on my account when its time to renew it will send u a mail saying it will keep trying for A FEW MORE DAYS. This is a LIE. It will keep trying for weeks ffs w.t.f? Sometimes I do NOT want to spend money on the vpn the the rest of that month for economic reasons and then I xpect it will stop trying to renew after those few days. Then i will put in money on my account to use for soemthing else, and in my case over a week later you just stole them and autorenewed. LOL? Change ur description to 'we will keep trying forever untill u cancel autorenewal' then, dont fecking lie? Ive really noticed a lot of these small details thats comes close to having more focus on commercial and cash grab than actual integrity and user control. And how hard is it to add a nordcpn button to home site once ur in account settings instead on ur webpage? Why do i have to go to search engine to type nordvpn to get bk to the start to see this or that, when it should be easy to do once ur in. Another small anoying detail! And i find is highly concerning u have added a google and appl connect link to ur page in account, its almost like u dont know who they are and why we use a vpn in the first place. Maybe ill return if wireguard etc prove to be worse, but i will cancel my sub for now.",DK

I don't know what they've done to their application in the last year, but it sucks now.  For reference, I'm using this on a mac, so hopefully the pc app isn't this bad. The app takes forever to connect, sometimes won't even open, throttles my connection immensely, and much more. Worst of all is that if it's having issues connecting, which it may not even tell me, then I can't use the internet at all. I thought something was wrong with my computer for a couple of days until I force quit the application and didn't open it again, as merely opening it, not even trying to connect, killed my internet connection.

Generally, it has worked, glitch-free as I've been traveling to different countries and using the VPN as needed. However, I am disappointed that it seems, as they've got you - a ""valued customer"" then the rates for usage have gone up rather drastically. I have written to ask why this is - and of course, there's no good reason other than to make more money. If a service can be offered for three years at a reasonable price, then surely a customer signing on again doesn't cause more issues for NORD or cost them any more to maintain the service, so WHY does the price go up so much. It leads me (and I'm sure others) to look for alternatives instead of sitting back and feeling that good old comfort of being served at a reasonable price for a good product. Now I feel as though I need to look elsewhere. Good service but now I feel a little exploited.",GB

She requested my router log file and a screen shot of the router settings provided page.  She asked me to allow her a few minutes to review.  She came back with the cause of the issue.  The server config file I was using went to a Nord server that inop.  I asked her if she could provide configure file for a Dallas server and with in a minute she posted both top and up files.  I loaded the top file and got the green check mark that I've been looking for.  Way to go Violet you're a Rock Star! When searching for server configuration files in the US. It would be nice to be able to drill down to city of choice. I also noticed that the help for Asus router VPN client is out of date.

6412,nordvpn.com,2022-04-29T21:40:19.000Z,5,Best VPN Service for everyone.,"There is no privacy online in this world at moment, there are hundreds of trackers who can track & profile each and every user online, across multiple websites. The time demands all internet users to change their online behavior and have little more discipline. VPN is one good example which prevents an average internet user to protect and prevent their internet address. This gives certain degree of protection, if not fully. As an computer engineer, I have tried multiple VPN services and from last three years, I am with NordVPN. They are simply the best among other competitors, because of their overall coverage around multiple countries.  With some help from their engineer, I was able to flash my router to have online security for entire house. I will advise every internet user to use a VPN and will highly recommend using NordVPN.",US
6413,nordvpn.com,2022-04-29T21:27:35.000Z,1,Just discovered that my location was exposed for 5.5 years!,"I've been with Nord for 5.5 years, and have always been extremely happy with the service. I chose it because it officially supported the openvpn client, provided many servers in many countries, it was honest, trustworthy, reliable, competent, and had a ""no logs"" policy. That all changed recently when I realised (and proved) that they had added advice to their configuration documentation since I joined that tells customers to disable ipv6, but didn't inform me about it. When I tested for leaks, I was shocked to find that my location was exposed for all those years, completely undermining the reason that I had subscribed to the service. The idea that every single customer who uses openvpn should disable important core functionality just for the relatively small amount of time connected to Nord, just because Nord can't cope, is ridiculous. It's prone to customers missing it, even if they were informed by the docs. It's a sledgehammer of a workaround; a bit like improving the safety of a car that has faulty brakes by removing the engine.  When I contacted support, the advice was that, if I wanted to keep ipv6 enabled, I should use their 4 (out of 5500!) servers that support ipv6. That's a minuscule fraction of the service I pay for. To maintain my service, apparently, I'd have to contact support periodically to find out if the number of ipv6 servers had increased, or if the existing ones have been decommissioned. This would clearly create a really poor customer experience. I offered a range of possible solutions that would improve the situation and increase customer safety but, after 2 weeks / 30 emails, I haven't received a single message that shows they understand my issues (not strictly only the ipv6 issue), and they haven't been interested in how I would be satisfied going forward. I've asked politely countless times that my case be escalated to a senior manager who has the authority to make changes to their approach, but they refuse, but also fail to make any progress whatsoever. If they reply to this review here, then it just proves how little they care about their customers' perspective, because I obviously can't respond. One of my main issues now is that they refuse to have a constructive, productive conversation where my views are acknowledged, or ideas considered.

I NEVER received warning that they would charge my account WEEKS in advance of the expiration of my account.  And I was NEVER informed that I had signed on to a recurring charge.  I purchased a three-year plan that I paid for all at once.  I haven't been charged a dime for THREE YEARS, then suddenly you take $100 from my account without warning.  You should feel nothing but shame. ORIGINAL REVIEW: Their billing policies are a scam.  They don't clearly state that customers are automatically opted-in to an extension of their service.  Then they charge you weeks in advance of your account's expiration and without any warning.  Consequence: they take your money before you even have a chance to cancel your account.  DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THIS FRAUDULENT SERVICE!  If this is what they do with your money, then what are they doing to your privacy?",US

I spoke with Jeff from NordVPN's Customer Success team today, regarding adding a NordLocker plan to the NordVPN and NordPass Premium 2 year bundle. It was one of my best customer service experiences to date, with any company. This whole world of VPN and all the associated terminology is new to me, and Jeff was incredibly patient and I came out of our chat with a much better understanding of what this is all about.  I highlight the following because Jeff went above and beyond. There were 2 very specific questions that had to do with outside companies/cloud storage that weren’t answered. Jeff immediately assured me someone would reach out to me with more detailed information about those topics. I mention the two unanswered questions because in and of itself, his handling of the situation is one of the reasons why this was such an excellent encounter with a member of the Customer Success team. In between and after those questions, Jeff was incredibly attentive and ensured that he a) answered every single one of my questions with care, b) forwarded my questions to the appropriate departments, c) stayed with me for the remainder of my questions and helped me better understand what I’m dealing with, and d) offered excellent resources for me to review so I can be better informed moving forward. Jeff also sent me a link to the NordLocker premium plan page, where I was able to see a breakdown of the different NordLocker storage tiers/pricing, which is a great start so I am able to be better informed when I am contacted by email from someone else within the NordVPN/Pass/Locker community.   He also made sure to ask if I had any other questions before we ended the chat. NordVPN, NordLocker - what an INCREDIBLE employee you have with Jeff. I’ve been in customer service/customer care for over 10 years as both a representative/agent, and management within such departments, and wow! He deserves the very best and I hope NordLocker knows how lucky they are to have Jeff as a part of their Customer Care team.

It worked 'so-so' on my laptop and phone - basically ok, but sometimes i've had issues with connectivity. 3 months after the purchase it suddenly stopped working without any reason - on all my devices. I contacted the support team via chat - despite the supporters try their best - it's a shame that there's no possibility to contact via phone/skype/teams nowadays to discuss more complex issue like I had. It turned out that there was something ""wrong with my account. The app would not connect to any server on any device. The windows issue was fixed after 2 days since submitting it. The phone - still unresolved - and won't be, as the support team simply does not know when the Android 12 update will fix it - basically the app does not react on tapping log in/sign in buttons - the internet browser does not appear, so i cannot enter my credentials. This means I cannot use the app at all (over 2 weeks now), I am not entitled to any refund due to the policy - which is disappointing - why I have to pay for a software I cannot use? Android has been available for many weeks already and the app should be prepared and ready for it. I won't recommend the app to anyone in our company, we were thinking of extending the services to the password manager too, but now we do not want to risk a situation, it would suddenly stop working on certain software.

So basically I just lost 100$ for nothing - NordVPN won't issue a refund to my other card or a bitcoin wallet and NordVPN still functions very poorly in Russia Advise to others - don't buy a 2 year subscription before testing a tool for a short period of time.  I really thought that such a big company as NordVPN could issue a refund especially since they can see that I didn't used there service successfully even once.,RU

I'd stopped the auto renew, and my credit card had expired, so I had to set up the new card details. Then I had to turn on the auto renew. Then I found I'd been billed twice. Got onto the chat and seemed to get a refund sorted. The following day I noticed I'd been charged again, and my contract expires in 6 years! Not what I wanted!! Been trying to log into their chat for 3 hours, and no one available.  Raised another ticket, and hope I can get this resolved. Update: Did get a swift response from Facebook messenger, assured me they'd arrange a second refund and cancelled the auto renew. 40 min later still no change in the website billing info; I'll see what happens tomorrow. Update: 3 debits and exchange fees take, and finally 2 have been refunded with the fees.  Seems the best way to get a result is via Facebook Messenger!",GB

Support refused to help or refund during the 30 days dispite several requests and now just say ""you only have one account"".. No help why its corrupt EVER SINCE they ""merged"" the accounts..

They pointed me in the right direction as I had set it up in my Ubiquiti router and it was only performing at 19Mpbs where as my actual connection speed was just short of 1Tbps.  It appears that most SOHO (Small office/Home Office) routers only have 32Bit (X86) CPU's installed and this limits the ability for applications to use the multi threading capability's that 64bit CPU's offer. This limited my speed drastically. After many hours of research, I hand built my own high performance router with some old PC parts and an I5 8 core CPU using OPN-Sense (opensource) routing software built on the good old trusted FreeBSD (Unix Derivative) software. This ended up giving me with NORD VPN enabled and configured... 500Mbps, which is a 3500% increase in performance. I am absolutely BUZZED and it has never dropped a session to date!",NZ

Although it's not at seamless as having no VPN on at all when it comes to loading web pages or downloading things, no VPN is, though to it's credit the throughput speeds are still very high, only losing maybe ~10% overall download speed. The servers connect quickly, and the flexibility with the phone app and otherwise are nice features. They didn't have any NordPass or anything like that when I initially purchased it, and although I wouldn't pay the extra to get it now, I still think it's very important to offer, and I would use it if it were included in the price.

Best Regards, Ambrosio Pedrosa Customer Success Team NordVPN.com It's been almost two years now. They just kept your money and no refund. I contacted the support today, April 15 2022. Here is selection of the chat history: AGENT (Mason): Hey!  AGENT (Mason):   USER: could you please send the latest connection method for China users?  AGENT (Mason): What device are you using?  USER: windows  AGENT (Mason): We are currently experiencing some issues with the Windows application, but are already working on new servers to help our customers connecting from China. Unfortunately, now we do not have an estimated time on how long will it take to resolve this issue. Any updates will be posted here: [ the Iink is deleted as TrustPilot does not allow links in review] We apologize for the inconvenience and your patience is greatly appreciated.  USER: there have been two years since I was unable to connect via Nord  AGENT (Mason): I apologize for the inconvenienc,  AGENT (Mason): Inconvenience.*  USER: what is the difference between fraud and what Nord is doing?  AGENT (Manfred): At the moment there is not much we can do regarding the Windows app.  USER: two years   USER: that is not what you had advertised when I signed up  USER: do feel like a fraud to me  AGENT (Manfred): Give me a moment.  AGENT (Manfred): As mentioned in the Terms of Service -  ""Our website, products, and services may be unavailable from time to time due to human, digital, mechanical, telecommunication, software, and other failures. We cannot predict or control when such downtime may occur and cannot control the duration of such downtime.""  USER: you call ""two years"" from time to time?  AGENT (Manfred): The connection highly depends on the ISP as well.  USER: that's not a decent corporation should behave. Your service is to get customers pass internet restriction regardless of countries. if you can't do, you should refund their money. Coming up with excuses like ""working hard on a solution"" for almost two years is beyond any decent human excuse. It may be forgivable if its a few months. Look at your competitor Express, they have came up with a new protocol. If you can't do that, you shouldn't advertise it worked. As of right now, you still advertise your service work in China on windows, that is fraudulent advertising. Not a decent corporation should behave. And you should not work for such a company that cheat people and keep coming up with excuses.   AGENT (Manfred): The Windows application should have worked for our customers before the recent issue. There is not much we can do when it comes to these restrictions.  AGENT (Manfred): If all of our servers are being blocked by the ISP at the moment, then I can't do much at the moment.  Do NOT purchase Nord service if you are a user in China.",HK

7331,nordvpn.com,2022-04-12T01:40:04.000Z,2,Poor Customer Service.,"I got an email in January that came across as a renewal notice for my service contract and paid it.  I knew it was due in the New Year but being ill with COVID and a bad fall I just paid it and then got another renewal notice in March.  Having been ill with what turned out to be an ongoing concussion from the fall I pd it but in the back of my mind I thought I had pd it.  So I logged in and checked my bank and NordVPM acct and found I had paid in January and March.  You can't call them you can only communicate on line which is a lengthy matter when you have an idiot on the other end who can't understand what you are telling them.  I loaded the bank and the Nord VPN acct details showing I had paid twice.  After a lengthy back and forth typing of messages I finally thought she understood as she said she would cancel both payments,  I have it in writing and she agreed not to cancel my Nord protection until I had paid a new renewal.  Why I had to have both cancelled I didn't know but after a frustrating conversation it was agreed she would cancel both payments and I would renew once the refund came thru.  Firstly my Nord protection was removed and when I checked my bank acct the only refund I had was from the March pmt.  So I contacted them again.  The person I spoke to read the history of the last chat and said the January pmt was for a special Nord service I have NEVER used.  I still don't understand what it is for.  I just wanted basic coverage I am a pensioner who uses the net to shop online and stay in contact with family.  The person I spoke to said if I had cancelled the first pmt within 30 days I would have gotten a refund but it was past that and he could do nothing about it.  If I wanted protection I had to pay again.  He would not respond to the mistakes made by the customer service person in the first message.  It was obvious she just said what she said to get rid of me.  And the next person was not helpful either.  Nord fix your customer service problem because only being able to contact online is not good enough,  If your staff make a mistake as the first person did you should wear their mistake and not make your customer's so freaking angry because I know I was lied too.   Plus your marketing tactics are bordering on fraud.  That first email was made to look like it was a renewal notice for service.  How can you have a renewal notice for a program you have never used or pay for?  I have warned my friends not to use Nord because of the lack of customer service.",AU
