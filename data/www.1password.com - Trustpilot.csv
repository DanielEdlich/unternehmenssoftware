I've been with 1Password for years, in-fact after nine years of using it, I can personally attest to its reliability and convenience. For me personally, this tool has been amazing. I have passwords for dozens of online accounts, each with different lengths and characters, (most are over 25 characters with numbers and symbols thrown in) and 1Password makes managing them a breeze. With a single click, it fills in forms and remembers my credentials, so I don't have to. It also offers top-notch security features, such as regional lockout and two-factor authentication, so I can rest assured that my data is safe. On top of that, 1Password is incredibly user-friendly. I can audit my credentials easily and weed out duplicate login info and remove sites I don't use. I can quickly generate strong passwords and store them in an encrypted database. Plus, the intuitive setup makes it easy to get started. In short, 1Password is an indispensable tool for anyone who wants to keep their online accounts safe. Whether you're setting up your accounts for the first time or have dozens of logins to manage, 1Password is the perfect solution. No more stress and worry about security, just get it and forget about it. I highly recommend 1Password and will continue to be a loyal customer for the 10th year and beyond.",GB

There is a workaround and they are aware of the issue, but I took a star away because after searching for a solution I found it's been out there for 3 months so far without a fix yet.

I'm also looking for a clear description of where the database resides (that was the issue with LastPass - the databases were hacked and stolen) and I'd prefer to self-manage that aspect.

Over the course of about month I queried the support folks with numerous questions to help me make this decision and always received a helpful response.  When I finally made the decision to move to version 8 I had a thread of 23 separate inquiries to the support group.  They were very patient.  I would have rated the experience as a 5, but I did struggle some following the online migration instructions and the support team response to some of my questions about the instructions.  Another possible opportunity for improvement would be to assign a case to one team member.  I probably communicated with a half dozen different support team members within the 23 email thread.  Finally, even though email is a great tool, I think a phone call, particularly during the migration process would have saved time and frustration.  I've only had version 8 for a day, so I can't comment yet on whether this has been a good decision, but I am delighted with now being able to open my vault with a touch of my finger.

Every time I reach out to 1Password either for a tech issue or a billing question, they are on the spot with a response and a helpful resolution. This last time I reached out asking about why I incurred a foreign transaction fee on my credit card for my annual family subscription. Not only did they help with the matter they even gave me a $5.00 credit until I figure out a better credit card to use for my annual billing. They are in Canada and I live in the USA. I began using their software for my Mac and paid for the software upfront. I then began using the App on my iPhone and iPad and paid for those initial installations. Eventually, I went to the Family subscription plan and I have not regretted the decision. The only suggestion I would like to make is to make it possible to sync with my iCloud account alongside of syncing onto 1Password's encrypted servers. At the present, I use 1Password 7 on my iOS devices for that reason and use 1Password 8 on my Mac OS devices--MacBook Pro and MacStudio. I plan to stay with 1Password for as long as I can envision, even as I begin incorporating Passkeys into my online security. Having a double layer of Passkeys baked into my keychain as well as 1Password security on their servers is the best kind of protection going forward. Thanks 1Password for your vigilant attention to security and for the best kind of customer service out there--the kind that answers email almost immediately and resolves the problems or questions with specific attention. Thanks 1Password. You have gained a customer for life!",US

Successive updates have removed features, some large (like local vaults), some small.  On Mac, I've had to reinstall the app twice in the past week after updates render it ""unable to be opened"". The new JavaScript-only browser extension now takes ~20 seconds to unlock every time I'm asked for my master password; the classic extension which communicated with the desktop app was instant. It used to be a native macOS app, and felt like one. Now feels like any other website pretending to be an app, but at least all the platforms are now at parity. To be fair, this change is an upgrade for those who mostly use the app on Windows, but it's a shame we had to lose one of the better native Mac apps in the name of easier cross-platform support.

Most of the ones I've used are pretty slow & you hardly ever talk to a real person. For a pretty minor amount for all the security we gain,  1Password's support was excellent. We recently subscribed to 1Password on a Black Friday discount of -25%. We were still in the 14-day trial period, but thought to go ahead & lock in the pricing by adding our billing information.

I've had 1password for exactly a year now, and the only reason I got it was because my passwords were stolen from my Google account.  Pros: Since the day I subscribed to it, and that's pretty good money for a private person like me, I haven't had a single problem, either logging in or registering, and not a single password has been stolen.  The software on Windows is excellent with no bugs. It serves its purpose wonderfully, and so far I have not found a single difficulty.  The support service is unparalleled, especially the chat feature, which I appreciate so much with companies as it makes it easy to get a quick response. I thank the staff from the bottom of my heart. Cons: It's a different story on Android, but I don't work with the phone much. The autofill function sometimes works to not at all. This only happened when I did the new (big) update.  Conclusion: I recommend anyone who values their accounts and is on the internet a lot, opens a lot of accounts, to buy 1password. It is definitely worth it!

Seriously, I'm not kidding. I contacted them because I had some issue trying to setup a subscription account. Customer Services noticed that I had bought a full licence back in 2011 when I was still using a Mac and even though I'm now on Linux they offered to trade in my old licence towards a new subscription account with a generous ""first 2 years free"" in exchange. That is mind blowing! 🤯 A 12 year old licence and they offered to exchange it! No other company would dream of doing that.  They sent me all the links to setup the account and I got up and running in mere minutes.  And each staff member was super friendly, polite and took the action needed to make it an awesome experience. I've tried other password managers simply because after moving to Linux at the time 1password wasn't available there but now it's available on Linux (as well as literally every other OS out there) I'm SO HAPPY to be using it again.

I checked my GMail history, spam folder...nothing. The first I had ever seen of their initial response was in this follow-up. So apparently their system registered this email as sent, but it wasn't.

With this, I have been posing many questions to each vendor's support team. From the various support teams I have contacted, my experience with the 1Password support team from October 30 to November 9 has been the best for a few reasons: 1. The replies I got made it clear the 1Password support team read and understood my questions, and replied accordingly. For the other vendors I have contacted, I often have to repeat the question a few different ways to sometimes get a useful response. 2. The 1Password support team is knowledgeable and offers good information. For the other vendors, I didn't feel they had a good/deep understanding of their software and hence couldn't provide quality answers. 3. The 1Password support team is empathetic and genuinely seems to care. I also find the 1Password UI to be the best of the password managers I've looked at, and I appreciate that they offer and continue to invest in a desktop application (since some no longer offer one, or no longer offer new features in it).  There are a few features that are not directly available in 1Password but they have workarounds and solutions for that ended up working better for me (digital inheritance is an example), and there is still one major feature I am waiting on before I consider switching over since I'm very used to it from my existing password manager (the auto submit feature).

For example, when I am instructed to do something about an extension, I really did not understand what extensions really were.  It also turns  out that there can be both Safari and Chrome extensions., and I'm sure others as well.  Instructions often resulted in me consulting Google for various definitions. The result was a fairly lengthy process of email exchanges between Josh and me.  I have to think he was becoming as frustrated with the experience as was I. However. Josh did not quit, so I decided I wouldn't quit as long as he would put up with me.

584,www.1password.com,2022-10-31T17:11:59.000Z,1,Disaster Software,"I am no fool and computer literate however even though I have a top of the range iMac this software has eaten up 10 full days trying to make it work. In Safari it just doesn't work and the extension is rated as 2 Stars.  I would rate it Zero. It seems to work 100% of the time on Firefox   95% of the time on Chrome.   80% of the time on Androids. Pretty pathetic really for software in 2022.  If this was intended to save me time and improve my security it has had the complete opposite effect.  Once you turn on a password manager you have to turn off the browser autofills (makes sense) however you are now completely reliant on 1password to do what it says on the tin.  When it doesn't you are left with complex passwords that you have no chance of typing in. This software has destroyed my sanity, the support is zero, no chat, no telephone just email 12 to 24 hour responses your 14 day trial soon gets used up and your headache tablets as well. I can only surmise the 5 star reviews are coming from users of Firefox unfortunately I use Safari and Chrome. I am only hoping all traces of this unfortunate episode experience can be removed from my iMac and I can get back to normal. UPDATE following this review I was contacted by 1password and provided my contact details, following that I was contacted at 730am on Sunday by their expert on browsers and gave all the information that they requested.  I am very impressed with the speed of their response and on a Sunday. Its Monday night now and no feedback yet but I am hopeful, Updates to follow",GB

Click on the app and it would not start.... gave me a message that I had previously installed a later version.  Previously I had updated from version 7 to 8, maybe there was some trash in my front yard ""so to speak"".  Tommy tried the usual fixes.... but I was unable to even fire up the application.  He resorted to investigating within the finder application folder.... and we drilled down into the basement to find the files-logs etc needed for the troubleshooting process.  Finally the fix was to delete the data file and let the program reset itself....brilliant.   First off I was impatient and Tommy kept his cool.... no worries.

And having the passwords after face and fingerprint is really taxing for some, the bot reading this agrees with me, lol.

882,www.1password.com,2022-09-09T07:01:21.000Z,5,An offer I couldn't refuse.,"As a long term user of Lastpass and experiencing some annoying inconveniences which were clearly not being addressed, I read some password manager reviews; 1password was highest recommend, and the mose expensive, as I recall. I decided to opt for a 14 day trial, which for me, a busy, old, grumpy, arthritic and technically  imcompitent creature,  proved insufficient time to attain an adequate degree of confidence to switch from a long term and proven operational system which I knew well how to operate. When I explained this to 1Password's Ms Julia V., they apparently had no hesitation in extending the trial period to about 4 (four) months; I found this to be most surprising,  understanding and professional. Within about 3 or 4 weeks I had attained a sufficient level of confidence with 1Password the make the switchover with ease and conviction. When I informed the 1Password people that I was ready to switch and pay without delay, they graciously maintained the full feeless trial period. Further, as I opted for a 'family' plan because that choice sat comfortably with me, I asked weather or not the 1Password people would agree to me inviting a friend to have a trial period (of unspecified length) as one of my 'family' members, obviously isolated from my information with his own 'personal' vault and benefits. They agreed enthusiastically and immediately. This demonstrates a great company attitude and it enthuses me with confidence which is reflected in their product. It is also a face saver for me as I had tried my password-frustrated friend to try Lastpass; oh how I continue to regret that. A path to redemption has been provided by 1Password. Full marks to 1Password, Julia V, and, of course, the complete management of 1 Password. Sincerely, Peter Kelly.",AU

Introduced through work, I've since gone on to pay for a family plan in the vain hope that my wife would find it as convenient as I do. Nope, she just resets her password 57 times a month. The struggle goes on. 1Password 8 is taking a little getting used to but I can see what they are going for and each release gets more polished.  I've enjoyed the availability of PC OS, Mobile OS and web extensions as I tend to use all of these. At work, I'm on a Mac. At home, I use Linux and Windows. I own Android and IOS devices. And all of these get 1password set up as the first thing I do. After doing that, getting into my various accounts is a breeze. I also make use of the automatic 2fa completion and have added a security key to my master account.  I use watchtower to keep an eye on what accounts have been compromised over time and allow the software to help with resetting my passwords. Finally, I submitted a bug and a few questions to the friendly Customer Support team and received great service, with thorough instructions and guidance.

Over a period of several days I went back and forth with several support staff who I must say were steady and persistent in solving my problem. It turned out that I had an old email address no longer in use on my account and it was causing problems with updating to the latest 1Password version. Support staff were always very prompt in getting back to me with instructions as to what I had to do each step of the way to correct this. Trevor, the last in my series of support people, was particularly helpful. His instructions were so clear and easy to follow and he always made it clear that I should be sure to contact him if I had problems or questions on moving forward, which I did several times, and his response was immediate and effective in completely resolving my problem.",US

The person on the support team replies with a bunch of irrelevant questions, depite me having explained in the opening phase the full software scenario leading to the failed move. I they reply to explain again the scenario and look to be assisted (lets remember paid subscription), and all that happens is to be ghosted. No reply ever since, despite me having written multiple times to the support trying to get assistance. Now 6th Sept 2022 and counting, still stuck with un-usable software, subscription was debited to my card and no reply from support.

But after I actually tried this app for 14 days, I know i cant leave it right now. Here's why: 1. More organized than chrome     When i use chrome, sometimes it will repeatedly remember my account and username, then afterwards, if i want to login the next time, i will pop up multiple choices which looks a mess. 2. More secure than chrome    As far as i know, chrome do very little encryption on the password, leaving *all* of your password in a ricky situation, and recently one of my ""main password"" leaked, not knowing who to blame... 3. Cross platform, Cross app (really important)    When i use chrome, it always suggests me to use a auto-generated password, but then i think what the hell am i going to do when i want to type this password in a iphone app? But 1password has no similar problem, it support not only all the web browser but also all the apps in ios, android, mac, windows... 4. Its not that expensive (especially if you're a student)     At first glance it seems 3$ each month is quite expensive, but hey this is our password, this is out privacy, it's worthless! And also if you're a student you can write an email to the support team and they will give you a 50% discount, and now this is really cheap!

Over the past 10 years, I had nothing but good things to say about 1Password, but I recently upgraded my Mac operating system to Monterey which no longer supported the old 1Password 6 version, so I figured I would take the plunge and upgrade. I tried to update to 1password 8 directly, but discovered I could not do so, I was instructed to install 1Password 7 to facilitate the upgrade to 1Password 8, but after following the instructions, I still was not able to 1Password 8.  I decided to try running 1Password 7 instead, but kept getting NUMEROUS annoying pop ups to upgrade to 1password 8 every time I used it, and I could not add or edit new passwords. Unfortunately my original version of 1Password was purchased many years ago under an email address I no longer had access to, and it did not have the “Secret Key”. I tried following the tech support information on their website, but the instructions did not help at all. The nagging reminders and inability to update my passwords or add new ones became more and more frustrating. I tried emailing asking to speak with a tech rep, but was told they do not offer phone support. I was provided more lists of tech support steps, but they did not work. I have made the unhappy decision to part ways with 1Password.  It used to be a fantastic password manager, but the current version is inaccessible to users of previous versions and your tech support is pathetic. I find it incomprehensible they cannot offer phone support for long term paying customers that are willing to pay $36/year to get the new version. I have seen this kind of behavior when small companies go VC funding. I can only deduce their customers are a secondary consideration to short term bottom line profit. Signed,  A customer lost.",US

I expected the bug report to fall into the ether. Instead, Dave W. from 1Password Support captured my disparate bug reports / feedback submissions into one uber-case and responded to each numbered item with an explanation or ask for further details. Over the course of a week, we corresponded back and forth with clarifying questions and debugging information / repro steps. Throughout this process, I felt that Dave was highly invested in my success as a 1Password customer and highly invested in the quality of his company's workmanship, reputation, and customer engagement. Dave also gave me very technical explanations and advice, which helped me eliminate potential root causes and figure out some mitigations on my end as well. I've been in the tech industry for 8 years now, including 7 years working in the security space (5 years on AI/policy/law/UX to fight social engineering, 2 years on OAuth protocols and cryptography), and having spent my time at Microsoft and Google I've mostly acted in the capacity as the customer service PROVIDER, so I do have some empathy for how difficult the job is. However, I've also had my fair share of being a customer or a partner. From all three of those perspectives - as I already told Dave in the customer support email at the end of our thread - Dave W. provided the best 1:1 hands-on customer support I have ever experienced either as a consumer or enterprise customer. While I've always had a high opinion of 1Password and I am definitely a superuser, Dave's customer support far exceeded any of my expectations.",US

1001,www.1password.com,2022-08-23T14:27:29.000Z,1,Adding passwords is not optimal,"Adding passwords is not optimal. Unlike other password managers, 1password does not prompt you to save or update your password after a succesful login. Rather, it asks you to save it before you click ‘ok’ or ‘submit’. This pulls you away from whatever task you were trying to accomplish. It is especially cumbersome when you are unsure what you password is. Horribly overlooked usability. I have 11 months left on a family plan, that I’m pretty much going to abandone over this oversight. You’re better off going with Lastpass which has this feature. EDIT: To answer your reply. Suggested passwords are for when I am CREATING a password, not to save an existing one. It does not address my concern at all. If you are going to reply to my review please read what I actually wrote. EDIT2: I've seen all your steps. I know how to use your software. You're not listening, it's not that I don't know how to do it, it's that your method is cumbersome and unintuitive. All the alternative software does it better. I think the fact that you don't see this problem (even though it has been discussed on your own forums and elsewhere) shows you do not listen to your customers.  There is a better way to add passwords than having to go in your interface and follow all those steps.  As soon as I successfully log into a website there should be a prompts that says ""Would you like to update/save this password?"" and then I click ""YES"" and it's done.  This is how Chrome's password manager does it, this is how Lastpass does it, This is how Bitwarden does it, etc. Your method is not good, there are better ways to do it. Assuming that my problem is that I don't know how to use your software seems arrogant.",US

Does a flag offer a higher pay? More benefits? Better insurance? Better work environment? Putting a flag is pure and plain virtue signaling by a company whose management has been taken over with woke madness. What's next? A flag showing ""support"" for ""Latinx"" ?

I trust it and I rely on it for my internet security. It allows me to store all kinds of sensitive information in a highly accessible but hack-resistant database. It allows me to enter a username and a unique high-strength password for every website I frequent. In many cases, it does that for me. All I have to do Is click on the URL: 1Password does the rest. (Why this procedure works better on some sites than others, I don’t know.) I can get to my library of information from any computer or other device any time I need to.  I do have one request: 1Password stores my sensitive information in a number of different “categories”: log-ins, credit card numbers, and so on. I often wish it were possible to convert an item in one category to an item in another, but the only way to do this is to create a new item (in the desired category), cut and paste the old information into it, and then delete the old item. Laborious, but I suppose there’s a good reason for this limitation.",US

I had a licence for a standalone version of the app and thought that was the only way of having 1Password, but learned recently there's a subscription version. I don't like subscriptions; I'd rather own an app than rent it; I turn away from subscription apps because I wouldn't get as much use out of them to be worth a monthly fee. For this reason, and because, as an owner of the standalone version, I was deprived of the benefits of the subscription version, I was starting to look elsewhere. In an exchange of emails with a chap at 1Password, I realised I use 1Password every day, probably more than I notice, as it's very convenient and so well integrated in iOS and macOS. This, and my belief that it is still the best password manager there is, persuaded me the subscription is worth it, indeed cheap for all the use I get out the app. Moreover, the subscription is charged annually, which is better than more frequent monthly charges. I was offered a surprisingly good inducement to continue with 1Password with an account rather than with a licence for a standalone version. The process of switching from the licensed version to the subscription version was smooth, well explained and straightforward. I've used their customer services only twice in eleven years and it was beneficial and satisfying both times. It's an excellent app at a bargain and the customer service is to be envied by other companies.",GB

I use it on my desktop PC, laptop PC, iPhone, and an iPad. It syncs passwords across all these devices in an instant.  The thing that I like about 1Password is that it can be set up to use a PIN for opening the application on either a windows or apple device. It is very easy to open and use.  But when any devices are shut off, it will require the master password and then use the PIN until the next reboot. This makes it more secure.  I like the watchtower function that tells me when my passwords are weak or repeated.  I still have to strengthen some passwords.   The beauty of having a Password manager is that I don’t have to make up easy to remember passwords.  I can make them long and complex (or use a suggested password) because 1Password handles all the passwords for me. The one installation issue that I ran into was that I was already using an older free limited version of 1Password on my iPad and IPhone. When I installed the new version onto all my devices, the passwords would not sync on the iPhone or IPad.  This was very frustrating.  I tried everything.  Then I contacted customer support. They responded via email within two days (over the 4th of July). They explained the issue and how to resolve it.  I worked perfectly.  Other than that, installation was easy.

Today, it's about support for the product.  Here's the scoop.  After many years of bailing out my husband, son etc. when they get themselves locked out of some account I thought why am I do this?  I set up a family account.  At some point my son told me he can't access it anymore, I assumed user error in setting up the account, put it on my list of things to resolve and life got in the way.  Many months later the annual fee came out and it prompted me to reach out.  Turns out I created two accounts and was paying for the one with no data in it.  No problem, I can help she says.  Hahaha.  I thought, what are the 18 hoops I need to jump through?  I will send some options she says and did.  Life gets in the way.  Weeks later I pick an option.  I will send instructions she says and did.  Life gets in the way.  Weeks later I read the email and see she did all the work in the background and all I had to do was follow the steps.  Clear steps.  There was not one point where I thought where is that? what does that mean? how do I access? what box do I click?  It's not about the ""template"".  Every email was personal and tailored to my individual situation.  I didn't know that still existed.  A product is a product but your people make the difference.  She could have asked what took so long, why didn't you pick an option, made assumptions that the delays were a choice but passed no judgement, just provided the support in a genuine and authentic way.  Kind is cool.  Bravo.",CA

Well, that was the dilemma a few days ago for me. 1Password works flawlessly, I have been trusting the company for a long time already, with their earliest versions. Having to remember just that one password you've etched into your soul is wonderful, the rest, you let the app make up, manage, even suggest or warn you to change some of.   A few days ago, I noticed I couldn't retrieve information under a specific part of 1Password, under the Documents category.  That's an odds & ends for me, I keep images, information saved as a snapshot, or scan, with gibberish that once in a while a specialized website might ask as a second factor authentication.   Trying on different devices I was having pretty much the same result getting somewhat worried thinking how could I retrieve the info and go on.  (It turns out that the integrity of the information was safe & sound in my vault, since I could download those files from 1Password.com - That's a big plus, proving peace of mind under a catastrophic scenario - that is if you remember what you etched into your soul of course) That's when Tech Support kicks in.  That's the serious business behind the big names.  Having worked for some fabulous companies, as tech support engineer, it's easy to understand all the effort that makes the solid bedrock of any company.  Selling a product, any product, is a first step in a business process.  Aftermarket is what keeps the product, the customers, and the manufacturers in a long lasting venture hopefully.  1Password definitely passed the test with my issue.  They asked me to do some tests, and they managed to easily pinpoint the problem, that turned out to be on my side, since I had some strict settings in my network that were preventing 1Password Manager to do it's magic. Problem solved, and everybody happy.  I'm glad this wasn't a software issue, thus reinforcing how solid their product has been through all the years I started using their product.

I let Kevin know as an ""FYI"".  Within another day, I received another email from him detailing additional investigations he had done into the issue, and some more thoughts on how to work around it.

Now, recently, for more safety and in estate planning if I become incapacitated and can't do my affairs myself, I was definitely advised to not use the free stand alone license and migrate over to 1Password.com with yearly membership. The help took a couple of days to get back about all the questions I had, but once that got started with the free trial to try, the emails continued back & forth, but always got more help with each one, all questions answered.

One drawback is that the licensing terms meant that we had to purchase two copies of the app (up through 1Password 7) to run on our two iMacs, we shared our passwords by synching the password database file through Dropbox.  This year I rather reluctantly decided to go with the subscription model and I bought a Family membership, and I started using the beta version of Password 8.  There were some glitches recently when I transitioned my wife to Password 8 and the shared Family membership (not the fault of 1Password itself).  This is now working quite well, though I am still not completely comfortable with the redesigned user interface.  The app is fast enough so that I am not particularly concerned with the way it is implemented (with some web technology underneath).  The shared and private vault scheme works well for us, with virtually all our password in the Family shared vault.  I wish that Apple would adopt a similar approach for shared Contacts, which are a bit of a pain to achieve using multiple Apple IDs.",US

If I knew I would had started by publishing my review here first, and then move to the support team. It took 2 days for support to answer my questions. On the third day I finally managed to access my account (eventhough my credit card info was accepted perfectly well from day one) So, in what world getting support 2 days later, for something as critical as a password manager, is a good service? You barely offer ways of resetting or recovering one's account, yet you take for 2 days to provide help?? Common, I'm glad the media managing branch is on top of everything, but I'm not looking for a media managing app. So, please spare me the whole act and focus on improving your support. [Original message] What a headache of an app. Stay away from this piece of crap. It is impossible to get support on the phone or even chat. If you loose your master password, you are in for a world or pain. It is impossible to recover your account if you loose your password or masterkey. Plus, the login is the crapiest ever, it doesn't work with other password managers (at least not my current one) because it has the extra field for the masterkey. Also, it doesn't allow you to see what password you are writing, so good luck finding out which letter you got wrong. It is a terrible service. I cancelled within the trial period, after spending 3 days trying to recover my account since I lost my password. Ugh, worse experience with software in a long time.

1535,www.1password.com,2022-06-09T19:14:15.000Z,5,The only Trustpilot review I shall ever write,"So there I was after eons (it felt like eons) using an Excel Spreadsheet for passwords and secret words and stuff I wanted to keep secret. And even though I love using spreadsheets; it was so cumbersome and unintuitive to use a spreadsheet sitting in the storage of my computer. I wasn’t able to use my list on my smartphone. Excel Online wasn’t a thing yet. Come to think of it, smartphones weren’t reallly that popular then. At least for me. I kept searching and trying out so many different password managers until I found 1Password. I can’t remember for how long I’ve been using it, but it must be close to all my adult life. Which is … a lot of years. I love that it syncs perfectly with my desktop and laptop computers, with my smartphone and with the smartphones of my family. I love the suggestions for passwords, the integration with browsers and the clean user interface. Come to think of it; I love everything about it. I share it with my family, I recommend it to my friends and colleagues. And if there is one subscription service that I will never stop using (and I use a few -> streaming services, you know), it’s 1Password. It just works. It helps me to be more productive and more secure throughout my day. Every. Single. Day. 1Password is the first app on my smartphone homescreen. It’s starting automatically when I turn on my computer. And it sits in my browser extensions waiting to be used. And used it will be. When I read the newsletters from the 1Password team I know that it is being made with love. It really shows that. So if you need a password manager; and believe me when I say: ‘You absolutely do need a password manager’. Look no further; don’t use a free password manager with fewer functions; and don’t settle for less. Just try 1Password and share it with your family.",AT

I use 1Password to collect my passwords and occasionally to create new ones. I don't often need 1Password to fill in a password. So, the pop-up window that appears whenever there is a form to be filled in is a bit annoying. First you have to login to 1Password and then you can fill in the form but I have often been distracted by the fact that Safari and 1Password compete with each other when there is something to be filled in.  I asked about this problem and thankfully got a simple solution: to disable the 1Password Safari extension. Still I wonder whether it wouldn't be possible to place the pop-up window somewhere else on the screen than next to the field that needs to be filled in. One more thing: I'd like a password generator that is accessible without having to login to 1Password",CH

Any question, any question no matter how big or small, simple or complex that you encounter in the process of using 1Password will be answered in detail and completely.  They respond to your emails on a daily basis, so it's not long after you submit your question that you'll get the answers you want in your inbox.  The email replies are also very cute and witty.  I think I will ask them about the food I should eat tomorrow.

I downloaded it, followed the easy and concise instructions and had it up and running in about 15 minutes.  The ""Emergency Kit"" is great, it has the secret key on it and a box for me to put my master password which the system created.   I had a few issues with signing in and synching the program with my browser.  I sent an email to customer support, and received a reply very quickly from ""Alex"" who asked me a few questions.  I told him what was happening and he  sent me details on how to go into the program and change a few settings, along with screen shots that showed me exactly what to look for.  He checked back with me to see if everything was working fine, and I appreciated his excellent customer service.

I definitely qualify as one of those frustrated “hangers on” to my old-form licenses.  However, within minutes of establishing my online account I was gaining new value with 1Password. I think the biggest surprise for me was the “a ha” that the browser extensions now worked *anywhere* without needing the client installed and syncing set up. This opened 1password features to my work devices and other places it could never be before. Now I’m experimenting with new ways of working as I learn about all the features I’ve been missing out on for years.  Finally, bravo to your engineering and design teams. Across multiple devices and modes every setup “just works”. I went through the vault migration process myself late at night and became confident I could get my wife set up in minutes. And I did. Use is effortles - ""intersection of security and ease"" indeed! But as a technologist I appreciate this takes a tremendous effort by a lot of people to create. It has literally melted my frustration on subscription away and I found myself demonstrating 1p features to a colleague who was mentioning the excel based approach she uses with her team 😬 For any others still grousing about the subscription model - I have witnessed the value, convenience, and ease that comes along with it, and I'm happy to continue my many years as a 1Password user.

I am about to give up on it because you are removing the functionality I depend on from the stand alone app, and only including it in the subscription model. I can get 99% of what I need from the Mac’s built in password manager, and it works in my browser, unlike the newest 1Password stand alone. Based on this, I will not be upgrading and will stop using your app altogether. Very disappointed you have decided to abandon the stand alone version in favor of the subscription model. Update:  hi Blake. Unfortunately you are not correct. Specifically I used 1Password for Safari on my phone and iPad and now it states that to use it, I need a 1Password account. So this is specific functionality that has been removed to force me to go to the subscription model. I will just use apple’s own password manager - I don’t need a subscription for that. I have been a 1Password user since at least version 3, but version 7 will be the last one I use.",US
1833,www.1password.com,2022-05-05T15:54:53.000Z,1,Agilebits abandoned its long-time…,"Agilebits abandoned its long-time customers by switching to a subscription/cloud model and forcing customers to comply or else lose support on major browser updates. Customers who do not want a company holding and managing their secrets must choose a different tool. Edit for clarification:  Per AgileBits support: ""The newly released 1Password 8 apps only work with 1Password accounts, and don't support older standalone vaults synced with third party services, such as Dropbox."" The original 1Password model allowed customers to store their secrets locally or with a 3rd party like DropBox. The new subscription model forces customers to store their secrets with AgileBits, the company that runs 1Password.  This new model means that customers must trust one company to both write the encryption software and to physically hold the secrets. Consequently, a bad actor within AgileBits could compromise the encryption in their customer's software and ALSO have access to the secrets. Previously, while a bad actor could have compromised the encryption, they would have no access to the actual secrets (provided you control network access, of course). Aside from the subscription requiring regular payments, which is perfectly acceptable and worth it, they allow no option for customers to store their secrets anywhere besides within AgileBits' systems. Customers can continue to use the older 1Password 6, but AgileBits ended support for it so they will not update it to support new browser certificates. Customers have lost and will continue to lose the ability to use 1Password's various browser integrations.",US

Creating and changing passwords can be a bit more complex, as I have passwords in multiple browsers, in various applications, all requiring a different way of creating and changing passwords.

1840,www.1password.com,2022-05-02T18:51:41.000Z,5,Excellent customer service,"I've recently decided to try the subscription model of 1Password again, having been a User of their stand-alone software for some years on my iMac. I found an offer online, then after subscribing, found a much better offer, which allowed me to include my Wife's PC in a Family subscription. This left me with a little work to do regarding which email related to which offer. I also had problems trying to remove a previously 'frozen' account [vault], when I tried (but then rejected) the subscription model, 3 years ago. The final problem concerned the actual cost of the new subscription detailed in their reminders about the trial period ending etc. and the exact cost - which didn't appear to be a 3-year deal with 50% off (as a long standing User). So I mailed 1Password for help in sorting this out. Well, I have to say that I had excellent customer service from all the 1Password support staff and within about 3 cycles of emails, I had the answers that I needed, including a simple email link which allowed me to delete the old 'frozen' password vault. This made life so much easier, as I had by then finished tidying up my existing set of passwords (many of which were redundant when reviewed). I don't think I've had such good customer support since my last minor gripe with Amazon - who frankly lead the way IMHO when resolving any support related issues. So due to the excellent help I had from Ixquel, Paul, Anthony and lastly, Alex I am now about to become a fully paid up User of 1Password. Very well done guys! PS one little tip I learned from them - do try to get all your questions asked in one email (if possible), as by adding bits of extra information in further emails actually puts you further back in their email queue; apparently they answer them in a received-order basis. I found that a little odd, but on second thoughts, I guess it is logical (and means they don't leave old emails behind unanswered). Best regards Terry :)",GB

The customer support was very strong. They have detailed response templates and were able to help me solve my problem.  Two minor weaknesses: 1. The first support reply took longer than I expected; I think more than a day, and a few other back and forths took over night. This was reasonable, but sometimes felt long. 2. One of the replies was a stock template that didn't address my direct question. When I pointed it out, I got a quick reply apologizing and answering. Overall, I felt like I was in very good hands and getting the right answers. My issue was solved and I was provided lots of good information along the way. Update after receiving company response to my review (below):  The reply from the company is consistent with my support experience—templates stick response that is very good but doesn’t show understanding or careful read. Stick replies are efficient and good for lots of things, but would feel better with a little bit of personalization to the issues raised.",US

But I did recently have an issue where I was suddenly getting email notifications literally in the middle of the night that someone was signing into my 1Password account from a location several hundred miles away from me. This had never happened previously in the past several years I have been using 1Password, so I assumed the worst and cancelled my 1Password account, changed nearly all of my passwords (using Safari, which took a few hours), and eventually started a new 1Password account- which I have to admit I don't quite feel comfortable with at the moment. Emails to 1Password support informed me that: ""because of the nature of Apple's Privacy features, there is no saying when you can receive these notifications. It is random when Apple will change the IP address that is assigned to your device. 1Password sees this change in IP and believes that you are signing in from a new device, while we have made some changes on our side, we still do not have total control over these messages as we still need to keep things secure when new devices actually sign in. These notifications can even come when you are not using your device, if the device has an internet connection, you can get one of these notifications."" Some warning that this could occur would have been very helpful, especially as this is a new issue. To their credit, 1Password Support did clearly explain the situation (though after the fact), and did facilitate transferring my account over to the new one. After contacting Customer Support, it did take about 24 hours to get a response.",US

Hands down one of the most used and most crucial apps in my daily computing. While the application has continued to exceed my expectations for years, the browser extension's recent overhaul has been a challenge to use. Where I'm fortunately able to find the ""old"" 1Password extension by ID, simply searching only brings up the ""new"" version or the ""beta"" version. With a recent configuration issue I attempted to use the new extension that does not require an app to be installed on my Mac, but this forces different keyboard shortcuts and alters the workflow heavily on mouse usage. Where it certainly looks more polished, it makes usage more difficult and popups regularly occur on webpages where they should not be. Sadly, since all websites are coded differently, 1Password engineers can only handle so many edge cases. I do hope they will continue to support the extension that relies on a native app being installed, the workflow and experience was/is significantly better. If they ever remove the old extension, I likely will find an alternative for my family subscription.",US

My first version was version 3, and I'm very happy with the product. Some time ago, 1Password has switched from the one-time license model to the subscription license model (like many/most software providers).  Both models have pros and cons, and initially I was a bit disappointed to have to pay every year. But on the other side, I get regularly updated software - something very important in this area. And, also with the one-time license, I had to buy or upgrade to a new license every couple years. So the difference is not that big.  Furthermore, after discussing the switch from one-time to subscription and the higher costs with the 1Password support team, they offered me a nice reduction on the subscription. All in all fair and generous. Thanks and keep up the good work.",AT

2057,www.1password.com,2022-04-05T20:54:12.000Z,4,1Password is awesome.,"1Password is awesome. My family and I have been customers since 2017, when I subscribed to a family plan. More recently, I joined a company that uses 1Password and it has been great to manage my personal and business information using a single platform. I sincerely recommend it - I actually have done this many times over these years. Up to about one year ago, I'd give 1Password 5 stars without blinking. There are two reasons I went for 4 stars: 1. I had issues the last two times the program suggested an update on Mac. On both occasions the update failed right after uninstalling the program, which forced me to reinstall it manually. 2. Since mid last year I've been using 1Password on a few Linux machines and I really miss the simplicity of unlocking it with the fingerprint reader. The problem here is that, unlike other programs, 1Password doesn't support creating a separate PAM configuration and I cannot enable that option for the entire system. The positive outcome of these two issues is that I ended up interacting with the company's support. I was definitely impressed by how friendly and attentive they are.",CA

LastPass has been everything horrible about it, Safari and Chrome are too locked down, and 1Password, though it is the best, most user-friendly GUI out of all of them, still stumbles to take the crown. Why? Because it fails to address customer needs when they stand in the way of profit margins.  Children, gather round - for I have a story to tell. Once upon a time there was a thing called perpetual licensed software.  If you're young enough, you probably don't know what that is.  Essentially, you bought a product, and its license of use was owned by you, the consumer. Nowadays, the subscription model has grown to be the ultimate cash stream.  Companies can hide behind excuses like: ""security will continuously be updated"", ""GUI improvements will keep coming"", and ""just trust us; this is better."" But the problem is that (especially companies that started off with selling software that had perpetual licenses) it feels like a true bait and switch.  This is especially true when you take away key components that bring your customers back. For 1Password (version 7, most notably), you used to be able to create/store/maintain your own encrypted vault through DropBox (or other means).  When they took this vital feature away [in version 8], it created a great divide - to use their newer software ever again, you would have to use their vault storage that (surprise!) required a monthly/annual subscription. I get that the model for subscription is more attractive and DOES have some good points, but when you ostracize the key group that helped you reach the top of the game, it feels wrong, disingenuous, slimy, and straight up manipulative.  Perpetual licensing for 1Password 8 or 9 or above would make things so much better. Should they reintroduce the feature, I will be back but I think their increased revenue stream might be too attractive to pass up.",US

I trust completely and it and feel better having hundreds of stronger randomized passwords locked inside it, and have converted many people over to using it! It's also one of the few apps that I'm excited to read the release notes of every update (which is frequent!) Compatibility-wise, I've extremely impressed at how many platforms and browsers 1P works with and how consistent it appears across them all. Speaking of visuals, it's one of the most beautiful Windows apps around, and a joy to use and look at. Sometimes there's issues syncing user-uploaded icons across platforms, but I attribute those to version 8 (new) growing pains and it's not a big deal. The ability to collaborate with other users securely with shared vaults is also very handy - I can split my own passwords into vaults based on shared interest groups like friends/family/husband and share certain vaults with specific groups of people. And now that my workplace adopted the enterprise version of 1P, I can import that vault and have every password I could possibly need all in one application.

That, and, every single time you use the extension, you have to put in an even longer password to access 1Password than you ever could have dreamt of for the website you're trying to access.  I understand the value of the latter point from a security standpoint, but why am I forced to input my secret key every morning? It's not like I keep it in a document on my computer where I can just copy and paste it in (because then it's not a secret key, is it?

2320,www.1password.com,2022-03-12T22:52:58.000Z,1,"1Password was once great, but no more. Stay far away.","What was once hands down the best password manager in the business has instead become a complete a nightmare. In the past year AgileBits (the creators of 1Password) has shifted development from a wonderful native app to an atrocious Electron app, eliminated standalone licenses, and most egregiously eliminated the ability to have a local non-cloud based vault. Now, in order to use 1Password you must pay a monthly subscription and store all of your most important items, your passwords, in the 1Password cloud! Furthermore, AgileBits has been accepting a ton of VC money, which does not bode well for future decisions as all of the above controversial changes occurred shortly after the first round of an influx of VC money. *EDITED POST REPLY* While I appreciate the reply, no amount of reassurance will make the move to Electron a positive thing. I completely understand that the backend of 1Password has been rewritten in Rust, which is a great thing, but Electron is still Electron no matter how well it is implemented. As important as a safe, secure and efficient backend is, the GUI is just as important, if not more so. The bottom line is Electron will NEVER have a GUI as good or as fluid as a native app. I have been beta testing the Mac version of 1Password 8 since it was first released, and resource usage (as a result of Electron) has consistently doubled, if not triple, the amount of resources that 1Password 7 uses. In addition, since Electron is nothing more than a wrapper for the Chromium browser engine, the interface itself is decidedly non-native. Specifically, while it looks perfectly fine on Big Sur and above, it looks completely and horribly out of place on Catalina. If Apple chooses to change up their interface in the future (which the most definitely will), 1Password will immediately look out of place. I just wish someone from AgileBits would straight up admit that the only reason 1Password was moved to Electron was for cost-cutting reasons and that's it. It certainly wasn't for usability reasons. Speaking of cost-cutting, there is a sick irony to the fact that AgileBits has accepted a ton of VC money, and the first thing they do is cut costs by moving from a great native app to a subpar Electron app. Instead of putting the 10's of millions of dollars toward creating a world-class native app experience (on ALL platforms), AgileBits has taken the money and used it to for marketing and double speak. And I noticed a complete lack of reply when it comes to the elimination of standalone licenses and forcing users to store all of their passwords in the 1P cloud. From a business standpoint, this makes sense, as it justifies users having to pay a perpetual subscription to use 1Password. From a user standpoint, however, it is not only hostile, but straight up insulting. I DON'T want to store my passwords in the 1P cloud, let alone any cloud; forcing your users to do so is reprehensible. Fortunately, there are a ton of options now when it comes to storing your passwords in a secure, safe and user friendly way. As a result of this, I think AgileBits is going to greatly, greatly regret the horrible decisions they have made over the past year or so.",US

They asked me to verify a couple of things, in addition they set expectations correctly. I ran through the suggestions but unfortunately, still not working. Reported that back and next day, I had a reply he went over the logs and noticed a bunch of errors which let him suggest to deinstall the 1Password app from the iPhone and reinstall.

YES, I had to destroy my original account (and, if I *had* populated the account with passwords, they would have been lost - but again, not the fault of the software, but my own absent-mindedness).

The instructions worked and the 1Password install and migration of password data was nearly effortless and totally flawless. Since I had all of my passwords and license codes I could download the latest software, some of which was different due to the jump to Monterey, and easily get it running. The software design team really understands how things should work and the support team makes you feel like you are their most important customer.

These are Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS. 1Password is additionally the password manager I have experienced, is best integrated on most platforms in terms of design and features. The design of the 1Password apps is far ahead of any of their competitors in my opinion. 1Password does as it promises: Quick insertion of logins when logging in while generating secure passwords and saving these. It is a super idea that 1Password a few months ago began a collaboration with Fastmail to create masked emails easily and quickly. However, please be aware that the integration does not work on all websites, and one thus has to manually create a masked email on Fastmail.com. I am certain they will work on adding more websites to support this feature in the future. I have been in contact with support about billing who responded within approx. 1-2 days and solved my problem fast and professionally. I think that is what you can expect - so well done. No review without something which can be improved or added: - An option to add a Fastmail email to a login when masked emails are created manually when the popup does not appear on the email field.

It's popup often overlays whatever it is you need to fill in, and because it is so fast to jump to your assistance, you often cannot see what it is offering to fill in without navigating away from the field and going back. Because of the limited screen real-estate on a phone screen, this can often be more of a hindrance than a help. On a PC screen or tablet screen, this is not an issue. I can turn this feature off entirely, but then I lose the benefit when I most need it. For now, I learn to adapt. I love the configurability of this application and the ability to store much more than just passwords. I keep track of what is in my wallet in case I lose it, what is in my safe deposit box, etc., membership cards, passport details. The list goes on for those things you can store in your personal vault. And because it is in the Cloud, it is always available to you with an Internet connection. I am a lifetime subscriber.

I've been using the service and apps for nearly a decade, and I've never had a negative experience or hit a bug that wasn't acknowledged and fixed immediately. In the few times that I've needed assistance, Customer Care has been responsive, helpful, and engaged.  Managing several thousand passwords (for myself and clients) can get messy fast, but 1P makes it a breeze. Everything is kept tidy in one central place, with as much specificity as you need. The apps are reliable and well-integrated in macOS, iOS, and iPadOS (hello auto-fill for authenticator codes!). Add high-speed but secure encryption, and you have a product worth 10x what they charge. If you have a pulse, you need to manage passwords. If you haven't already, do yourself a favor and make life easier ––– sign up for 1Password.",US

Clipboard management in Windows 10 is implemented perfectly (and securely), auto-fill seems to work better and doesn't get in the way as much, you can create custom entries with multiple ""passwords"", tags are great, TOTP integration (one-time passwords), watchtower service is neat and highlighted a few issues I needed to sort out ... the list goes on.

The data migration and integration between devices were super easy. 1password has thought through a lot of things to make transition painless. I like several features of the families plan. Everyone has secure access to their own private vault that nobody else can see, and we can create shared vaults to share information and decide who can see and edit it. If one person is locked out of his account, other family members can help him recover the account. The cost is lower for the  family plan than several individual plans combined.

If you are unable to right click it is because you haven't yet downloaded iPasswords to your computer. Downloading enables many more functions than are available in the Web version. Q. How do I find my secret key? Your secret key will automatically download to your computer when you sign up. Look in your download folder to access and save it.

I have contacted support several times. Updated: with a lot of back and forth with customer service via email the problem was worked around to a resolution.  The app works well but without live customer service when there are problems i wouldn’t rate it higher than 3 stars. They need real time solutions for problems. Days to respond to emails is not user friendly for an app you pay for. I have the family plan and not one of my invitees were able to successfully join my family plan after 11 months of service.

Bitbot (virtual assistant) quickly assigned a ticket number and hours later received an email from a human :-).  My situation involved getting data on 1Password 6.1 on an old iPad over to 1Password 7 on my MacBookPro. Both Chris Jackson and then Errol Lowe were professional and helpful to an extent as they assessed the situation and gave me links to read for iCloud and Dropbox assistance. They didn't know that I was almost ready to give up and manually type 300+ passwords into 1Password 7. Laura Rooke responded and took over my ticket. What a blessing! She too was professional, but additionally had more knowledge about 1Password 6 on an iPad and gave me step by step instructions, answered all my questions (I was scared to do anything that might destroy the password data), assuring me I wouldn't lose the data, and went beyond the scoop of the ticket. The result, I have all the password data in the latest version of 1Password 7 on my MacBookPro and my old iPad has been updated to 1Password 7.

2684,www.1password.com,2022-01-02T04:40:34.000Z,5,"Secure, trustworthy, easy to use, and easy on the eyes too!","I've been using 1Password for several years, on Macs, Windows, iOS, Android, and Linux. I initially bought a subscription through iTunes, but when my credit card expired I was glad to have an opportunity to switch to paying 1Password directly. I don't often buy software, preferring to use free, open-source alternatives, but here I feel it's worth it for the peace of mind and ease of use. 1) It's secure. I save all kinds of important and sensitive information in my 1Password vaults, not just passwords. Documents, ID, banking information, and so on. I trust 1Password because they are very clear about the security technology they employ and how to use it. They use plain English and consistent terms to make sure I can understand how to keep my data safe. Thanks to consistently transparent communication, and independent audits of their software, 1Password have earned my trust and kept it.  2) It's reliable. I've changed computers, phones and operating systems so many times over the years; I've moved house and even moved countries, but I've never had to worry that I'd lose my passwords and important information, because I trust that I can log in to 1Password from wherever I am, on a new machine, and it'll all still be there. 3) It looks good! I can also trust that I can find what I'm looking for quickly and easily no matter what platform I'm on - they've gone to great lengths to make their apps and website design really clear and consistent. I'd even go so far as to say it looks pretty! It's one of the few apps I could say I enjoy using, just because of the way it looks. It feels satisfying. 4) It's easy to use I'm sure a huge amount of work has gone into this behind the scenes, but it's actually so easy to use it's hard to describe. I don't even really have to think about it. I click the icon, enter my password (the only one I have to remember!), and everything is just there. My data is organised for me, but I can tag it too if I want. When I'm on a website I've logged into before, if I saved it in 1Password is ready with my details, even if I've cleared my cookies and browser history, even if it was on a different device! When I'm making an account or signing in for the first time, 1Password is ready to suggest a secure, original password that I'll never have to remember, because it'll then save it automatically, with my email address or username, in my vault. When I'm shopping online, I never have to go get my wallet or trust a website with saving my credit card information, because 1Password knows all my cards and with one click it fills out all the details. And this experience is exactly the same on Android, Windows, Mac, iPhone, Chrome, Firefox... I can't stress this enough, it's ridiculously simple and easy to use. 5) Extra features that are actually useful My favourite extra feature is Watchtower, where it keeps track of vulnerable passwords that are weak or insecure, reused across multiple sites, or most importantly, those that have been compromised by security breaches at companies that have been hacked. I feel this is a really useful and underrated feature, because now I don't have to worry about my passwords getting stolen - as soon as they're compromised, I'm notified and I can change them! Other features that seem really useful but I haven't had much chance to use yet, include multiple vaults, family or company accounts, and secure sharing - for example when your guest needs the wifi password, now you can have a long, secure password without inconveniencing them, by sharing it straight to their phone! Lastly, great customer service! Quick, friendly and polite. Backups and passwords are two places where I'll choose carefully and spend money on software. 1Password have earned my money and my trust, and kept it.",JP

2723,www.1password.com,2021-12-22T22:44:13.000Z,4,Switching from 1Password Standalone to 1Password Account,"After years of using 1Password Standalone I switched to 1Password Account. The older members of my family one by one got to a point where they needed more and more of my help using 1Password, most frequently due to Dropbox synchronization problems between iOS devices and MacOS laptops. Worse yet, in one case, one member got so frustrated with these problems that they had completely stopped using 1Password and reverted to a small set of very poor passwords. After switching to a Single User 1Password Account I was impressed how much easier password management became and I convinced myself that a Family Plan would not only fix synchronization problems but also get everyone in my family to use 1Password consistently. This review has two parts: my experience of switching from Standalone to Account (which was *not* smooth) and my experience with 1Password Support (which was excellent). Switching from Standalone to Single User Account was very easy -- but then went frighteningly wrong. I have a number of macOS and iOS devices and started with my newest macOS laptop. I followed all instructions except I stored the Emergency Kit in my personal 1Password vault. Then I closed 1Password, took a break, and when I tried to log back into the 1Password app, my old master password did not work anymore! And I had not memorized or jotted down the new Account password. I quickly realized that I had misunderstood a key fact: the 1Password Account password *replaces* the old master password! My wrongly assumed that my old master password would be preserved and that the Account password would only be used for synchronization between devices. This is the model of using 1Password with DropBox: there is the 1Password master password and there is the DropBox account password.  Feedback #1 for 1Password Staff: Please include prominent warnings in your documentation that migrating an app from Standalone to Account will *replace* the old master password with the Account password and that storing the Emergency Kit within the migrated 1Password therefore defeats the Kit's purpose. Luckily I had not yet converted the 1Password apps on all of my iOS devices! Feedback #2 for 1Password Staff: While it's great that one can migrate 1Password apps in a matter of seconds using QR codes, please build into the instructions a step that test whether a user can actually log back into the app that is already migrated before proceeding to migrating all apps. So with the outstanding help of 1Password Support, I was able to delete the 1Password Account, create a new 1Password Account, properly remember the new Account password, migrate my 1Password apps on my iOS devices to the new account, reset the 1Password data on my macOS laptop, and connect it to the new 1Password Account. Because I purchased 1Password Standalone licenses, Support made sure that benefits from that carried over to the new Account (since I had to wipe the older account).  The email exchange was over the course of three days -- which was not the fastest. But given the stakes, I didn't mind. Especially because of the high quality step-by-step instructions and associated explanations of what these instructions were intended to accomplish.  Feedback #3 for 1Password Staff: Your support is excellent. This is the reason why I have been a paying 1Password user for many years.",US

Not being able to access my passwords was incredibly stressful. Fortunately the team client service team ( in particular; Muhammad Hameed) was very quick to respond to my queries and calm me down ). Muhammad was able to assist me in opening a new 1Password account ( I was even offered a 50% discount for 3 years ) and migrate my existing password data from an another Apple device for which I have only fingerprint access to my previous account, to the new account.

I have stuck with it even when others like LastPass came into the market because 1Password was always more feature packed and I really liked all the refinements they have added over the years. I was not a huge fan of the switch to monthly subscription, but I guess I understand that this is necessary to keep innovating. And I certainly would HATE it if it went away!. It is true,  I decided to skip it for a few years, but given that when you pay for a license outright the program is hobbled and some features are missing compared to the subscription, I decided to go ahead and give it a try. I am not sure if I prefer it over the older model, or if I will even benefit from what the subscription offers over purchasing a regular license. However, 1Password has improved, year after year, version after version, offering new features and more security with every update. So it stands to reason that with the help of the other subscribers, we will help 1 Password keep improving.   I am not a power user. In fact, I’m pretty sure there are many features of this program I either don’t know how to use, or I am entirely unaware of. But the ones I do use are stellar.

Over time my needs changed, and it made sense to upgrade to a subscription model product for my password management, mainly to be able to share certain passwords and for onboarding family members, and to a lesser extent to be able to depend on a supported product rather than an outdated and unsupported version.  The 1Password support team responded promptly to my inquiry about promotions for old customers and immediately offered an attractive deal - I didn't need to provide any evidence to support my claim, although they may already have that data from Apple. It was a pleasant experience communicating them and I will most likely continue using 1Password after my subscription becomes full price.

I chose it after reading a few reviews and YouTube videos.  The NY Times review (Wirecutter) was most persuasive.  Anyway, my needs are perhaps a bit more complicated than most.  I use multiple platforms (a Windows desktop, an Android phone, and an Apple mini-iPad) and I had trouble getting 1Password to work across all three.  OK, I'm a ""boomer"", I'll admit it.  So after a few days of obstinate toiling, I finally contacted 1Password's support team.  They quickly cleared up a few misconceptions.  All is now working fine.  Go figure.

The support employee Tej left no stone unturned to help me solve my problem. From the first moment I received answers that did not come from a computer that wanted to get rid of me and sent me standard answers that were not meaningful. 1Password replied to my first email in a professional and solution-oriented manner with a very short response time. The first attempts to solve the problem also failed, but at no point was 1Password a problem. Ultimately, Tej found a way that solved my problem to the maximum satisfaction.

In an attempt to bring everything in line for all three devices, phone, tablet and Mac mini, I updated my master password. The browser extension was still not working and that is when I asked for help. During the process of getting everything working it appears that the new master password has been lost and everything has reverted to one of the variations of the original password – this isn't a problem as I think all devices are now happy with that password; time will tell as the mobiles are using face ID or fingerprint, we'll see.

Their designing is clean and simple, and the overall experience within the apps and 1password software is easy to understand for the everyday use. Though there is this one feature I discussed with one of the 1password staff: Whenever my primary e-mail address is changed, i would like 1password to tell my 1password app, and it would send out an e-mail to all the websites requesting an e-mail change and then change the e-mail address in lets say 200 entries, simply just so i wouldn't have to do this manually.

It’s convenient to only have to remember one master password and you have access to the hundreds of passwords you may use on a daily basis without having to remember them all.  Other benefits include keeping credit card info handy without having to drag your cards out of your wallet every time you want to buy something, secure notes, identities, bank accounts, databases and even software licenses. The program is truly a one stop memory shop. It’s hard remembering all these things and 1Password saves time and hair.

When I explained that I like the 1Password product but didn't need the family plan, Josephine, my customer support teammate, helped me through converting to a single user account and also moved the credit over for being a loyal customer.  That speaks volumes to me about the company's climate for customer service satisfaction over just getting another dollar of profit--at my expense.

Recently I decided to enlist my family and to upgrade to the family plan. As it turns out if you purchase the individual license through Apple there is no self managed path to upgrade. I had to contact support. Not only were they responsive, they answered all my questions before I even asked them. Basically you have to cancel your individual membership but since you usually do that with some days left in your last month paid, you can’t directly upgrade from the website as the option is not available (this could be fixed but I would rather have AgileBits deliver some new feature then fix a one time issue). Instead support must detach the account from Apple, give you a trial, credited you with the prorated amount left on your last month and then you get the option to sign up for the family plan! Well they made this process extremely smooth from explaining clearly what needed to happen and what I needed to do, having one real person talk me through the whole thing, patient and responsive (this was done in less than 24h).

(long term user),"hey, guys just want to express gratitude to you guys and inspire others who may want to try your program.  I have been a 1password user with the original software many years ago, and then recently I upgraded to the new version 1password 7.  Initially, I was a little annoyed for having to pay a yearly fee and a slightly higher fee than other companies, but then upon research, I realized that I was being cheap and unwise because I was actually losing a lot more money by not having this software, here is why...    I am an online business owner and I travel a lot, and as you know there are a few 'bad' apples everywhere, and I have been hacked before.  let me tell you, that is NOT an experience you want to have because it takes so much time and money to be able to clean up the mess and restore harmony.  Having said that it costs alot for a company to develop such a powerful app, encrypted and secure, fast, constantly making updates, and hire and keep an A-player world-class customer support team.  So for me to pay such minimum fees on a yearly basis to keep my passwords safe, my business running and money flowing in is a no brainer! It is one of those things I use every single day!

3376,www.1password.com,2021-09-26T18:51:58.000Z,1,Forcing a subscription model,"I've used 1Password for Mac and iOS since 2015 and have paid for the standalone licence and paid to upgrade to v7 when it was released.  The product itself has served me well, but no thanks to the developer/publisher, AgileBits, who'd made it very difficult to find the way to purchase the standalone licence over the years. They've pushed harder and harder to force customers to a ridiculously expense subscription model. Apparently, the next release (v8) will require a monthly subscription, as it'll require moving the storage to their servers, rather than giving you the control. They've also recently updated their iOS app to remove essential functionality around shared sheets, which was integral to ease of retrieval for sites where auto-fill wouldn't work. In effect, rather than deciding to add features to the software to encourage you to pay to upgrade, they've decided to remove features -- including hosting your passwords on your own computer or with the cloud provider of your choice -- to force you on to an expensive subscription model.  Don't subscribe! Doing so simply encourages them to continue making changes to further lock you in to their subscription model. These changes are for their benefit, not yours. Time to move to an alternative, like iCloud Keychain, KeePassXC, or Bitwarden. Edit in response to 1password’s reply: $3 per month is a ridiculous price to charge for this service. Take a cue from BitWarden, who provide an equivalent service at a fraction of your price. Their premium subscription includes the option to host with them (and actually gives a legitimate reason to host with them — emergency access), while also having the option to self-host (leaving it to the customer to decide what’s best for them based on their circumstances), supports iOS share sheets, and costs $10 per year. *That* — not your $36 per year — is a reasonable price for a password manager service. Licensing two people for BitWarden is less than 2/3 the cost of licensing one person for 1Password.",GB

3428,www.1password.com,2021-09-20T14:35:58.000Z,4,First Time Password-manager User,"I was skeptical about using a password manager for my accounts. I've always been comfortable with writing login information down on a piece of paper, but it evidently became too much. Everything about 1Password thus far has been great; it's easy to use, you have a sense that your information is secure, I now don't need to memorize dozens of login information.  Recommendations: I use more than one browser between my Windows computer and my Mac device. When importing my information from these browsers into 1Password, I would end up having several of the same login credentials that would come up when logging into a website. It would be nice if there was a detection system within 1Password that could notice this, notify you that this exists in your account, and offers to delete the duplicate login credentials so that only one remains. Lastly in regards to looks, it would be nice if the layout, color scheme, fonts, etc., were consistent across all platforms - web browser extension, website portal, desktop application, and smartphone application. The desktop application has the most dated appearance to it. The dark mode-like theme in the browser extensions and smartphone app is pleasing to use and has a sleek, modern look to it that is much appreciated. To have this in the web portal and the desktop application would be incredible.  Thanks for reading a lengthy review!",US

Their responses have always been prompt, polite, understanding and detailed.  Exactly what I need when a question is being answered.  Without a doubt I can honestly say they have been the most consistent across their departments for all of the above areas and each individual I corresponded with always made sure I was happy with the outcome.  I have outlined the reason below why I moved to another password application and I don't believe I will regret the decision as there has yet to be any issue that we have not resolved together.  Thank you 1Password, you have made my security, processes and systems a much better and easier place to administer. I have migrated from another password manager which was perfectly capable but the customer support was terrible.  Even though previously I had ""Premium"" support, I felt like I had no support and was not considered valuable.  My issues were outstanding (some in excess of 6 months!) and any communications that I sent were not read correctly or acted upon accordingly.  I could do nothing and felt worthless to this huge company.  I knew that even my leaving would not phase them and sure enough, when my subscription came for renewal I was given no consideration for my patience and loyalty.

In particular, I have really liked the fact that all my passwords and other key personal data is located in one central, secure and easily accessible location. Recently my old standalone version (1Password 6) stopped working with the latest Mac OS upgrade. After contacting support, they said that the Big Sur upgrade was causing issues with older versions of the 1Password software, and suggested that I consider moving to 1Password 7 which is a subscription product.  I haven't generally been a big fan of subscription model software, but faced with the option of possibly not having this product, it was a relatively easy decision to get a 1Password membership and set up my various computer, tablet  and phone devices for the new software.  In the end, the migration path was smooth, and I had 1Pasword 7 running quite quickly. Email support from the support team was timely and friendly.  There are a couple of features of the old product that I miss, such as the ability to see all my Favourites from 1Password extension. On the other hand the syncing capability of the new software works much better across all of my devices. It appears that I shall continue to be a happy user of this product for some time to come!",AU

I was trying to export from passwords from Bitwarden to LastPass. Bitwarden gives CSV file. It is impossible to do so in LastPass. LastPass is there in other Business for so long, but they simple could not address this simple thing. If do not believe me, try yourself with 1Password. It knows how to solve this problem.

When you put your credentials somewhere, think of Support you might receive.

The email back-and-forth with the support techs was excellent and all issues were solved.  My only complaint is that there is no phone support.  I am sure that the questions the support group helped me with could have been handled in one phone call.  I recommend a service such as Apple support provides via phone calls.  Customer frustration levels would be greatly lowered when the support can happen quickly versus over days or weeks of emails.  One factor I believe is important is that not all computer users are young and tech savvy.  I am a senior citizen and don't always know even the terminology that is used.  I also object to live chats, which my experience with other companies has been that the chats are unnecessarily long and drawn out because of the scripts the support people are required to use.

It asks you to choose between a mini and 7 version, but it doesn't explain what the difference is between the two. I re-installed in on my Mac but all I get is what I had before.

Two wonderful techs,  Mike and Chris, very patiently emailed me through the process. A huge thank you to them.

My spouse and I each have a private vault plus a shared vault for common accounts like banking.  It took a little time to work through resetting all the weak and reused passwords I had.  Now I have zero reused passwords.  All system generated and I don't have to remember any of them.  Chrome, Edge and phone apps interface to 1Password perfectly.   There are 3 user interfaces.  A Windows App, Browser and Mobile app.  You can do everything you need from any of the three but it takes a little hunt and peck to find all the features in each UX.  Once you export your current passwords from your phone or browser, it makes like a lot easier to deleted them all.  Even after Chrome reported that it was using 1Password, it still had a tendency to popup it's own password.  Once I deleted all Chrome passwords, everything worked perfect. For under $5.00 a month you can protect your entire family.  Get this tool.  You will love it.",US

Each time something in the password world changes 1Password has the solution. Recently one of my apps that uses 2FA eliminated the choice I normally use (email because I do not have cell service where I live). The app offered either a SMS message or a separate Authenticator app. I have used 1Password at other sites as the Authenticator app but was unable to get it to work with the specific app and their new selection choices. I reached out to 1Password support and two emails later I had a set of instructions that allowed me to use 1Password as the Authenticator!  Great service and a great tool!,US

This should be a huge red flag. My company decided to finally use a password manager. After reading reviews online I decided to give 1Password a shot. I went four days without a response. They claim to offer 24/7 support, but I doubt that. What if we had a technical issue? It was only after I signed up for a trial that someone reached out to me. They were far from helpful. Instead of answering my questions they gave me a generic answer and linked me to a support page. I actually couldn't stop laughing when I saw that they had copied and pasted what was in the support article. I posted on their forums and they admitted they were at fault. A few weeks later I came to post a question, as we are considering using them again and noticed that they had completed deleted my post from their forum. Guess they don't want the general public to see them admitting to being wrong. Thankfully I took a screenshot of the forum posts to send my colleague which I still have. They were also not honest about their pricing. We wanted to be billed monthly for the first four months to make sure 1Password would be a good fit for us. They told us we could only pay annual when they in fact do offer annual billing. Nothing about this company sits well with me. We went with a cheaper competitor, got a demo the same day I sent my email, had someone help us get setup and they even check in with us to see how things are going.

I recently raised a query with the support team and have to say that I was most impressed with their response.  Not only were they most helpful in resolving my problem but they actually pointed out that I had 2 accounts set up - an individual account and a family account, and that I was paying a subscription for both.  I had not realised this.  Not only did the team assist me to delete the individual account but they arranged for a refund of the subscription that I had paid for it.  In today's world this honesty is rare and would like to take this opportunity record my appreciation to the team. I would be extremely happy to recommend 1Password to anyone looking for a Password Manager.",GB

Some people don't like the white spaces in the interface, but I'm happy with the lay-out on the mac and ios versions.

After I started doing some work from home, and banking, and everything else (that gift from the lab which cannot be named), I decided I needed security and protection, not just for me, but my clients and even friends. Certainly after having pour NE corridor hacked and other recent big hacks which cost a fortune and created havoc, I do not understand why everyone does not have significant security. But, this is my experience. I wanted to get the bet protection I could, I read through everything from inert and the like to Wirecutter. It ends up that Bezos can afford to buy the best (All through his Amazon, Ring, EERO, and everything else. EERO has good customer service and also took it upon themselves to leverage out their size and negotiate some good security plans to offer to their customers. The most security is with their EERO Security Plus. The plan has 1Password (1PW), Malwarebytes and Encrypt.me. All excellent. I had previously used 1Password a few years ago on past computers. When I installed it this time I had some issues (not with the plan, but with my installation, both being a tech imbecile and also the past account creating issues). I shot out an email to 1PW to see if the could help. They can and did. They respond immediately and not with boilerplate blurbs or linked to a fat site, they addressed me directly and my issues directly. It took over a period of a day (but that was my fault as it was a work day and I could not respond to them with the speed with which they responded to me). It ended up being quick and easy (it often is when you know what you are doing...that would be them, not me). They had to pass off to several associates, but each responded immediately and had all notes from my prior queries. The CS agents/Tech Support are very quick., very knowledgeable, patient and generous of spirit. The 1PW plan is every bit as the reviews from my research stated, it is actually even as good as they (1PW) claim it is. Great product with great support. Lots of protection. What's not to like?

I am however already paying for a Family subscription. I had tested 1Password before but only for a short time and ended up returning to my existing provider Lastpass. One reason was that Lastpass was slightly cheaper and offered a very good free option and I thought that if I ever needed to go back to it, I could use the free version with everything ready to use. However recent changes in Lastpass, some news around that apps tracking, together with the fact that I never quite warmed to the Lastpass design made we want to try a new password manager that I hoped would make other family members  more interested in using it.  However my Lastpass subscription had auto renewed in February and I was stuck with my subscription.  So I was going to test it now or later in the year with view to changing in the new year when my subscription is ending.   I first gave Nordpass a try which has a beautiful design but unfortunately is currently not compatible with Chromebooks. Then I reached out to 1Password about the possibility of having another trial period to test out their product and enquired about any deals. To my delight 1Password gave me 6 MONTH free trial which allowed me to fully migrate my other family members and provided me with the opportunity to continue using it when my other password manger subscription and the 1Password trial period come to an end. It was also easy to pick up with 1Password since my previous account only needed activating and I didn't have to start from scratch. I admit that I have not tested all the different features of both password managers, but would say that based on my experience and numerous reviews  that the features are quite similar. Lastpass uses  of label folder system whereas 1Password uses a vault and label system.  Ultimately I found that 1Password is easy to use and that there are lots of very easy user guides on their website.  Once I was familiar with the interface I found it both more pleasing to the eye and easier to use, especially as a family manager.  I admit that I slightly preferred the Nordpass design, but to my 2nd delight 1Password announced the roll out of a new version which looks stunning and even more functional. I already find that 1Password has superior password saving experience to Lastpass and Nordpass for example. There is an option to reveal your password that including counting of characters. So if you are asked about the your 4th, 7th and 9th character you simply click on large reveal on 1Password and it will have the numbers underneath. Super useful. To me the ease of use and the beautiful design together with obvious foundation of good security and 0 trackers, rich functionality and a great website have made 1Password my preferred choice. This will make it easier for other family members to make more use of a password manager and safe online practices. I really look forward to the new 1Password apps that will come out over the next months.  Ultimately using a password manager is more important than which kind of password manager, and if ease of use and design encourages the use of such a tool its worth spending money on.",GB

So I didn't have to wait for the trial to end, only to realize that I couldn't pay. I ended up choosing an alternative method to pay which worked. One thing to note is that they were kind enough to restart my trial so I would have some time in figuring out my payment method. I was very surprised by how quick and helpful the 1password customer support is.

Since I seldom used 1PW on the laptop, I eventually had a situation where newly-added 1PW data on the 3 Dropbox devices was unavailable on the laptop running 1PW7.   The tech support at 1PW was superb in helping me to upgrade the iMac to 1PW7, move all the Dropbox data to the 1PW server without duplications or corruptions, and synchronize all 4 devices.

I'm very impressed with the software and the support. Before I was even a paying customer, I sent a query to Support and received a detailed response in a matter of hours. Impressive. I spent nearly 40 years in IT with my last position being the Vice President, Operations for a software development company. I think I have a pretty good instinct for good and bad apps. Having watched 1Password evolve over the years and deciding I wanted to change, i did a great deal of analysis before hand. 1Password came out on top for me. While my previous supplier was good, there were a few ""undocumented features"" that bothered me, the cost was more than I was willing to pay, and support was slow. 1Password has one benefit I think everyone should consider. They are one of the few companies that offers a truly FREE trial period. While you have to provide a credit card, it is only charged once you finish the trial period and you keep the product.  For those of you moving from a competitor, my move was seamless. Follow the guides and you shouldn't have a problem importing your data. Everything came over perfectly for me. From a usability perspective, new users may have an advantage. Coming from a competitor, I was doing some things out of habit. I need to retrain. New users have a clean slate. Three things worked in favour of my 1Passord decision. First, great support, second, pricing, third, ease of transition.",CA

Currently, however, the free Dropbox account is limited to three devices, so I decided to to upgrade to a 1Password subscription for the extra features and to be able to sync all my devices in iCloud. I also like the fact that a subscription provides continuing support for the 1Password team, which has provided excellent software and support over the years. When I sent an email to customer support asking some technical questions about the upgrade, I received a quick response with accurate information and an introductory price on the upgrade, which made the upgrade decision even easier. This is par for the course. Although I have only had to use customer support only once or twice over the years, 1Password support never disappoints. The app itself is great.

Initial pain was migrating in usernames/passwords from my LastPass. It imported the details ok, but each time you visit a site for the first time using 1Password, you are prompted to select which Logins to use on the site :( Other major bug-bears are it not prompting you to save an updated password when you enter a new one on a saved page (what is the point of the service if it doesn't do this??). Painful also is having to click on the Edge toolbar to login when you use it each day. Why not popup the password prompt when you try to complete a userId/Password field for saved site? Also very poorly thought out implementation of Identities, e.g. DOB is stored in a field called ""birth date"" - if you try to fill out a form that has a field called ""date of birth"" nothing auto-completes, so now I have had to save multiple fields with the same value (Birth Date, Date of Birth, DOB etc.). Same for things like Last Name - I've had to save this as ""Surname"" and ""Family Name"" also. Watchtower (security report) is not a patch on the equivalent version in LastPass which provides a much more comprehensive set of features, and allows you to auto-update some major services (e.g. Gmail/Yahoo etc.).

Their set-up is uniquely secure in that you must have several items of information in order to log into your account. There is a learning curve when you switch from the name of your pet to having all unique passwords, so at first it can seem difficult. It really isn't. It's really just the small amount of extra time it takes to copy and paste things. At least you don't have to manually type in a 24 character long password, and using unique passwords is becoming more and more important these days. I myself have clicked on an email only to regret it. I work with a few elderly people and have taught them how to use 1Pass. It's all too typical that the names of pets and street names seem easier. Simple patience with something new is all it takes and they're safe and sound. I'll add that 1Password's customer service can't be beat. They respond quickly, and if the FAQs don't get you where you need to go they'll give you specific advice. I can't stress enough how much this has helped. Also, the price is right.

4532,www.1password.com,2021-05-16T16:41:21.000Z,5,Amazing App! Legitimately SUPERB Customer Service.,"First, I need to say that I absolutely love 1Password which I have been using back in the day when it was still free and did not even require a subscription. Last year, I thought I'd get my parents to use 1Password and so I subscribed to the family plan. However, a year went by and they did not use it much because they still preferred the old pen/paper method and adding additional technology/software into their daily routines is not something they were very interested in. I must note though that my mother said she really found the app to be easy to use and quite neat given that it can sync across devices along with having such high-level security - she most definitely understood why it was my preferred choice of password storage. While it was not a good feeling to have to switch from a family to an inidvidual personal account, I must say that the 1Password Customer Service team made it extremely easy for me to do so. Yes, I could have done it on my own online but it was not about that. They answered every single one of my questions, reclarified when I was not clear on a response, and their responses were very prompt. I might also add that they continue to respond during odd hours of the day like at 2 AM which is definitely outside of business hours - because they CARE. When I am storing such important information in an app, I want to know that if something happens, I can get help that is both effective and quick. My experience started with Ronan Lyver who really went above and beyond in multiple ways, trying to make the experience as great as it could be for me including ways to save money. Considering that I reached out on a Friday afternoon, we had six back-and-forth emails before Ronan's colleague Kaley took over with a very easy transition (knowing everything that Ronan and I had spoken about without asking me to rehash the situation all over again). Kaley's response came to me at 11:25 PM EST! She also went above and beyond, introducing me to specific offers to make 1Password even more affordable for me. These savings accumulate and are well appreciated, but they offered these to me without me even having to ask about other ways to save money. A company that does this is a true testament to the fact that they care more about the customer experience than their company and it is those companies that succeed! In my last encounter before my question was fully answered/issue resolved, I was transferred to Saif Ahmad who provided me with the tools/instructions needed. I have interacted with so many customer service representatives and 1Password's CS team STANDS OUT! I can honestly continue to type for hours but I think you get the point from everything I have written so far. Thanks so much Ronan, Kaley, Saif and the 1Password team!",CA

Unfortunately, they also hacked my email account where they then scanned my emails and redeemed a gift voucher given to me only the day prior. When I went to use it, I found that it had already been redeemed. This confirmed that I needed to finally choose a professional password system to manage access to the web sites that I visit. After several reviews, I chose 1Password Manager.  As an older person, not conversant with setting up new systems, and after a less than successful start, I enlisted the help of one of my daughter's and its all gone smoothly since. It's a fairly easy system to use, and a few days later, I'm very happy knowing that my system is now secure - I should have done this years ago but like many, I procrastinated! 1Password gives 7 days free access to try it out, so give it a go.

Messing with all my passwords and migrating was a somewhat scary thought for me. What if ....things go wrong ?  I looked at the migration video provided by 1password on their website and it all seemed so simple. With the necessary precautions I signed up for a trial version and started the process. Before I could blink my eyes it was over 1Password told me that all my 'old vault items' were migrated to the new account based vault.  I was skeptical, 'this was all too smooth' and I thought something had gone wrong as I had anticipated.  But I WAS WRONG !! THE WHOLE PROCESS WAS SMOOTH and everything was nicely copied over in a matter of seconds and I could start to use the new account based vault.  Also adding other devices like iPad, iPhone and Iwatch was easy by just following the instructions.  So time to create some shared vaults place a few items in it and invite other family members.  My spouse already had her own iCloud based vault (V6) and also this was migrated to the family account in a matter of seconds leaving her nicely with her own private vault in the family account and the few items I had already put in the shared vault.  So all in all great and smooth transition. After this experience I decided to fully subscribe to the service and provide my credit card details for payment but I still had 1 question left so before doing so I decided to contact Support by sending an email not expecting and email soon as it was very early in the morning USA time. Much to my suprise the response was prompt and very correct offering an immediate solution to my question.  So a after a great migration experience I now also had a GREAT SUPPORT experience. I'm not a big fan of subscription based services but sometimes one has to recognize that for a company to be able to deliver good products and service it is required to make some money. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS.",NL

Services like 1Password help you responsibly secure and use that space. I first was introduced to 1Password, after reading an article in Wired about how a Wired writer by means of social engineering, common passwords across multiple platforms, and not using two factor authentication had his entire digital world erased. His Google Drive, Gmail, iCloud, laptop, iPhone, and iPad were all locked or erased by the hacker. He lost photos of his children that he had no longer copies of, something that was priceless. Why all this? Because the hackers wanted his OG Twitter handle @mat. In that moment I knew that every website I used in the future had to have its own password. Flash forward four years, I now use 1Password for all my passwords and important docs. Every password is the maximum length and complexity the website or service allows for, since I'm not typing it why do I care.  The passwords used simply cannot be broken through brute force by today's computers within my lifetime. 1Password allowed me to step up my game when it comes to personal digital security without having to give up any convenience offer by Apple's keychain and Safari auto-fill. In fact as soon as the OS allowed for it, I completely disabled auto fill from keychain based passwords and deleted all password records in it.  As the digital space evolved, so has 1Password. I now use their Canadian based service that deliberately creates guardrails in where my information is stored and by whom it can be accessed should I need support. 1Password took the requirements of GDPR and turned them into an asset.  1Password makes me feel safe and confident that my PII is secure and yet accessible to me whenever I need it.",CA

Dump Dashlane!,"Decided to try 1Password after Dashlane was starting to have reliability issues. 1Password's latest version outperforms Dashlane by a huge margin. It is intuitive, reliably saves passwords every single time, it is very flexible, and works flawlessly across my many Mac devices. I did have a minor hiccup when my trial was ending, as my Family Account was set up as a separate account from the trial. However, I was able to export my trial password entries into a text file, and then import them into my Family Account, and that worked flawlessly. I needed some help with some of this from your support center, but they were amazingly good, and they seem to work around the clock. I have never had such incredible support from any software company. By the way, Dashlane's export function DOES NOT WORK at all! That created some work, but it was worth it to upgrade my password tools to a world class product.",US

I've reached out to 1Password and the next morning Tommy Hightower responded and took the time to find out why those issues were happening on my end. When he discovered the cause/root of the problem, he sent me a step-by-step direction on how to rectify the situation.

You see, I was willing to give the cloud a go, but it simply doesn’t work.  I would very much like for the things I pay for to work.  It’s like someone selling me a car, promising 4 wheels and only delivering a shell with 3 wheels.  Not acceptable.  DEFINITELY reportable to the BBB.  Funny how the payment process went without a hitch.  Hmmm. I did have a FREE version of this software for YEARS.  I know this because I know I never paid for it.  Now you’re just scamming everyone.  And whatever happened to the customer being right?  Did you throw that out the window with your morals and good coding practice? You took an otherwise decent product and $ucked it up.

The number one complaint when I talk to my friends and acquaintances about “technology” and “computers” is (yes,) keeping track of passwords. I cringe inwardly when I see users with notebooks full of passwords, crossed out and scribbled over repeatedly. There is an better, tidier and secure method. Quite simply, you have a phone or a computer. Use them to do the work for you. 1Password is a superb solution to this password maintenance issue. It’s easy to use and gives you peace of mind that your passwords are as secure as you can make them.  I’ve tried other password storage applications to see what they offer and although the others I’ve tried are good, there is nothing I’ve tested that deals with password security and storage as well as 1Password. A little research and reading of reviews will show you that it is almost always the first recommendation of the reviewer. I use it along with Apple’s Keychain and find the two work very well together.  It’s all about security. I frequently follow various articles on general password maintenance and security from AgileBits and I’ve always found valuable information therein. I often go back to them to see what has changed since I last read them.  AgileBits has great online help and support. I also recommend a book “Take Control of 1Password” by Joe Kissel if you would like a guide to help you with 1Password. For travellers, check out Travel Mode, the ability of 1Password to protect your 1Password data from unwarranted searches. It’s ideal for business people who have access to certain keys, services, or any sensitive information and can’t afford to take any risks with others seeing those things. One more thing. 1Password was founded in Canada.",CA

Getting the extension to work in Firefox did not work right away and this is where 1Password's customer support really shined.  Within a couple hours (or less) I had a reply that solved the problem post haste--I was up and running on Firefox.  And what a joy it was to just click on auto fill in 1Password for the login information--no more typing long passwords and hoping there wasn't a typo.  They also extended my trial period so I could have enough time on Firefox to evaluate the software--that is good customer service!

When I upgraded from version 6 to version 7, the excellent instructions allowed me to migrate the passwords to my computer, iPad and iPhone in less than 5 minutes. The few times I've asked a question, customer service has been quick and outstanding. I like to live a 'minimalist' lifestyle, so I subscribe to very few app's. 1Password is most definitely an essential app and well worth the small monthly fee to keep my sensitive data secure.",US

However, I needed to switch to an app with better multiple platform support without losing currently-in-used features. I had three criteria in mind: 1) Security, 2) Ease-of-use 3) Multi-platform support.  1Password exceeded all my requirements.  It provides features that I am used to and then some.  It worth mentioning that I was impressed by their support.  Short of having a phone line—in which they do not; and I wish they had—I received prompt emails with useful relevant responses within couple of hours.",US

I've found their security to consistently stay up-to-date with the times and their features to consistently provide a better user experience. Their blog is also worth reading as they explain a lot of security concepts in terms easy for a lay person to follow and it can help you improve your personal, digital security. I highly recommend 1Password and it is the go to password manager for me and my family. (It's so easy my children can use it) Well worth the manageable subscription fees.",NL

Fortuntately I reached out to them and worked with their customer service (THANK YOU ASHLEY!) who worked with me what seems like HOURS (it wasn't really - but emails back and forth) to get me to where I needed to be because I wasn't doing the things I needed to.  They really took the time to make sure I got it right and that was incredible.  I am all set up on my phone and browser now which is such a relief! This is amazing in the time where people are replaced by chatbots.  I cannot recommend them enough for the application itself and if you need help - YES! ALL THE STARS!,US

This time Intan replied right away.  After several more e mail exchanges, I got version 7 working perfectly and it is a huge leap forward from the older one.  I can't thank Jason and Intan enough for the amount of time they spent helping me (a 72 year old retired, not so computer savvy, Cdn Forces vet). I salute their patience, professionalism and courtesy.  I highly recommend 1Password 7.  Ken",US

Yes it's a paid plan but the sync is great and secure, the native Mac app is great (the keyboard shortcut with the invisible login plus authenticating via touch ID is great)  and the Android app is great too. The ability to store TFA codes is great too, by definition it's a bit insecure having synced/non-local two factor, but for ease of use... it's just that extra step.  At one point I had an issue with Android not suggesting logins for browsers straightaway, so I emailed support expecting them to get back to me in a week... had a reply 30 mins later, and after a few back-and-forths it was sorted within an hour of my initial email. So quick! Her name was Amber and she was great. Toootally recommend. Love it!",GB
