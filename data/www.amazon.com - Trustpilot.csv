Some supplied directly by Amazon, some by suppliers. But just as Amazon as a company. Your delivery drivers always come on the day they say they will. I appreciate that alot. I also appreciate the fact that when one of your drivers cannot find my house that they contact me and make sure they do. Sometimes your drivers leave a parcel on my doorstep when I'm not in and there are lots of hiding places here. So it would be better if they hid it and sent a picture like DPD. Sometimes they do move them out of view. But compared to Evri - you are winning. Your drivers deliver and I appreciate that now. In fact I'd say I took delivery drivers delivering for granted. Not anymore. Also- the couple of times I have had big problems, your employees have sorted it. 1. Being charged tax on an expensive item that did not advertise there would be tax on the listing coming from abroad (they said all tax was included). You fixed it and the bill was sorted. 2. My child spent over £1000 on game tokens when he got hold of my device and your refunded me. It took a while and a couple of attempts to sort out, but you did it. 3. I had signed up accidentally to a prime feature without realising. You saw I hadn't used it and refunded me in whole. No problem.

I spoke to a supervisor By the name of Berna and she assured me that this problem would be resolved. But it wasn't. Today I got a delivery sitting at my front door on the ground, not in the Box. The irony is The Box and the sign for the deliveries Which specifies"" Amazon UPS USPS fedex please put packages in the Box""was purchased From Amazon. These drivers don't care if the packages are safely delivered they only care about meeting their deadline and getting off work on time. The crazy thing about it is UPS fedex USPS and even Walmart all delivered to the Box. Amazon driver's are the only ones who will not put my packages in the Box.",US

I have been lied to on at least four occasions and have still not had a refund. I ordered two items on the 17/11/2022 to be sent to the hub for me to collect. I had an email to say that the items could be lost so I asked for a refund but only one item was refunded. The item not refunded was a voucher for a Christmas present when I called to ask why it had not been refunded they told me the voucher had been redeemed. I informed them that I could not have redeemed it because I never got an email with a barcode and number to collect it from the hub. I have asked them to send me a copy of the email if they were so sure I had the gift card but they have promised me refunds and to look into it and do nothing. If this is the route Amazon is going to go down with this shambles of a customer service team then they are going to loose a lot of business.,GB

Fast forward to today, the day before I needed to receive it. The item never shipped. When I called, they again, gave me the run around and told me that the reason it didn't ship was because the item was shipping from a third party company that was shipping the item from China. Which basically meant I was screwed out of my order..  when I asked to speak to a supervisor, she then gave me the run around again and told me that the item was out of stock and they couldn't issue a credit to the order until after January 7th, which was after the day of should've shipped.

To cut the story short I updated the cover some 3 weeks ago now. The front cover was done overnight. I was told by Amazon that the second photo when you view my book on amazon.com, being that of the back cover will be updated in 10 business days.  Ten business days were up on Friday 12-23-22. Excluding the two holidays that followed, I called back some 15 actual business days later and was told someone would call back within two business days. Not only was the cover never updated in the time frame and still hasn't been, no one has ever called me back. My second point to this review is their customer service. The last item that I had delivered the idiot driver left my package at the wrong house and not realizing this at the time I even stopped the driver as he left our premises and he said, ""Oh another driver will be by later, probably with your package."" When I realized an email had come through, the photograph showed that my package was exactly where he had delivered it on the premises a few doors away from my own. I've also noticed when you clearly explain something to one of these foreign agents over the phone when they reply it's as if they've not even listened to a word that you've said. UPDATE: Thursday 1-12-23. A lady called Shakero (sp) called me back today from the KDP department at Amazon per my request. I explained to her that we are now on 22 business days when I was told the back book cover would be updated within '10 business days.' I also explained to her that when I spoke to Andre on Tuesday 1-3-23 he said that someone would call me back from the KDP department within '48 hours.' I said to her that was 216 hours ago and no one has ever called me back. When I was done explaining everything the call was still connected and I constantly said 'hello' and no one ever spoke back. When I try to request a call again from Amazon this is what you get and this is how ridiculous this company is: '''You have already submitted a phone or chat contact request within the last few minutes. Please wait a few minutes before sending another to allow the next available agent to connect with you.""""""",US

Hence the import fee deposit erroneously was lost upon import registration when reaching EU borders. Amazon admits the error but refuses to refund the deposit. After almost a year now of complaining to the (sadly redundant) Amazon CS, all we get is a 'promotional code'. Meaning that in order to get our deposit back in some odd way we must buy more stuff from Amazon (can you believe that !?!) This is dead wrong: 'Deposit' means deposit - it's not a future promise to mandatorily spend the full amount at Amazon or else get nothing. And it gets more ugly: At the same time Amazon has completely banned our EU-based account from completing any more orders from their US-site. That is: We can't order anymore from the very US Amazon-site that our promotional code has been granted for. And the promotional code can't be transferred to Europe or any other Amazon-site either we're told: Catch 22! This may seem clever or even logical from an Amazon perspective. But we strongly disagree. This way Amazon effectively is stealing from us. Under the pretty name of 'promotional code' Amazon is defacto acting as thieves by simply keeping our deposit and further making it impossible to reclaim the ’promotioal code’ Amazon themselves have facilitated.  Hence our deposit is now lost due to an error Amazon acknowledge to have full responsibility for. But Amazon refuse to remedy the mistake they’ve made in an ethical and morally adequate and responsible manner. Amazon are acting as simple thieves! They don't respect customers anymore.",DK

198,www.amazon.com,2023-01-08T14:24:25.000Z,1,This is a completely true and accurate…,"This is a completely true and accurate review of the local Amazon distribution center in Rochester, NY. For the past 2 years I have been trying to get Amazon to follow the delivery directions which are set in big bold writing on my address. It says 2 different times “DO NOT LEAVE ANYTHING ON THE PORCH.” It says it a second time at the end of the directions.  This concept is very simple. Drive, read directions, and deliver the packages. I also list on the directions to use the Amazon sold and backed MyQ delivery so they temporarily have access to the garage to put packages in.  I also have listed the garage code for them. Not 1 time has Amazon correctly delivered a package in the past 2 years. They have something called Amazon Key. I am also signed up for that where you click this button when you place the order and once again they are supposed to follow their own feature they advertise. It was the final straw the other day when  had a $197 order broken up into several deliveries. The delivery directions have not changed. In the middle of a rain storm, pouring down rain this driver I watched through the security camera place 2 packages in the pouring down rain on my porch which does not protect the electronics inside which were part of my order. I have sent emails to corporate leadership, called them for 2 full years every singe time they place my items on the porch and I have yet to receive a response. The night it happened I was fuming. I called Amazon 5 different times, explained what happened to each and every representative I spoke to.  Why you ask I had to tell it to so many people? Well because each and every one of these employees (all in countries all over the world) is because in the 2 hour conversation I had with each supervisor I would explain everything again, be on the phone with them hearing them typing in the background and when they realize how many times I have called about this; each and every one of them hung up on me.  IT WAS NOT A “DISCONNECT” 4 DIFFERENT TIMES. IT WAS A HANG UP BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WANT TO DEAL WITH IT. The thing that pissed me off the most was that not one supervisor/manger/specialist or whatever you want to call them; NOT A SINGLE PERSON I TALKED TO SOME FOR OVER 45 MINUTES EACH (BEFORE GETTING HUNG UP ON) TOOK ANY NOTES FOR THE MEXT REPRESENTATIVE TO READ. So I had to repeat myself 5 different times, to 5 different employees and in the end, the last representative I spoke with who claimed to get everything correctly after 2 hours and 21 minutes got everything wrong on which items were damaged and needed to be returned. I have requested Amazon leadership to listen to the tapes from that night. They know which one. Listen for yourself and be embarrassed for the way you treat your customers.  The employees at Amazon have a motto - “Earth’s most customer-centric company”and they go on to say that the customers are their greatest treasure.” Then why do you hang up on customers and do everything I have described above? Local Amazon logistics center in Rochester, NY - DO YOUR JOBS AND LISTEN TO YOUR CUSTOMER FOR A CHANGE. Answer our emails, and for God’s sake, never leave packages anywhere other then what the customer has indicated on their preference. AND NEVER HANG UP ON YOUR CUSTOMERS! So I am calling out the Distribution center at 326-290 Clay Rd, Rochester, NY 14623.  *** This is in no way reflecting the local employees who work in the warehouse itself. It is referring to the drivers and the main customer service headquarters in Seattle ***",US

After id been online constant for over 4hours being palmed off to next agent she pleaded with me to stay on and she would make it right. So took 5 hours in total but she did true to her word as I found on waking up this morning so she deserves a raise but the rest of the team CS And Co can rot. And I've well and truly been put off buying other items I had intended too  OMG LAST UPDATE 10 January.. so today it said the final package which is late had been delivered it has not and when I looked on the site theres a photo of it dumped on some rusty metal steps no idea where.. so used chat. Where another Indian rep come on. I explained the situation and obviously the photo proof its been dumped somewhere they asked did I wamt a refund or it replaced. I said replaced as they sent out the matching ikini top too which is pointless and wouldn't been ordered without the bottoms. I explained I go away beggining of February though  so need it before then obviously that gives them 3 weeks. I then seen theyd put a replacement to comeout but for the 6th of February when I'm away!! They said they couldn't send it any sooner .  I said if I'm being refunded it needs to be on top on bottoms. Next thing I recheck and theyve removed sending out the replacement bottoms and on top instead of issuing a return label for the bikini top so I can be refunded theyve spitefullly sent label for the bottoms which they know weren't delivered.  Luckily I screenshotted their botched delivery Before You guessed it they removed that photo proof.. absolute scammers!!! Im going to have to contact back and go through charge back process. PLEASE PLEASE AVOID AMAZON.COM the usa site at all costs its a absolute disgrace now. The chat service is disgusting. They are theives amd con artists and care nothing for ripping you off. Ive had no reply from the CEO.. thats it for me im deleting amazon. I PLEAD WITH ANYONE NOT TO GO THROUGH THIS. THEY ARE A TERRIBLE SCAM COMPANY NOW.. just looked back at chat & Sahil has deleted the entire conversation they had with me.  This company is full on fraud UPDATE On top of them not delivering order in 1 package as requested but 3 seperate ones on first order.. Ive just gone through my bank to find theres been a unidentified charge made by them for £26. Everything i bought has been accounted for in charges so now I'm going to have to contact fraud squad of bank. As there Indian chat representative hasn't even replied to me in 10minutes!!!. Stay far away from the USA site. UK is not this bad I recieved a email off amazon saying payment declined and click link when I went through your link site had changed to Spanish also my order 113-7024670-4733004 has reverted back to currency usd even though I selected your gbp option which is in reciept and came to £72 there is nothing wrong with card selected it has all the money in and has Not been declined by my bank. Also in your trouble shooting you say there should be a retry payment button next to order but there isn't one there just options to change card or delivery pace etc. I have tried adding a new card and selected for that order as theres no reason it should be declining this is obviously on your end so can you please contact me back. 9 have since downloaded app and used chat 2 have 2 Indian name agents pass me off. In fact tge 2nd just left the chat without responding his name was Vidhay.  All I wanted was for someone to retry payment while I was there theres no reason they shouldn't do this. I only have 24hour hours or you'll cancel my order. VIDHAY Tried coaxing me into cancel & reordering which I declined as item price increase now. Tbh im starting to think this is why YOU'RE declining payment as theres no problem with my bank the problems your end and others have had the same problem. I think its disgusting none of your Agents well help and just left me hanging.  I promise if this doesn't work or is corrected I will cancel ALL my other orders and ones just payed for as payment went through on others I will just cancel them and delete amazon unless someone resolves this Regards Josephine evans,GB

Waited three weeks for a delivery then on delivery date: (we are sorry but we ran into an issue) ??  I’ve heard that same excuse again and again.

You can’t actually get to speak with a human over a phone and that’s because it’s maybe easier to lie over live chat and come across as truthful?? Utter garbage operation feeding customers lies and the sooner you get exposed the better it will be for customers who are paying your wages.  It’s never ending with your rubbish service and I’ve heard your lies for the last time and listen closely Amazon when I say time because your on borrowed.

201,www.amazon.com,2022-12-28T16:16:00.000Z,1,Terrible problem solving tactics/solutions,"I'm majorly annoyed with Amazon. I live in a apartment complex with 11 buildings, total. And recently it became a problem that Amazon drivers deliver to the wrong buildings, and I have no access to the hallways of any of the other buildings, unless a friendly tenant let's me in. We usually scope the neighborhood and try to figure out if we can retrieve the parcel, with help of the ""evidence photo"" provided by the drivers. Sometimes we're lucky, other times not so much, and we have to reach out to Amazon's customer service. Usually they are willing to fix the mistake or at least give us a refund, but this time got really ridiculous. After we couldn't retrieve the package, we used the live chat function and essentially they told us, they parcel shows as delivered at the right address and there is nothing they can do. So we called the next day, and they once again told us there is nothing they can do, and it's our responsibility to ensure that the given address is a secure location... it would have been, if Amazon actually delivered to the correct address! In the end we got hung up on twice, by very rude personal. We had explained that the fault lays on Amazon, and we could prove it even, with the photos provided by the drivers (not all hallways look the same, different door mats, colors of apartment doors and so on), but they didn't want to hear any of it. Not only are we out of $40 now, additionally this is just going to continue, because clearly Amazon is not willing to inform their drivers of repeated misdeliveries.

Even if the customer suffers because of the spam seller. We ordered a product and waited for it over a month to get delivered, even on the app it was showing that it is on the way to get delivered. After a month when the product didn't get delivered we called amazon like so many times they at the end informed the seller is a spam and they cannot do anything about it. We just got the refund that's it. But what we will do with the refund. We ordered the product during sale. And now we will have to give full price for the product. Is it our fault that amazon has the spam seller listed on their app? Even they are not giving us any kind of concession. Really pathetic and bad experience with amazon.

263,www.amazon.com,2022-12-23T20:54:50.000Z,1,"Amazon, NOT the Grinch, Stole Christmas","Amazon, not the Grinch, stole Christmas.  Amazon relies heavily on outsourcing to the North Pole, with 3rd party Santa's elves which is ineffective because they don't empower those elves to resolve issues to their customer's satisfaction.  I placed this order over a week ago so my loved one would receive it for Christmas.  I work a demanding job at a hospital, which is why I ordered from Amazon online.  I find out last minute through tracking the gift that it was shipped back to the seller (which is Amazon), due to minor damage of the packaging, which I don't believe.   Amazon didn’t notify me via email or even offer any form of compensation in time for Christmas.  UPS noted they attempted delivery but didn't.  The recipient of the gift (which was already paid for), should be allowed to inspect the packaging/gift and make the determination of whether or not to accept it.  The recipient was never given that opportunity.  Apparently, the UPS Driver arbitrarily made that determination.  I made a call to Amazon and was told the gift would be redelivered by 12/24/22, which was not true, and they knew it.  So, basically, they insult customers by pacifying them with lies to get them off the phone.  That was followed by an email stating if my loved one didn't receive their gift by 12/27/22, to contact Amazon using their chat platform and the bot will quickly fix the problem or connect me with someone who can. Really???  How badly do they treat their staff that they can get and retain proper people?  Who has time for this?  I called again for clarification and the second representative gave me a number for UPS, as if I have nothing better to do, instead of sending a replacement ASAP.  They are taking the approach that this is my problem and my fault.  That is the equivalent of giving customers the middle finger and telling them to go F their self.  I was instructed to reorder the gift and that it would not arrive in time for Christmas.  Why would I do that?  Isn't once enough?  Don't assume your customers are stupid or desperate.   It’s sloppy and unacceptable for Amazon and UPS to cause inconvenience last-minute during Christmas.  Why didn’t they coordinate with their shipping partners and sellers (in this case Amazon is the seller) in order for a replacement to be sent timely?  Shipping is at the very core of their business, and they are a big organization that makes millions if not billions of dollars with a network of options, not a new company that is scratching their heads still trying to figure it out.  Don't they have a contingency plan in place for these issues during the holidays?  This should be a simple fix for something they do all day every day.  I don't work for Amazon, yet they're making me work because I made the mistake of placing my trust in them when I placed that order.  Being sorry for inconveniencing me doesn't cut it.  I doubt it's the first time a package got damaged in the process of delivering it, if indeed that’s what happened. I don’t believe them. In retrospect, because it's Christmas, and everyone is understaffed, they are overwhelmed with orders, deliveries, lack of storage space for the items, truck broke, a dozen scenarios could've occurred.  A disclaimer on their website to that effect would have helped to serve as a reminder to busy folks in advance so they could've made other arrangements in time.  UPS said that they have an agreement with Amazon that if a package is damaged, they are to send it back. The item arrived at the UPS facility in Raleigh NC, where they would have inspected it for damages before giving it to driver.  According to the tracking notes it was given to driver, which can only mean that something must have happened enroute to the recipient or delivery was never done.   I also noticed Amazon took the liberty of charging the Amazon credit card on file, since there was an issue with the pre-selected one, without notifying me first, so I couldn't make the necessary correction, which is poor communication on their part.  They can find a way to get customer's money but not a way to get the gift delivered in time. I was told their system didn't allow them to send a replacement.  I asked why? They had no clue. They have gotten too big to deliver proper service.  Growth is priority over customer satisfaction.  They failed at following through.   They cost me in time and money.  I work hard and deserve to rest on my only days off but instead of relaxing I am stressing, spending precious time resolving this issue which isn't fair.   How is dealing with Amazon a satisfying experience during a major holiday?  They basically could care less at meeting simple expectations.  I was told about their policies.  Really?   Remind me, why I should continue supporting a business that can’t fulfill their obligations?  The Grinch can't compete with Amazon.  Coal in Bezo's stocking!",US

Think twice before you buy off Amazon!! Ask for a delivery PIN. I and my husband are both solicitors. I ordered 9 items from Amazon recently in 2 orders. I received an email when I was at a hotel I had arrived at for the weekend stating that my items had just been delivered and handed to resident - no photo- in three packages. Given I wasn't there that was impossible. I asked my neighbour who is a doctor if she had them. She didn't. I then asked her if she would mind having a look to see if the parcels were outside our gate or thrown over it. They weren't. No parcels anywhere. I rang Amazon immediately and asked them to resend. They said I had to wait three days - that they had instigated an investigation and the parcels hadn't been delivered and I needed to wait and call again on Tuesday in case they had been delivered by then. This is despite me explaining that it was often the case that parcels delivered on a Saturday weren't and that I would re-order the items because they hadn't been delivered and I knew from past experience that they wouldn't turn up. I rang on Tuesday and asked for a refund. I was told a refund would now be instituted but it would take another three day investigation before it was actually instituted and that I could call back on Friday but didn't need to as an email would be sent confirming the refund. I rang again today Friday and was told something about how they had never said there was more than one three day investigation. I pointed out they record their calls. Then I was told to call back tomorrow. Saturday. and I could ask for a refund then as the three day investigation would be finished. When I pointed out that given I rang last Saturday this was now a six day investigation I was told I had to go to the police. To file a report for stolen items. Which of course I said I can't because I never received them. That this is there problem. A complete failure of contract.  I then received an email repeating this and saying I also have to take it up with the carrier. Their carrier. No details of course. And they have the contract with the carrier not me. This is a complete failure of consideration on their part and they want to make it my problem and not give me my money back.  I have now taken this matter up with my credit card company instead who have refunded me the money. Amazon have no proof the packages were delivered - handed to resident. I have proof - from a doctor and two solicitors and a hotel - that the packages weren't delivered - handed to resident - or otherwise.

The “try before you buy” customer service department never assisted me for the refund after being transferred to them at least 3 times and speaking with 3 different agents. I finally pressed and the last agent said, “yes…Amazon received the shoes you returned.” BUT- the refund will take 14 business days. What!!?? She also said in a subsequent email that “if your refund is not received by Jan 6 (2023), to write them.” My trust for Amazon is fading.

Company Lied About Refund Processing.,"I have been an Amazon customer for the better part of two decades, most of that time being a subscriber to their Prime service. Up until now I have always had satisfactory service when and if having to deal with customer care.  I ordered an upholstered queen size headboard on December 10th, 2022, which was supposed to arrive by UPS on December 19th. On the 19th I was given notice that an item had arrived at my residence. When I arrived home, there was no such item. I contacted customer care a total of four times that evening and was told numerous things. First, I was told that “carriers will mark an item down as delivered even if the item has not arrived yet.” I found that to be a very misleading statement to make, and one that does not fall under the realm of professional business practice. If an item has not yet arrived, why on earth would it be marked down as delivered?  I was then asked to wait 24 hours until the following day, Tuesday December 20th 7pm EST specifically, because sometimes items arrive late. I was told that if it hadn’t arrived by that time, that a refund would be issued to me. On Tuesday December 20th I re-contacted customer care three more times in an attempt to let them know that I STILL had not received my paid for item. I was not given a refund as had been stated to me the previous day, instead I was told simply to “file a police report”.  In addition to filing that report, I also filed a report with the Better Business Bureau for the completely shady way that this situation was handled, and the run-around that I was given.  It is now Thursday, December 22nd and I am still without the item that I had paid for, as well as out of the money used to purchase the item.  I have discontinued my Amazon Prime membership and will not be shopping through this company any longer.",US

They take your money but don't deliver when the item is released. In my case it was a book.  I contacted their customer support but the kind person could only tell me that the book in question was not in stock. On Amazon US it is in stock though, yes I bought from another Amazon domain.  I would think that pre-orders are collected and when Amazon is able to order the book at the factory, they would order the amount of pre-orders and some extra copies. It looks like that is not the case. In fact, Amazon can not give exact dates to when the item would be in stock. So, it could be possible a pre-order itme will never arrive, but the money is gone.  Bad service which impact the reliability of Amazon. I am not sure if I want to pre-order ever again from them. Only thing is, If I want the book in question a.s.a.p. I have to cancel my pre-order and order again for a price 2,5 times higher then before with a reseller on Amazon, not Amazon self. Amazing that Amazon is operating this way. Not putting any value towards their customers whatsoever.",NL

I shut off auto-renew due to other problems 6 months or so earlier.  I noticed they were displaying the $119.00 annual fee in my account and so i thought they were extending an offer at the old rate to keep a customer.  It's not like Amazon is reaching new heights right now and it may get worse.  So, today I check and see they charged me $139.00 + tax = $148.00. I call up, explain, get put on a brief hold so the rep could research it.  30 seconds later they disconnect the call and no call back.  So, I cancel the membership and then I get an email saying to look for a refund of $136.00 in the 3-5 days.   OK, they need every penny they can get - I get it.  They can keep the credits for the digital services for accepting delayed shipping.  I never had an item shipped in 1 day.  Maybe 2 items tops ever came in 2 days.  All the rest took their time.   Silly annoying stuff, and then you can't get an ear long enough to get things straightened out.  I'll make out alright without placing many orders on Amazon going forward.

I've had a rough year, been in the hospital 3 times and the second time had my right leg amputated below the knee. Bought all the hardware from Amazon. Wheelchair, walker, house ramp and then a second walker. These people need to realize we are people too. I'm very disappointed in Amazon at the moment.

I ordered an alternator for my car on approximately December 8th 2022. When I received the package it was the wrong item. I contacted Amazon they tried to act like I was pulling a fast one. I sent them pictures. I don't have a printer they sent ups for the label sent package back. Amazon will not assist with refunds I spoke to over 15 Representatives including supervisors. No help at all. Told I have to wait 30 days for refund. Looks like UPS has now lost my return. Contacted Amazon again I was told again wait 30 days no help will be provided now. I am disabled had to buy the alternator got wrong items so had to buy another alternator from Amazon. Had to pay more for mechanic my mechanicus went out of town now. Amazon has cost me over $250 on this deal. They used to give promo codes they told me I have used too many but this is their fault. They give them when they are in the wrong which has been quite often lately. Now they're acting like I am a thief. They gave the promo codes not my fault and I should get another one for this deal but they will not assist in any way at all they even hang up the phone on me. I'm tired of dealing with representatives from out of the country they put people on the phone that do not speak or understand English will only to frustrate the customer. They say they have new policies well guess what these new policies stink. I am stuck now at the Christmas holidays cannot buy additional Christmas presents because I do not have the money back I am told to wait 30 days unbelievable. Then I have to wait additional time for it to get back to my bank if they even provide a refund. I've been treated rudely by the representatives and by their executive office. Executive office told me if I call about this problem again they will not respond to it. Again wait 30 days. This is the worst service I have ever received. Being a disabled person I do not work but I am forced to call many many hours on the phone because people don't speak proper English to be understood all the time I was forced to call back many hours I should be getting paid for this. Amazon is not the company they used to be. They're only out for themselves they don't care about the customer anymore is what I am experiencing. I am going to talk to an attorney I am also going to shop much less with them tell my friends and family and hopefully they will eventually be the good company that used to be if not they are not too big to go out of business if they keep treating customers bad this is what will happen.,US

When I insisted I wanted to speak to someone higher up, a supervisor came on the phone who was extremely rude and said we didn’t send any email advising me to order a new tablet which Amazon would refund.  When I told her the date and time of the email and the person who sent it - she said she can’t help me and put the phone down.

In early November I ordered a chromebook laptop on Amazon that was sold by Holiday Gifts Express. A couple of days later it was obvious this chromebook was defective, so I requested a return which was approved. I ordered a replacement on Amazon.. this time sold by Amazon. I had trashed the original box, so I used the replacement box to ship the defective chromebook back to the seller. I was shocked by the seller's response.. false accusations and said they were going to report me to law enforcement for mail fraud! Said their decision was final, and wouldn't even respond to my follow-up messages. I'm surprised this seller is part of Amazon.. they should be terminated. I then submitted a claim through Amazon's A-to-Z Guarantee. This process is a joke and a waste of time. So now I have the replacement chromebook from Amazon that works fine. The seller.. Holiday Gifts Express.. has the defective chromebook and is keeping my money. Lesson learned. From now on I will only buy products that are sold and fulfilled by Amazon. Never from a third-party seller.",US

I understand, that mission of Amazon, is to fail you customers every time, all the time. However your customer DISSERVICE has really crossed a line. You should have not done it. As you may be aware, there has been an ongoing case for a fake issue gift card by your company This has been going for one year. Only yesterday 10th November 2022, you have officially recognized, that selling fake part is part of the way they work as testified by the Email from November 10th 2022 On the date 27th August 2022, I called for the 10th time, your “customer disservice teams” to get an update, on where we were on the Gift card issue. As my own experience has proved, that the customer service is useless, I asked to talk directly to the Supervisor. That “Supervisor” wanted to identify myself and asked for my name I told my name: Andrea. After hearing that, he denied any further support and denied identification, given that: “Andrea is a female name, and I had a male voice” I could not believe to my ears, so I told him, I pretended not to have heard that and to find a better excuse. He kept insisting that I was not the account holder because I was a male and Andrea is a female name On top of the never-ending ignorance, your “Supervisor” took the decision to SEXUALLY discriminate me based on my race and voice (the whole educated world, knows, who is called Andrea in Italy) Immensely shocked by what I was hearing ( and your company recording), I asked him to provide me immediately his name and his ID number. Aware, we could identify him, he refused. I closed the call and sent an email to Amazon. As it is always the case, the Email was ignored. This is all they answered and ignored any further request for clarification We're contacting you about your recent interaction with our Customer Service team. After further review, we determined that your communication with our Customer Service Associate was inappropriate and not in agreement with the Amazon.com Conditions of Use. On 29th September I opened a formal complaint in the Business Bureau. As expected, you are pretending not to know anything about the case and went into silence Radio and did not even begin the investigation that a normal company would do – see below.

Regards, Mohammed Amazon.com As you can see from the document below, this is not the first time, that Amazon uses this sexual harassments and discrimination towards employees, but now they are also extending to customers. As a result I am asking Amazon, to refund me of the amount I am suing you for as part of this case.

So very soon after making this order through amazon I gone ahead and cancelled the order and also went to contact the customer service to explain what happened and cancel it, amazon customer service reassured me that no money will be taken from my bank account and that the order is successfully cancelled and I can go ahead and reorder the items that there simply was not an option to just change the address, when reordering the exact same items I was angry to find out that the total would end up being about a 100USD higher! I had to change some items but still ended up having the order total higher about 613USD I successfully created the order to a new address being the company Cayo Cargo that will deliver me the items to Belize mid January. I had just enough money on my bank account to cover the order I made but what ended up happening was that MANY pre authorized transactions AND charges started to appear on my bank account half of which were unrelated to my current order and half of which were double charges for my current order those transactions absolutely drained my balance and my current order was not being shipped and stated that it has not been paid despite my bank account being billed over 700USD already! I had to contact amazon customer service about this about 15 times spoke to 20 different people and spend over 8hrs total calling and chatting, for the most part the people I spoke or chatted to were absolute imbeciles, didn't understand English properly, or were just lying to me, everyone kept giving me false and different information than the previous person! I contacted my bank the same way and in the end things got sorted out by Asha from credit card payments team of amazon, who was the one first person that actually understood and helped me with my problem, she provided the proper confirmation email and my bank reversed the incorrect payments so that eventually only the correct payments gone through and been deducted from my balance to cover the order so that the last items got shipped HOWEVER VERY DELAYED DUE TO THAT! I haven't received any compensation or anything for all of these problems encountered, now due to this amazon problem my family will not have Christmas as all the gifts will arrive late, if amazon didn't charge my account so many wrong transactions in the first place then my order would be delivered on time for Christmas delivery to my home in Belize! I demand a financial compensation for this as I would hate to take the screenshots recorded voice calls and put them on social media to make everyone aware of how incompetent amazon is, and to take it to the court as well, I have a very influential company of lawyers both in the UK and US as I do not allow anyone to treat me improperly unfairly or illegally,",BZ

I discontinued Prime in July 2022 when my annual fee came up as I could no longer justify the fee which seemd to keep going up on a regular basis.    I had to try  twice to escape Prime.    The first time I was under the impression that Prine was cancelled only to see a few day later that I man still under Prime.   The second time I managedd to make it stick which is a challenge in its own right.    October I am again under Prime and I had not knowingly subscribed.    I contacted support.   Amazon used to have great support but no longer.   It was down to a chat which i personally dislike.   It took 4 different individuals over nearly 1.5 hours to finally get confirmation that Prine was canelled and that the fees taken without my consent would be reversed.    I asked for  an email confirmation of the process as I was not keen on repeating it.   I was assured that an email would be forthcoming.    NO EMAIL CONFIRMATION OF THE CANCELLATION AND REVERSAL OF FEES.  Three days later I checked my account to see that I am still  a proud Amazon Pirme subscriber.   5 days later I check my bank account and there is no reversal of fees.

They will simply drag it out until I get fed up and go away. I will NOT. I have now contacted Amazon for help. They state that they have me covered on some A to Z policy, and would sort it out and get it cleared up.

I once spent 30 minutes trying to reach a live representative but the bots refused to connect me. I used to work in IT and I'm having trouble figuring out how to contact anyone. They make it as hard as possible to reach a live representative and their bots are designed to prevent you from accessing help. For such a large tech company its surprising that they don't solve problems before they begin. Instead of emailing you the return code, they send a confirmation email with a link, it takes a one step process and turns it into a 6 step process where you click the link, sign into your account, find the item, click three time to get the code. If you can't log in or lose cell reception you can't return the item. Stores do not have an ipad or other device to allow you to log ino your account. I haven't been able to return my items in two weeks due to a problem with the wifi connection at UPS. Tech is evolving but not with the pace that it needs to in order to replace real customer service. Their bots and chats don't work when you need them. They discourage you from getting help. Its not the worst service but there have been times where they absolutely refused to connect me to a live representative. Also, when you need to mail and item back, the labels do not print. In the past ten years they have not designed the return label to print normally on any device or printer. It prints too small or so large that you need two pieces of paper to print. Amazon won't help. The issue is not my printer or computer since both have been upgraded since I first experienced this issue.

As a Prime member I am expecting fast delivery times but I am very lucky if I get a parcel in 5 days let alone the advertised 2 days. But my main complaint is the FREE returns which it seems no longer applies even though its stated on most items pages. It now transpires that on a large number of items Amazon has recently instigated a $7.99 pick up fee when requesting a pick up via UPS, or you can drive to the local drop off point which for me would cost around $12 in gas. This happened to me recently on items that arrive inoperable or damaged and despite assurances from a customer service person that it does not apply to faulty items I am still being charged! You will also notice a huge increase in sponsored items as you search Amazon. It used to be infrequently you would see a few sponsored items on a page but now some pages have more than 50% . Amazon seems to have found another way to make Jeff even more $$. Fake reviews have always been an issue recently commanding the attention of news outlets like CNN. In Amazons efforts to curtail these paid for reviews they are now blocking or banning genuine reviews. When they block a review you get a message that states: Amazon is not accepting reviews for this item from this e-mail address... I enjoy giving great reviews for great products and probably have many hundreds of 4 or 5 star reviews and hope that it helps customers feel safe about buying certain products. But recently I received a  message saying my 5 star review on a certain product will not be accepted. I e-mailed the address given in the reply 3 times  as to why the review was not acceptable, no answer. Why add an e-mail address to request a reason for the decline when you are not going to answer?

Being that card transactions are not ACH, they never take more than 24 hours to attempt the charge... Unless I buy from Amazon. Amazon charges you once the shipping process has started, NOT when you place the order, meaning it can take several days to charge you after you place the order. This has been frustrating for me because I'll place an order, not be charged for days, then get an email that the order is delayed for card declining, then rerun the card, wait MORE days and have more delays just for the issue to repeat itself. This feature is an issue for me, but it's not the end of the world. I started a support chat to see if there was a setting I could change to be charged at the time of the order (or within a reasonable 24 hours of the order being placed) but the rep ""Marie Dee"" that I talked to just danced around my question, not giving me a solid yes or no and being very cold, and when I repeated my question that she hadn't answered she just left the chat.  It literally says in the chat transcript that she left the chat. I didn't curse, I didn't attack her or even the company, I was just pursuing an answer for what I thought was a pretty straightforward question and I guess she was frustrated that I wasn't accepting the canned macro script she was feeding me. I'm leaving a 2 star instead of 1 because I started up another chat immediately after with ""Himanshu"", who was kind and actually offered me a workaround. I can't change the charging time (time of order vs. time of shipping process beginning) if I use my debit card, BUT if I put the needed balance for the order on an Amazon gift card instead and use that for the purchase, I can avoid all the previous issues I've had and not worry about maintaining my checking balance for a charge that could come at any time.",US

I just got blocked from my own account with them.  They are playing games on customer service and their specialists. They are banning legit customers and making them wait a month or less to send a specialist email to regain access to their legit accounts.  You can no use gift cards that you legitly get from anywhere even their crap gift cards use too many legit cards that block your account. If that's the case then remove the fin' cards from their site.  Instead of traumatizing their customer thinking everyone is scamming them. They even had the nerve to make the first tier of their customer service not allowed to fix the issue.  Then you have to wait for a special craphead (specialist) to send you an email to regain access.  I am sure once you get it you have to waste more time by sending them proof that their crap fraud system is broken. This is what happens when you trust trash like Mark Zuck and Jef Bezos that drop their company to investors or sell to India customer support to show you how much they do not give to craps that you put 10 plus years into making them rich. Then they get mad when they get sued left and right.  They are about to have to settle out with me in a minute as well.  I am going to really hit their pockets hard.  I run my own e-commerce site and have never done this to my customers.  Never penalized the legit customer for them having bad coding skills in the fraud department. All that money was stolen from good people (customers) to get kicked or blocked from their own accounts.  Someone needs to really talk about jail time for crap sites like this.

So I've had to remove all my cameras, despite three working, pack them up and return. Amazon will probably bin them. A 25% refund or replacement add on camera, which they sell, would have sufficed.

It took me 5 minutes to do the Walmart thing, so I ended up buying my remote there. The problem was:  I had just moved, and had gotten a new phone # (landline). I couldn't access my account. I wasn't even able to open a new account. The main problem was that I don't have a cell phone (they want to leave you a text with a sign in code). They emailed me some kind of instructions that didn't work - From what I could see, if you have a new address, a new phone number (landline), and you don't own a cell phone, you are a second class customer and will not be able to access  any existing account or even open a new one.

Amazon converted me to annual subscription and charged upfront without any indication from me in any way whatsoever! Completely fraudulant behaviour. They just changed me to annual and charged me. THEN - it took me 3 phone calls to get my subscription cancelled and refunded and was spoke to incredibly rudely by their customer service who told me they wont help me if I dont remember the email address assigned with the account. The rude boy changed his tune when I asked to speak to a manager because I'm being spoken to like a criminal when I am trying to discuss my account using any other form of verification. The rude man then finally said he could see my details and he can help me with my refund. Which he pretended he did because 11 days later I had to call again and go through it all again. The app doeasnt allow changing email address associated with the account and they make it incredibly difficult to cancel and get a refund. I promise you Amazon are being sneaky with annual subscriptions as other companies are now doing. It's just adding difficult cust serv reps and changing you to annual subscription to try to get a push for money during the downturn. Don't say you werent warned it was a horrible experience!!!

745,www.amazon.com,2022-11-23T04:02:07.000Z,1,"This is a recent, genuine, unfortunate experience.","This is a recent genuine experience that repeats itself.  Today though, November 22, 2022, Amazon has pushed the boundary of what is and is not safe.  Amazon drivers represent the company and act upon with their desecration the manner in which they conduct their delivery practices.  I say this since we are repeatability experiencing like results occurring at different times of day, with different types of packages delivered, on different dates, with different drivers.  Considering the delivery results are all similar in nature, it is then assumed that the results experienced are based on the instruction and training that Amazon provides their employees.  When ordering, we provide instruction which defines how the packages are to be delivered.  We've filed many complaints with Amazon and their local field office with no positive results.   Amazon delivered the package at the door, the door they are required to deliver to.  They are explicitly instructed to place the item inside the door.   We are quite disturbed by what we discovered today.  This package delivered was leaning up against the door.  The package had ""heavy"" stickers on all sides of the box.  Since it was leaning up against the door, at the angle it was, it made it difficult to open the door, as it swings out.  The package was partially wedged between the base tread and the door.  The doors on the back of our building are emergency exits, fire exits.  With the heavy package up against the door, had there been and emergency, there could have very well been injuries that would have occurred.  These doors open very easily but not with a heavy Amazon package wedged between the door and the tread.   We have security footage of the driver placing the package up against the door. We took photos of the placement of the package when it was discovered.  The door was difficult to open.  This is a serious matter that Amazon is going to be dealing with.  A police report is being obtained and fully documented. Calling customer service is a sham.  We get an overseas call center.  Those people have no clue because these incidents we are experiencing here, are normal everyday happing’s over there.  They don’t understand and seem indifferent to what is being explained to them.  That makes it worse.  How many times will it take until something tragic happens due to the irresponsibility of Amazons poor employee training practices and their inability to implement positive change?

I had a delivery that I pre-ordered almost 2 months ago. Yesterday was the day of release. Did I receive it? NO. Instead, I got an email from Amazon telling me that delivery would be December 28. I cancelled the item immediately. Yesterday, I also had a $75 item out for delivery. All day long. Did I get it? NO. I looked at the tracking and saw that the Amazon driver took my item back to the processing center for absolutely no reason and I still don't have it. All Amazon says is ""There is a carrier delay"". That is not what I paid $140 a year to have Prime for. Amazon customer service? Non existent. Their automated thing insists on helping you and if you do get a human being, it is someone from India who reads from a prepared script. Literally every agent says the same thing. No disparaging the good people of India, but why will Amazon not hire American workers also? It is very difficult to understand what they type in the chat since they have little to no working knowledge of the English language? Amazon does nothing but LIE in their product descriptions. If the items are in stock, why not ship them instead of leaving my order sitting around to suddenly go ""temporarily out of stock"". The last thing I want to mention is that 60-70% of all collectible items I order arrive damaged. The shipping box is fine, its the merchandise that isn't. That means they purposefully put used or damaged merchandise in boxes to send out to customers as new. They will replace it if you have Prime. But if the second one is damaged also (which they usually are), they only offer a refund instead of another item. Which is fine, but I want the damn item. Yeah... Amazon SUCKS.",US

872,www.amazon.com,2022-11-10T09:51:04.000Z,1,Amazon are con merchants,"I took out Prime with Amazon, because I was under the impression, that by doing so you could get gaurenteed delivery.  I certainly found our the hard way that a delivery is far from guaranteed. I was looking to buy a new TV,  so after several hours of comparing specs, I decided I would go with a model made by Hisense. I added to my basket and made my way to the checkout, the item stated DELIVERY IN ONE BUSINESS Day, order day was Monday so that meant delivery Wednesday. Item was paid for. All good so far, or so I thought. Two hours later my delivery status changed to DELIVERY DATE PENDING.  Confused by this I telephoned amazon's customer service number, and got through to the call centre in the Philippines. After explaining why I had called, I was told the following. "" it doesn't mater what day it says delivery will be, when you place the order, as it's just an estimate and even then it's dependent on your postcode"". I contested that, as no where on the screen, as your processing the order does it state that. I was told "" well what I just told you is how it is"".  I then asked when will I get my order? to which I was told "" absolutely no idea as we're out of stock""  I said that's not right as when I placed my order it was stating in stock. It turns out that amazon sells more than they have stock of as it gets them a better discount with their suppliers. While I'm trying to sort this out, I then see that in less than an hour they are still selling my TV and stating next day delivery. I say to amazon shouldn't you fulfill the orders that are still waiting for a delivery before you take more orders,  they said "" oh no we don't do that,  you just have to wait till that supplier has stock again, and that could be days or weeks we don't know""  amazingly amazon couldn't understand why me the customer might be annoyed by this. Unfortunately it gets worse as amazon then said "" You cannot cancel your order or get your money back,  you just have to wait an indefinate amount of time with us Amazon holding your money"".  So I couldn't even cancel my order so I could place a new order to get a next day delivery from a supplier that could supply me with my tv. It gets interesting as I'm a fully trained Trading standards officer for UK trading standards. I pointed out to the customer service agent, that Amazon is actually breaking the law, as they are using misleading selling practices,  by using misleading advertising through promise of guaranteed delivery that is not actually guaranteed at all"" response from Amazon customer service agent was "" were Amazon we don't have to comply with UK trading standards law"" which of course they do. So I never got my order and UK trading standards will be taking action against Amazon. I put this on trust pilot, so that other members of the public, who are thinking of ordering from amazon,  don't end up in the same position I did.  Amazon think they are so big, they don't have to care about their customers, and can do anything they want.  Well as a fellow customer I'm here to tell Amazon you do have to care about your customers and you do have to operate within the law.  So fellow customers, think twice before ordering from Amazon, and if you can get your product some where else,  then do so and boycott Amazon. That's power to the people.",GB

916,www.amazon.com,2022-11-04T21:01:12.000Z,1,Declining Service and Quality Standards,"At one time, Amazon was an efficient, reliable and customer-focused organization. That being said, over the past 24 months, they have become one of the most unreliable and inefficient logistical/retail services I have ever dealt with.  Products take longer to arrive when compared to other retailers who don't charge an annual fee and delivery windows are often missed.  Customer service agents are based outside of North American and for the most part, are difficult to deal with and generally require further explanation and reiteration to resolve the most basic issues.  We have also noticed a steep decline in Amazon's streaming services including the quality and reliability of the content. Lastly, we have found Amazon's customer experience extremely poor. Streaming subscriptions that provided specific movies, that we have maintained for several years are no longer available and can only be ""purchased or rented"". This is extremely poor practice and given that it appears to be (primarily) the movies we have watched, I am inclined to believe that this is an intentional act to force us to buy these movies despite already paying for the subscription.  We will be canceling our Prime membership, along with all subscriptions in November when they raise the price.",CA

I really wanted to use their services so I didn't cancel the subscription, up until the moment I realized that their customer service and website were plain awful. I tried to get in contact with them and then with Amazon, in order to have the subscription cancelled and receive my refund. Eventually Amazon did the trick, but little did I know that at a distance of one year the subscription would turn out to be still active. In fact, I got another charge of 184.49 dollars on my bank account. An unauthorized charge which I disputed with my bank immediately. I wrote to the customer support from IMDB and Amazon again and they guaranteed that it was all a mistake, that the subscription would now be cancelled for real and a refund had just been issued. At a distance of 2 months and after several intense exchanges of e-mails, I still haven't received the money back on my account, nor any official pdf confirmation of the refund. Amazon, who owns IMDB, couldn't care less about the issue: all they did was try to pass the ball to IMDB, whose customer support is non-existent, or try to convince me that the refund had been done correctly and there was nothing more they could do. I even showed them the emails from my bank where it's clearly stated that no refund ever came through and that a pdf confirmation of the transaction is required in order to be credible, but - no matter how many times I tried to call them or contact them through the support chat - Amazon refused to acknowledge the problem or do anything to solve it. A problem which was caused by their utmost negligence towards the customer, in the first place. I have now proceeded to report both companies to the Federal Trade Commission, for fraud.",PL

There are many reasons why someone would want their personal information hidden, and that should be respected. Up until recently, Amazon appeared to be doing just that until the last 2 shipments, one in Sept 2022, which was somehow resolved by someone at Amazon and did not care to divulge how, and now with this Oct 2022 order & shipment (Order # 113-9983081-4700234). First, I was hung up on by the last Amazon CS agent. I know I kept calling, hours and hours of time, over 6 days, trying to figure out why the shipping on the order was so messed up. Sensing Amazon was behind this all along and confirmed by Amazon CS agent Colin M, I continued to press my case with no resolution, the shipment is still stuck in a DHL ""Clearance event"" (DHL tracking numbers: 5361362020 & 5361372052). Something is definitely wrong with the way Amazon has set up international shipping with DHL and maybe other carriers as well. All I know is from April 2020 to Aug of 2022 we never had an issue with shipments, using Amazon, from the US to Romania. And now we do. We checked the EU regulations and nothing changed that would affect our orders to Romania. Also, in the last month (Oct 2022) we have used other shipping companies besides DHL, using different online companies, rather than Amazon, with ZERO issues. Something stinks and it is coming from the halls of Terry Av N. We were told by Amazon, that there was nothing they could do. We were told by DHL.ro that Amazon needed to fix their waybill. In the meantime, I am out $250, my family is without the blankets and gifts I sent, the shipment is in limbo for however long ..., and all we can do is wait for DHL to send the shipment back to Amazon so I can get a refund? - if I can get a refund. Amazon is so huge, I doubt this will go anywhere. But I will post to as many sites as possible.",US

That day I looked up my order to obtain tracking information and noticed my order was cancelled, claiming that I refused delivery. I live by myself, work from home and there was no attempted delivery.  I called Amazon and spoke to an agent who said she would follow up with me the next day. The one time I stepped away from my phone is when she called and missed the call. I called them back and spoke to another agent who said they are trained to return the call 30 minutes later, so instead of explaining my story again, I said I would just wait for her to call back. She never called back.  I called Amazon again and spoke to a 3rd agent who put me on hold for 25 minutes and then the line dropped. She also never called back.  I waited a couple days and still nothing. So this morning I told my story to a 4th agent and she tells me she is going to escalate this to management and couldn’t tell me much of anything. I told her my only request is that I do not want the same delivery company to be used for any future deliveries going forward and I will not be making any Amazon purchases going forward until that is confirmed. She then tells me the delivery company has to mess up at least 3 times for them to consider this. By this point I’m irate and I’m not interested in possibly going through this experience again a 2nd or 3rd time and request to escalate the call.  This is where my experience gets even worse. The manager was completely uncaring, no empathy, unfriendly and expressed very little concern when I said that I would cancel my prime membership and close my account if my request wasn’t granted after all the hoops I had to jump with them. It was so triggering to me and I asked to speak with someone higher than him and he flat out said no. Did I curse and express how I felt about his “help”, yes. Should I have stayed calm? Yes but honestly I was just disappointed and upset by his lack of care and I disconnected the call.  I immediately went on the chat customer service to report my experience and the agent right away was empathetic and kind and helpful and filled out a carrier deprioritization form.

I have always purchased items from Amazon without any problems, but now feel vulnerable and unsupported by them, especially when buying items of higher value, a time when their assistance is cut off. In July, on prime day, I ordered and paid in full for a laptop and a phone (£479). I didn’t receive either items and after informing them nothing was done, no investigation, no refunded. Customer service initially accused me of ways being difficult customer, after hearing my confusion they quickly apologised and said their was a “genuine mistake”. This in itself was stressful, ontop of them still not will to resolve my situation. I feel let down, cheated and frustrated. It's unbelievable and I've now lost alot of money and time, with no good outcome. Now I firmly believe they just focus on money rather than their customers, having no empathy or motivation to help you when dealing with expensive purchases. I can see from each of you too, reading your experiences too!  It has been useless chasing them for months, just because I wanted my rights recognised.  Both the seller and courier were Amazon (not a third seller). I just received an empty box, just containing the laptop’s charger, no laptop, no phone and the email received thereafter was shown as delivered.  They haven’t been able to answer my question as to how they investigated this. They just asked me to provide a Police report which the Police said they couldn’t provide.  It has also been extremely frustrating trying to get in touch with Amazon’s call center, most of them are rude and disrespectful.

USPS claimed to have made an attempt to deliver, however, I know this to be false, especially since there was no slip indicating a delivery attempt was made place in my mailbox.  On top of that, the usps have never answered a call I ever made to the post office and the closest location is miles away. I am 7 months pregnant, I’m not shopping in stores because I am limited with lifting and carrying heavy items, which is why Amazon is my go to for these thing. Truly convenient, and allows me to avoid stores and large groups of people. But you really dropped the ball on this one.  I can’t get a refund from you guys yet because I have to receive the product and then ship it back first.  Which I never will because the package is too big for my mailbox, are you guys or the post office expecting my mailbox to grow overnight to accommodate the package size?  Or my next option is to go in person to the post office, which has limited hours, to reject the package and ask them to send it back to sender. Or wait until the 23rd of this month for the package to be deemed rejected and shipped back.  But in the meantime, I’m out over $100 and I don’t have the product that I need.

I live on Hollins mill lane and your dumb drivers from Rochdale post my products through a door on a different street I also live in an apartment on the second floor so it's reasonable to assume they never get through the security doors to be able to knock on my door.

The details are a bit mundane but here they are for completeness: The photo and description of an item listed on Amazon was the legal ""UK"" labelled sticker for a UK car numberplate. Instead, this retailer deliberately shipped the no-longer-legal ""GB"" labelled sticker. Presumably the seller had a lot of old useless illegal ""GB"" labelled sticker stock to be disposed of! The seller is counting on the majority of buyers not bothering to return the stickers they did not order because of their relatively low value. When a review describing the above was left on Amazon, Amazon refused to post it, stating that their policies did not allow criticism of sellers even if they are scammers as in this case.  Clearly Amazon is not prepared to let honesty and protection of their buyers from rogue sellers get in the way of their obscene levels of profits. Shame on you Amazon!",SI

And of course as there is no live chat with Amazon, you're left with no option other than to call their helpline at international calling rates. Needless to say, after they go through their whole script and before you even get to say anything, the call has already cost a fortune. I needed to access my account to download my ebooks to my new device only to be told that I have to open a new account. I explained that surely this will mean that I will lose years of ebook purchases. However, I was assured that they would help me transfer my ebook purchases to my new account...then I got disconnected. I then called again, went through the whole rigmorole of their script again only to be told that since they've now deleted my old account, all my ebooks are now lost and that in fact, I didn't need to open a new account at all but just go through an ID process to prove the original account was mine before they could change my mobile number to the existing account. So there you have it. Amazon and their Indian based call centre managed to royally screw me over with this cost of international calls, giving me incorrect information by telling me to open a new account, then their removal of my original account. And most frustrating, the loss of several hundreds of dollars in ebook purchases over the years that they too, deleted. It is clear to me (given the only way to contact Amazon is through an international call centre) that they absolutely do not care about customers which isn't a complete surprise when you read about all their staff and safety issues in the news.

Amazon has made their customer service and return polices so frustrating that some of us just give up in the process. This morning I spent 20 minutes trying to get through to a customer service person to get refunded for an item I have now received twice broken to bits because of improper packaging.  When I got through three days ago after the first arrived I was told that in cases where the item is so damaged and not worth returning they are authorized to make a refund on that item without returning the item.  My item was a small ceramic cat food bowl, only $6-7 cost. Not worth getting in the car to drive 5 miles to drop off some place in a baggie full of sharp broken pieces.  The rep at that time assured me that if I wanted a second one it would be better packaged. So I agreed. Well again it arrived just shattered.  So this morning I got up and attempted to retrace my steps to have someone call me.  20 minutes later and how many different help screens I went to I could not find a link.

For next 17 days, the tracking page kept saying ""item is on the way back"". Amazon automatic service was no use. The AI messenger kept telling me to wait at least 2 weeks before any live agent would attend to this matter. I requested a call back on 9/18/2022. A rep, who sounded like sitting in 2 mile deep well somewhere at the other end of the world, answered. It took 10 minutes to explain the whole situation to her. She finally understood and after multiple holds and 25 minutes call, she assured me that she's refunding the whole $216.99 to my Amazon gift card. She also assured I'd get my refund within 1-2 hours. I did get an email from Amazon but the total amount was for $150.00 and for an item that I bought in July 2022 for $9.58!!! On top of that, she changed the status of the original item that I had returned. So now it showed in my order history as if it was never returned! Good thing that I had taken a screen shot of the refund status otherwise Amazon would have denied that I ever returned the item. I went back and requested a call back. Again got a call from someone from another continent. He sounded really helpful and willing to sort it out. Unfortunately he probably was never trained to put the phone on hold properly. So after telling me to work together to sort this out, he hung up on me. Here goes the cycle again. This time got another person who again profusely apologized but still took 10 minutes to understand the issue.

I have had several occasions where they have failed to make a delivery despite my detailed instructions, or because they delivered it next door and lost my package. Instead of replacing the item, because it would cost them more to have to actually fix THEIR mistake, they would simply refund me, but then I can no longer get the product I bought at the price I paid. This is wrong. This is their mistake and they are responsible for correcting their mistake, not refunding me the money instead of replacing the item so that they can save themselves money and not take responsibility for THEIR mistake. They have also failed to return surplus shipping charges when they failed to meet their own standards. They have failed to deliver my packages because they don't follow the instructions. Essentially Amazon as a company screws its workers and it's employees as often as it can for the benefit of a few. Anyone with half a brain can see that when employees are treated well and paid well they will work well. Amazon fails to treat anyone it interacts with any decency. They are merely con artists. I recommend fighting them at every opportunity to get your items replaced and to make them pay for their mistakes.

As a small business person since 1995, and one in hospitality, I deal with human beings of every personality type, many nationalties, backgrounds, etc. What it makes you in the end, is a very fair person who because one is also the target of unfair reviews, you develop a sense of propriety and how to manage issues or turn lemon into lemonade. To this day, Amazon has never attempted to discuss lemons into lemonade. They just like to keep you sucking their sour ways of not dealing with something or admitting they're in the wrong, and ignoring you with just citing vague company policies. So the matter at hand is that I've always left constructive reviews, and rarely have said anything critical or disparaging about a product and as a filmmaker who has actually made a documentary film, I give just as much fairness to filmmakers when reviewing shows or movies I've watched on Amazon. Which is why it made absolutely no sense whatsoever when they cut off my ability to leave any reviews of any kind. And perhaps the ultimate hypocrisy of their system is that with every delivery, they want me to leave reviews about their drivers? Or if I've had other issues with products, and there's been some sort of customer service interaction, they want me to review that? Makes no sense. Now bear in mind I've contacted them over and over on this issue, but each and every time, they've never satisified the original problem with any explanation or any other possible path to recovering or restoring our client to client relationship. Instead, they just want you to bow to them and keep on paying them to be disrespectful of yourself and insult your intelligence through and through. Welcome to corporate America.",US

I did find what claimed to be a ""Made in the USA"" section.  Then I typed in dinnerware, and it returned the same dishware that I already knew to be made in China.  Sweese was a brand that came up in Made in America.  And it is clearly Made in China.  And it's so time-consuming.  You have to drill down to the ratings, then search questions to find the info.

For the past two weeks my foot has been broken, so it’s difficult for me to move around with crutches. I have purchased several items exceeding $1000.00 on Amazon since August to now.  Yesterday, I got a picture message that the item has been delivered. I went at the door and there was no item.   Last night about 10:28pm, a friend called me to dropped off food, when they arrived, I asked him to check for a package downstairs.  He sent me a picture stating that there wasn’t any package.  I reach out to Amazon, I was transferred to logistics. Whilst talking to the guy the call got disconnected.  I called back and was transferred to someone else who sent me a form to filled.  I filled the form, and based on her suggestion, I call back to have the rep replace the order.  The rep cancel the order stating she couldn’t replace the item, so I had to re-order the item. I was here listening to the News when I received a very rude email threatening me that they will close my Amazon account due to a number of replacement and refund.   I find this email very disturbing, seeing that it’s an online platform and majority of the items on their website is misleading advertisement, poor quality products, false reviews and missing parts.  In addition, the first time I did not receive a package was over a year ago when the driver never came to my place of residence. The second time which was yesterday, the package was left outside the building where anyone could have taken the the item. It’s very disheartening to see a company responded to customer in this manner.  No customer service whatever from the account specialist.  I wonder If that person who sent me the email knows that if customers choose not to purchase anything from Amazon she will be out of a job.

It's hard to understand how or why. Do people even test their features? They seem to not really care about the user experience. Since there are TOO many issues that I have found, I won't go into a list. I will just point one out that affects those that work in the Amazon world: the poorly overworked Amazon delivery person, here in India. I use an Android just an FYI. If I write a bad review, lets say one star, on the delivery of a purchase, then want to change it, maybe because I made an error. I cant change it. I should be able to click on an edit icon, usually a pictograph of a pen, and change my review. I cant. So my one star review is permanently on some delivery person's record. It is a true disservice to the very people that make Amazon work. If I go online, there is steps on how to change my review, but if I follow the steps on my Android, the steps lie. They are full of BS. They simply don't allow you to edit these reviews. Even if they WERE the steps, it shouldn't even be that difficult. You should be able to go to your review and click on a pen icon and simple change the delivery review. I can change the product review in a very easy fashion. Why not the delivery review? Seeing how Amazon fails in this one area alone is enough to warrant a one star review, but I find myriad user interface issues such as this. Its pathetic. Amazon has no excuses for bad design like this. I point out this particular problem because it harms the very people that make Amazon work, the delivery force. Amazon fails these people, in this way, and need to address this egregious defect.",IN

1378,www.amazon.com,2022-09-22T14:10:11.000Z,1,Second-hand / Returned Items and Other Issues,"Short and sweet: 1) Items are regularly second-hand or customer returns. This includes sensitive computer components like hard disk drives and motherboards that have limited life-expectancy. Many of the HDDs purchased appear to be refurbished and have warranty registrations going back two or more years; they also have manufacture dates going back up to 5 years, and these are apparently 'new.' One motherboard was returned because it was unsealed and the replacement motherboard, which was also unsealed, was nothing but problematic, with power issues requiring out-of-warranty-related payments for repairs. 2) The Alexa: what a ghastly, disturbing piece of surveillance capitalism trash that is. Get that thing out of people's homes, you spying bleeps... 3) The blatant mistreatment of warehouse staff highlighted by employee whistleblowers, documentaries etc. There are quite a few out there if curious. 4) Using heat recognition and facial recognition cameras in their warehouses that have been used to exploit Uyghur Muslims in China 5) Regular damaged goods (usually cosmetically, but it matters). 6) Unsealed goods. 7) The sheer idiocy of dropping fragile computer components through letterboxes, like HDDs in thin card. 8) Amazon following and snooping on people around the web, through that Alexa piece of trash and through people's smartphones. The irritation and annoyance of having an Amazon app as a default app on smartphones. 9) The Ring doorbell: Truly as idiotic an idea as anyone would ever have. Getting spied on by your neighbour and Amazon at the same time... ""Smile for the camera"" with a microphone. Yeah, right... All of this is quite damning and why I won't shop at Amazon ever again. Incidentally, I haven't in years. I don't give 1 star reviews usually, because I think they represent very emotional, ""angry with mummy and daddy"" psychological issues, that ultimately bring an unfairness to average review scores, but I think Amazon truly deserve it. The last time I bought anything from them was more than 2 years ago, but this stupid date of experience system will not allow the date to go back that far. However, the other issues, like the Alexa and Ring doorbells are more pervasive, contemporary problems, so perhaps it suits more recent times.",PL

Before I begin, I just want it to be known that although I am now hoping to get a job at Amazon, I had no personal affiliation with Amazon or it's employees (including Shy Lauri) during the time period for which I am writing this review: I am homeless.  I have lived on the streets of Las Vegas for nearly 3 years now.  And the only way I can order items online and have them delivered to me is through Amazon Hub Yellow Box.  I have only purchased a very few products from Amazon over the past 3 years.  Being unemployed, and homeless, I have been habitually short on money since the Covid-19 lockdowns began. This past month, I had the opportunity to purchase a few more items from Amazon.  And I had those items sent to the ""Berkeley Square"" Yellow Box, at the Amazon Hub Locker on E. Owens, in N Las Vegas, NV.  There I met the best customer service associate that I have ever had the pleasure of meeting - Ms. Shy Lauri. There were several items in my order that I had to return.  And two of those items presented problems with the Amazon refunds.  I had to go back to the Amazon Hub Locker several times, in order to troubleshoot the refund status of these items.  And each time Shy Lauri was prompt, cordial, and professional.  She took no notice of my homelessness and somewhat shabby appearance.  And she treated me with kindness and respect at every visit. She even offered me cold bottled water, each and every time.  And in Las Vegas' 110+ degree weather, that cold water was nothing short of life saving. Eventually, she help me figure out what needed to be done to receive my refunds.  And, at the same time, she helped me maintain my faith in ordering from Amazon. I am 55 years old, and I have never met such an agreeable, professional, genuinely concerned and caring employee and person.  Amazon should be proud of have Shy Lauri as an employee.  She has represented the company impeccable well.  And, in the future, I will continue to use that Amazon Hub Locker location for all my delivery needs.  Whether I am homeless, or living in a house. Shy Lauri has not only restored my faith in Amazon, she has also restored my faith in the youth of this new generation. Thank you, Shy.",US

I strongly do not recommend contacting this service, because there are no smart employees who can help you and solve some problems.

It is also clear that Amazon as a mega giant does not care one bit.  I have just spent two days and spoken to 5 people,  used the chat 3 times and am still, actually more, aggravated than than when i began.  The phone connection is inconsistent and full of static.  The people  accents are very hard to understand. I am first generation American and no stranger to accents but these reps are very garbled in their translation.  First I have twice been told an item that was never delivered would be replaced and that has never happened.  Frankly at this point I feel that they outright lie.  They lie and have no problem with it. And amazon as a company has no problem with the fact that the CS people lie and do not actually follow up on issues.  Second the delivery person here in USA is repeatedly delivering to the wrong address and no one seems to be doing anything about it. One rep actually told me they cannot follow up on something like that.  The items are going to the wrong address so often it seems to be purposeful.  Unfortunately there is no way for me to contact amazon delivery.  i tell india CS it is happening and they say they cannot contact anyone here.",US

Please take time to read our complaint and the arrogance of the response from Amazon! They’ve clearly gotten too big for their boots. Appalling Service!  Good morning. Ref: order no. 026-3091564-4971526 In March I purchased a Vax Platinum Carpet Cleaner from Amazon to be delivered to our now old address 306 Pickering Road.  We have since moved to out new address 7 Beech Lawn.  I called over two weeks ago to explain that the appliance had stopped working and was given a full refund and told that the appliance would be collected by a driver.  I explained that I no longer had the packaging and was told this was not a problem.  A UPS driver attended and refused to take the item saying it needed to be boxed, so I rang customer services again and was told it had to be boxed! I then entered an interaction with the manager who was initially very unhelpful and simply kept reiterating things over and over again sending me into such frustration the likes I have never experienced before! I then went on to buy another exact appliance from Amazon and was prepared to use that packaging to return the faulty appliance.  I rang today and spoke with yet another customer service agent who repeated over and over again that I needed to print off a label for the return, I pointed out that I do not have access to a printer and that my husband is disabled.  I asked to speak to a manager and after being refused 10 times he eventually made me wait 10 minutes before I was put through to the most obnoxious individual I have ever had the misfortune to deal with.  This man asked why I was speaking to him in this tone after I spelled out the letters UPS. I said I wasnt speaking to him in any tone and he then began to mock me with his tone which I find incomprehensible in this day and age of so called customer service.  He then abruptly put the phone down on me! I rang again to speak with a Manager this time a female and was blatantly treated with nonescelance. After being told there was no other option available and that I would have to pay for the return, otherwise I would be recharged for the appliance, which sounded to me very much like a threat.  If you see from my account activity I am a loyal PRIME customer, than youll understand why I feel so undervalued and disrespected by the staff at Amazon.  All I want is for the faulty appliance to be collected!  If I hear one more time from Amazon that I have to print out a label then consider my account closed as I will not deal with such a discriminatory organisation. I await your decision and please listen to the calls that I have had to endure. THE RESPONSE: Hello from Amazon,  You've written to an address that is not currently accepting incoming e-mails.

I went to write a review for a couple of items that I ordered from amazon that I was happy with however ended up leaving no reviews at all. amazon seems to think that they can force you to leave a picture or write a description on your reviews.

You cannot tell people what they have to say and not say or leave a picture or not on their reviews you are simply screwing your sellers out of positive reviews and adding more and more negative ones to you. I also noticed that you can only leave a review for something that you bought on amazon and not for amazon itself.

Numerous calls to Amazon Customer Service were excruciating. I was directed to One Plus (arguably even worse) who directed me back to Amazon; back and forth with their disconcerting responses couched in generic public relations language. It is nauseating. A return was arranged and someone from UPS picked up the phone the next day. UPS tracking was great and showed the phone delivered to Amazon the next day. This information did not show on my Amazon account and the umpteen calls and chats mentioned above Amazon admitted they had the phone but ""needed to be scanned."" Their promise of a refund within the legal 14 days did not happen and no matter how I appealed they ignored me. I escalated the matter and further exchanges with customer services left me realising that this corporation can do what they like to you. With many of their companies registered in places like Luxemburg the ordinary consumer will struggle to get real legal redress as they fall outside of UK law. Some aspects of their soulless and robotic responses are sinister and manipulative; it is the framework of abuse, rolling you over while using saccharine phrases about how valued you are and have a nice day etc. They ignored me completely when I told them I was entitled to a refund under the Consumer Rights Act. I also explained I was slightly out-of-pocket, having bought a leather case for the phone.I took legal advice and was refunded through my credit card; a few days after this Amazon paid up. Something has changed at Amazon. Having to deal with their soulless robotic customer services is like being abused and their claim to be ""the most customer centric company on the planet"" is pure Orwell double-speak.

A couple of weeks later theres was an order that did not get cleared by the bank (our mistake) but was paid as soon as I received the e-mail that the order payment did not go through. (Well before the deadline that Amazon has given us to pay) Despite that the account has been locked until payment was booked (10 business days, it's still locked) Because they decided to deactivate the account, the order that was already paid for and accepted was cancelled and never shipped! Even though it was already PAID FOR and the payment was taken out! They eventually reimbursed us the amount of payment, but I much rather have the item, since it was already paid and cleared!  Talking to customer service is like pulling teeth. They don't answer your questions and instead copy and paste information that has nothing to do with your situation.

It took 3 agents before I even found one who knew there was a Prime Video membership. First   2 keep giving me info on how to rent or purchase movies. As long as I have been using Prime I think I am well versed in how to do that. Only thing I learned new and of use is that you can pause your Prime membership. Of course no details on for how long but will cross that bridge when I need it. For now Amazon you need to do better. How can your customer service people not know you also offer a Prime Video membership??  This is last price increase I am going to tolerate for the immediate future as this has now been $40 in two years, Especially if you continue to selectively grant discounts. How about eliminating the selective discounts and reduce your rate for all? Barring that my first choice of who should get a discount is definitely our veterans. They deserve every and any discount available IMHO. I am wore out trying to deal with this so have to bow my head in defeat. Next year will not be the same. Count on it. Note to other seniors out there also angry over the picking and choosing of discounts know that you can still get free shipping with an order of at least $25. They will blah, blah you about the 2 day shipping you get with Prime but the timeframe has gone downhill drastically. Yesterday was first 2 day shipping I have got in many, many months. You do not get 2 days shipping on everything which is a common misunderstanding by many. It is a selective list that Amazon determines. Others may have better luck but the things I order are rarely on that selective list. Most shipments are averaging 4-5 days, some even longer.

It is important to note the only item removed from the box was the collar. Which was promptly placed back in the box. Fast-forward....we get an email two days later from AMAZON that we didn't send the fence back, they threw away whatever we supposedly did send them and they aren't going to refund us the $311. They said if we did want a refund, to return the fence.  AMAZON said if we wanted to appeal to reply to the email and they would respond within 72 hours. I responded and included all delivery receipts and the UPS Store receipt, etc. Invited them to come search my house for this supposed missing fence. SIX DAYS LATER, I send a nudge email. They finally reply saying that they did in fact get the fence but it was now ""used"" and ""in poor condition"" and they weren't going to refund the $311. OH and they had to throw it away to protect the safety of their employees.  They disregarded all further communication.  What do we as consumers do? We'd spend more than $300 getting a lawyer. How are we supposed to get proof the item was ""used"" when they THREW IT AWAY? Why does AMAZON not have any burden to provide proof as to the supposed poor condition of the returned item?

So they are running customer service effectively lawlessly, hanging up on you, cutting chat off, being rude - you just can't complain.

We contacted Amazon and they state the base is out of warranty (12 months) so they aren’t going to help. Unfortunately we wasn’t aware the base was faulty until silent night realised the base must be the cause. The base is meant to be flat and not buckled like mine. So it wasn’t possible to report the faulty base within 12 months.  Amazon are very unprofessional in this formal complaint. Their response was short and upsetting. I have since returned to Amazon explaining I am not happy with their unprofessional response and poor attitude towards a serious mis sale of goods.  I will be taking this matter up with CEDR and alternative dispute resolution team if Amazon continues to be unhelpful.

I tried to call and ask them what was happening with it, but they have it locked down and won't let you call. THEY don't think I need to call. The last and final straw was when they posted a message on my account saying I can no longer review any items I purchase. Apparently there is some kind of suspicious activity!?! They said my two reviews triggered it. First review on a butter dish ..I stated everything was great except the lid fell off too easily. ( In other words, the snap on lid doesn't work....But I didn't say it like that. I was actually nicer). The second review they told me was unacceptable raved about how great the trimmer cut my poodles hair. It I referenced my old model that was corded, which I do like, but the cord just got in the way. That's why I bought this one...the cordless. I Also talked about how it was more quiet, which was a plus for poodles. Suspicious? That's ridiculous.

Ordered something for next day delivery which was due today, I’d received the expected time and had the ‘8 stops away notification’, I could see that the driver was only a few streets away. I’d been waiting all afternoon for it to turn up and was sitting in the living room with full view of the street and whoever comes to my front door. I then noticed I had the ‘delivered successfully, handed to resident’ notification. This was obviously a flat out lie or mistake as a delivery driver hadn’t even been on my street, let alone delivered it to me by hand. Tried to speak to Amazon straight away but they have the cheek to advise ‘ask all of your neighbours, look around the outside of your house and wait 24 hours before you contact us’. This may be right in some cases but not when a driver has blatantly lied.  I spoke to an associate, the first one wasn’t very helpful at all and said that the delivery could still be delivered up to next tuesday even though it was literally out for delivery and apparently handed to me. I find it ridiculous that they claim to have no way of contacting the driver that had the parcel to ask them what’s gone wrong. I have no idea what’s happened to my parcel, has it been delivered to a completely different person on another street? Still in the van and driver just lied about delivering it? Gotten mysteriously lost? To be fair, the second associate was helpful in that she gave me a full refund straight away but I was gutted as I really wanted the item and had bought it on special offer which has now ended.

Amazon, decided to censor my review and refused to post it.  They say people only want to know about the product, and not the entire process...bull sh**.  I want to know the entire experience and I am sure you would too.  Amazon says... ""What's not allowed: Seller, order, or shipping feedback We don't allow reviews or questions and answers that focus on: Sellers and the customer service they provide Ordering issues and returns Shipping packaging Product condition and damage Shipping cost and speed Why not? Community content is meant to help customers learn about the product itself, not someone's individual experience ordering it.""  I have found that everything boils down to money or power.  In this case, I believe, it was money. They never shipped this battery in a protective shipping box.  They shipped it only in its display box.  Mind you, this battery has a lot of metal (lead) in it and its very heavy.  Everything from Amazon that I have ever received, always comes in its own padded protective shipping medium.  None of this damage would have happened if this battery was shipped correctly.   This battery was left flopping around inside its box with virtually no protection.   I have the pictures and have them available.  The battery then sat on my counter top for a few weeks.  I then noticed it had leaked a pool of acid off to its right.  Unbeknownst to me, I now can see that this battery had internal damage, root cause unknown.  I then promptly cleaned up the acid using water and a small amount of baking soda to neutralize the acid.  At this point I was hoping that everything would be ok.  I came back a few days later to find the counter top had sustained permanent damage.  We will now have to replace a counter top costing hundreds of dollars.  Looking back, I believe this was the following scenario...Company has a bad battery.   Company wants to maximize profits so company sends out defective battery in its display packaging as company knows it is not adequate to protect battery, thus battery and display box will be damaged enough to blame the shipper and company can then file a claim and make its money.  Meanwhile, customer gets taken advantage of as he/she is told they do not have to send it back but now might have to pay hazardous waste fees to dispose of it and may even sustain other expenses (in my case, a new counter top).  The Shipper is out money...the Customer is out money...and the Company wins $$$!  Again, this would have never happened if the battery was shipped in a protective padded shipping box.  Amazon has already seen this review prior to them refusing to list it.  As of now, they have not reached out to right their wrong.",US

1669,www.amazon.com,2022-08-22T01:23:27.000Z,1,Terrible Company! Should Be Boycotted.,"I've had an account with Amazon for 13 years and was a Prime member for I believe 11 years. They've gone downhill and I will no longer support this crappy company if I can. 1. Support for both buyer and seller is terrible. Incompetent foreign call center with people who hang up on you, don't speak English (I'm serious) and don't care about your problem even if it's causing you financial burden. 2. I was a seller on Amazon and I was ripped off so many times because of this company's horrible glitchy seller platform and terrible seller support. ""Seller platform"" messes everything up. Horrible interface for listing products with no explanations for complicated requirements and fields.  3. As a seller, so little money to make because it's expensive to sell on Amazon. If they charge you incorrectly, tough luck. If they damage your products in their warehouse, tough luck. If you ask for your inventory back, pay their extremely expensive shipping, and they damage your items, tough luck. 4. Never get deliveries on the days claimed. When they do ship, they use the product's original box. Sent me a computer GPU worth $500 in the product's packaging with a shipping label over it (no Amazon brown box) and left it out on a busy street. Horrible selection on Prime Video. Amazon music is just as terrible. Alexa is a terrible product. 5. I had a secondary account I wanted to delete info off of and close but couldn't access it because it was a university email that no longer exists. Rep literally told me that she can't change it for me (lol) and to just make a new account.' 6. 90% of sellers are from China. Almost 7 out of 10 items I order (that are from Chinese sellers, first page results) come defective, broken, missing parts, misdescribed, or stop working 2 weeks later. Product page info are so unprofessional  7. Amazon doesn't pay taxes and Chinese sellers don't pay income tax. But USA sellers have to do all this. They get rich and we have to struggle. 8. Required getting product brand approval by contacting an affiliated law firm by Amazon. Law firm ended up being scumbags and kept charging me for random services. Refused to leave me alone. 9. Sellers harassed me when I wrote honest negative reviews about their crap product. They use fake names then later on, contact you to bribe you with free item to write nice review for a different junk product they launch. This is against Amazon's TOS. Sellers misuse your personal info. Not trustworthy at all. 10. Amazon then deleted 11+ years worth of my reviews/ratings and banned me from ever writing one because they suspected I did something wrong. When I tried to get this resolved multiple times, they sent me a condescending email saying they will never change their minds. 11. Treats workers like crap, highly stressful work environment (even in corporate office and tech department). 12. Ex-CEO was a greedy man and we're paying for him to play in space. 13. Sellers pay for reviews and Amazon pays for reviews too. They allow Vine Reviews with no transparency. Obviously a Vine Reviewer who gets a $800 TV from Amazon wouldn't say anything bad, duh. 14. Once your product reaches less than 4 stars, it will never sale. Might as well scrap the product. So many fake reviews to keep products above 4.5 Stars. Hijacked listings from Chinese sellers (same listing is a stuffed toy one day then next month it turns into a wine glass set). 15. When you change your mind about a product (for any reason or if it's broken/defective), Amazon telsl you to stop returning so many products or they'll ban you. Then sometimes, they refund as an Amazon balance as opposed to your original payment. Resolving that requires contacting customer service which is a whole headache. 16. I returned one purchase that was the incorrect item and even said the reason was ""incorrect item"". They received my return, apparently threw away the item and then said that I didn't return the right item. Couldn't do anything about it so I took the $20 loss. I could go on and on but even my own friends and family hate Amazon for many of the same experiences. Don't support this crappy company. Don't buy the cheap products. Lastly, don't listen to those fake ""gurus"" online about ""making money with Amazon"" and don't bother with these TikTok ""influencers"" and their ""Amazon favorites"".

As a result, all reviews submitted by this account have been removed and this account will no longer be able to contribute reviews and other content on Amazon.  If you would like to learn more, please see our community guidelines.” It’s interesting that with ever purchase we are asked to submit a review.  I am new to TrustPilot and wondered if Amazon used them for their reviews. I’m guessing they do not. After years of buying products from Amazon and writing to occasional review, the above quoted statement is what I get if I try to write a review. It’s been a while since I called their customer service about this because, honestly, I’ve given up. On the phone they are most helpful and say that they “can fix that!” Well, nope. Apparently, their computer has determined we are in cahoots with the vendors. A look at the purchase history would show us to be in cahoots with all of them it that’s the case! Sometimes potential customers need to know that the part actually fits “a 1997 Dodge” even though Amazon’s computer said it doesn’t. Sometimes negative reviews have no basis. I attribute a lot of them to, what I call, 3-percenters. They would be negative if you gave them the item.  Why do I still give them a 5-star rating? If I do buy a product that I need to return, the process is simple. The return window is plenty long so I can determine if the item works for me. Also, they have a vast selection at any price you want to pay. I’ve never read a positive review that I didn’t agree with after buying and using that product. Would I buy an item having a preponderance of negative or critical reviews? Probably not, but I have and been perfectly happy with my decision. Moving on, Amazon has invested heavily in their business. Because of their distribution network it is rare that it takes more than 3 days to receive an item. Often it’s less than 2! Yes, I like to buy locally, but when they don’t have the item in stock and it will be “a week to 10 days” for delivery…with a higher price, to boot…I’m sorry, I’m going with Amazon. In my opinion, there is no online seller that can compete with them except for maybe WalMart, though their vendors often add exorbitant shipping fees.

1693,www.amazon.com,2022-07-28T05:02:03.000Z,1,Amazon has gone to sh**,"Amazon customer service has gone to complete s***. The representatives I’ve dealt with are a new definition of unhelpful and incompetent. They hire these people and don’t give them power to do ANYTHING, or so they claim. These days, you get transferred 5 times just to speak to an even more incompetent and terribly rude manager/“leadership” rep. I don’t know where Amazon is finding these people that they’re hiring but we all know it’s likely due to the pandemic and being desperate to fill positions. They clearly don’t oversee or train these employees well, because they never know how to handle a problem, yet they act so sympathetic at first, “Oh I’m so sorry to hear that”, only to tell you they can’t do anything for you after putting you on hold for 10+ minutes (speaking from personal experience), what a f****** joke of a company Amazon and it’s employees have become. I’ve called recently in the last couple months regarding damaged items received that were non returnable. I sent picture proof of the damage as requested, and didn’t get a response for over ONE week. So I called and waited on hold for FORTY minutes, just to be told, “your images were received but they’re still being reviewed”. WHAT?! ONE WEEK to review images? How stupid are these people? And why on earth can’t these representatives have the capability to process a refund or replacement if they’re able to see the pictures I sent? That makes no sense. I absolutely hate how Amazon has created this script for their reps to use with customers. The reps tell you they can’t help you, when some of them probably wish they could, but leadership isn’t allowing it.

So I'd expect a decent level of support, instead what I get is rude customer service rep not addressing my issue, telling me they cant help and then hanging up on me. This being in regards to me ordering an item, amazon sending out the wrong model of item. As a result I start a return case, specifically let them know they've sent out the wrong item. They come collect the item and I wait over a week look at their return status page to see they haven't received it. I get fed up of waiting and contact the support team who tells me they've got the item but its the wrong model. I explain that this was why I made the return and that I mentioned this in the return notes. She says she cant help send an email address to get in contact with and asks if there's anything else she can help me with. Before I can even answer she ends the chat. So I start a new chat session, and believe me I have never come across support as awful and rude as I received in that chat session. A person by the name of Anish, tells me that that the issue has already been addressed, I let him know that the last customer service rep ended the chat and as a result I didn't get a chance to get a copy of the email address. Instead of resending the email address, Anish decides to tell me that an email has been sent to my Amazon in regards to this which I can reply to. Fair enough, I go to check my inbox, no email. I check spam, no email. I let Anish know that I have received no email and to resend. He tells me that the email has already been sent and to check again. I tell him no email has been sent. He continually keeps telling me to check again, he says ""check for it properly and reply to that"" ""repeating the same would not help you"" ""we did send"" at one point I say there is no email to which he replies ""there is mate, do check"" I am actually lost for words at how awful and unprofessional the level of support provided by Amazon was a company that is supposed to be known for good support. I rarely write reviews even about the negative experiences but this is on another level of unprofessional.

Because I’m in between sizes, I purchased 2 sizes in three different styles. I’ve already returned a few items, but there is no sign of my return, no sign of the items even tho there are tracking numbers, and no sign of any refunds. This has been going on since the end of June. Is this the game Amazon plays now??? People buy, but if items need to be returned you’re out of luck? Trying to get customer service is like going through tangled red tape in a government bureaucracy of a banana republic, or the DMV in New Orleans. The inefficiency of Amazon hurts only customers. After I get out of this Amazon circus, I’m not going back in. Buy local. And if anyone wants to start a class action lawsuit against Amazon’s return policies, I want in.",US

And he just ignored me and told me that no charges were made and kept repeating that I have to talk to the bank.  Like okay, I get it, I can always open a dispute, but isn’t your job to look into the issue and ensure that no further charges are made to my account?  How can you not see that charges have been made to my card? If your system charged my card then it has to be in the system?

It's kinda long but I wanted to share how ridiculous they are and customer service is terrible.  So I created an account a long time ago, like 6 months before making a first order. I decided to save a bit and applied for Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Card. Obviosly applying for Prime features prior. So I was approved instantly for that credit card. I got their offer as well, they added $100 on my account as a bonus for applying for Amazon Credit card. So I happily made my first purchase with that CC (credit card) I just got and to kind check if that's gonna work because I just applied for that CC like 5 minutes ago. It was good, and I pucrhased e-gift card to check it's gonna work. It was delivered almost instantly. So then I needed something for which I decided to use Amazon Card and for later shopping and get those 5% back they offering. I needed an item which costs more than $2000. I placed an order in the late evening, and on the next morning I saw that my account is on hold. They wanted to see a billing statement from a NEW AMAZON CARD which I just got. That morning I could not (and still can't) use Amazon properly, because anytime I log in I see this form to submit a billing statement for that new CC. That morning I submitted a screenshot from a bank that I own this card but my bank account shows that I have 0 billing statements as it is a new card. In the ""comment section"" I put that I do not have billing statement rn as it is a new CC. They did not accept it, I tried submit it second time explaining the same, it did not work.  I began to call them after 2 days because they took like 2hrs to respond that they can't accept my screenshot first time, and second time they needed 24 hours to say the same. So after 2 days I began to call. First time I needed to explain my whole situation again to representative. That's funny, they ask about the email on an account, I gave it to them, and both times I called they said ""Oh, it's locked"", 2 times I was like, ""yeah, that's why I am calling..."". Like why would I call otherwise if I can't do anything with my account when it's on hold and when this form to submit a billing statemnt pops up every time and I can't close it. So first guy was supportive and said okay I submit something for you and you should receive an email from address-verification team. And I did. They asked me to see my recent utility bill. I sent it to them because at that time I was pissed and it's been like few days trying to get a NORMAL help from Amazon and not semi-automatic replies that ""We do not accept the screenshots that you sent us that your card is new"". So I sent utility bill to them and it was ok because they did not complain. But it did not help and we returned where we began. It's been almost 3 weeks, I still see that form to submit and I still can't. I missed those ""Primedays"" on Amazon where they give massive discounts, and my Prime is useleess right now, I can't use my account and no one can help me. I called support 3 times, they say ""Only thing we can do is to help fill out the form"" blah blah blah or seomthing similar like wait till you get your billing statement. Superviser said you can write an email to A.-V. team. Nothing much help honestly. I wrote that email to that address verification team explaining my situation that it is so ridicilous I can't with Amazon. I asked if there are any other ways to prove that I am the owner, seems like utility bill is the only option they had, and I just returned to where I was and address-verification team was not helpful. Last time I ""spoke"" to Amazon was yesterday and A.-V. team replied on email ""we were unable to verify ownership of your payment ending in **** because we need a legit billing document. Your account is still temporarily on hold."". I just gave up honestly. I lost Prime days, and gonna loose 1.5 months just because Amazon is blatanlty ridiculous and they cannot believe that a person can have a new card, which by the way Amazon's CC, and which by the way I was approve on Amazon's website. So multiple submitions on the website, multiple conversation on email, multiple calls to them... no help.

He obviously knew with the OTP requirement it was a expensive item, so he delivered 1 parcel asked for the OTP, then kept the box that the OTP was for! Crafty, thief!! If I’ve learned anything from this experience it’s document everything, track item like a hawk and have a camera at your door, it will make getting a refund easier.

First, they ship me electronics, which arrive soaking wet. (literally water dripping out of the equipment)  Then they let me know that they will send me replacements, but I must please ship the damaged equipment back to them. They do not pay for the return shipment upfront, that needs to come out of your pocket, you need to contact them to get a refund which they call a ""good faith"" refund.  Not only that but this package had to be shipped from a different damn continent to their refund facilities in USA. 12 days after sending the package back to them they start charging me on my credit card because they have not received the damaged goods.  Yes, you read that right. 12 days to ship almost across the globe, is a realistic time for Amazon.  This being said, Amazon took almost 2 months to ship the item to me, but they expect me to ship it back to them within 12 days?  I have fought with their support/customer care again and again to no avail. They just tell you that you will get your money back when they receive the package.  It has now been a month and a half due to US customs keeping the package for longer than expected, and of course, Amazon has randomly deducted large amounts of money from my bank account, without any notifications!  I need to pay interest on these amounts because it is coming off of my credit card!  I have had to take desperate measures and remove the account from my Amazon profile as well as keep it empty, otherwise, they continually deduct money.  This was my first time ever buying from Amazon, and I promise it will be my last.  I would advise any other person to avoid buying from this company.

I will have to take it up with Amazon customer care or file a civil lawsuit against the company  --> I called the customer care again explaining the same and they gave the same reply that they cannot do anything unless I have a police report even though their own delivery person did not deliver  --> at this point I'm bawling as I know I lost $644.78 to an organization that is making billions because of customers like me.

I mean I get that a lot of these people are likely over worked under paid ect. So I guess it’s a you get what you pay for type situation but as it sits, I’d rather wait on hold for 4 hours than deal with 95% of their support staff. These people are hopelessly under trained and they will end calls/chats well before they are done likely due to the fact that they need to help so many people per hour or something. I’ll describe what my experience was with them today. I had ordered A blink camera 2 pack with free blink mini (notice FREE BLINK MINI) a Sync Module and a Display port cable. Upon checking the order I noticed they had ordered me 2 Sync modules instead of one. So I contact support, first agent skips me second agent skips me third agent joins the chat and proceeds to tell me the items are already in the shipping phase so I’ll have to wait until I receive the items and return it. It’s has been less than 5 minutes since I placed the order (in otherwords she’s lying because she doesn’t want to deal with the situation). Representative number 4 joins the chat because number 3 disconnects as soon as she tells me she can’t do anything. Rep number 4 fixes it right away. Now I look at the order and notice the display port cable hadn’t been added to the order strange but no big deal it’s probably why their system added two sync modules instead of one. But now I notice something else, They are charging me for the free item. So I contact support about this the agent I speak with somehow does not understand the problem of being charged for a free item. Either way she sets up a call for me to explain it to someone else. This representative then proceeds to blame me for this issue claiming their system does not make mistakes and if that is how I was charged that is how I added the items to the cart meaning in her mind I added the camera 2 pack and the mini camera to my cart separately then checked out. Even though when I go to the link for the 2 pack with free blink mini it states that I last ordered that item on that day. She was straight up gaslighting me. Trying to convince me what I personally did and what I was seeing were wrong. When I requested to speak to her manager she refused.

The time before this, they wanted me to fill out a ""form"", which was just an email with some questions in it. I did so and you should have seen the OVER 20 EMAILS I got back telling me that I didn't fill out the ""form"" correctly, therefore they could not do anything to fix the situation! Such infractions as NOT PUTTING THE ANSWER BEFORE THE QUESTION were cited.

A friend of mine tried to take advantage of the same deal, and they told him that it was a scam, and the offer was never available, meanwhile I got my credit.  They are so backward and full of lies and dishonesty, that it is so unbelievable.  The sales rep he spoke to basically screamed and yelled at him, put on a supervisor, and she yelled at him as well. Amazon, you lost a million dollar customer.  Shame on you!!!",US

The customer service were not interested and told be just to wait and I will get my item soon. I found this quite insulting. I also pay for prime and asked for a months refund and the person laughed at me and said that’s not what we do.",GB

Even if you've requested the money to b refunded to the same method used, they'll put your money on a ""gift card"".  They are trying to hold onto a pool of funds.  Your chump change X's a million customer refunds on gift cards amounts to quite a sizeable amount. Even though you push the correct button requesting that your refund is returned using the same payment method, they'll still go around you and put it on a gift card. Amazon wants you to CALL them and request in person that the money be placed back on your original payment method. This has happened to me 4x's.  It's not an accident or my mistake.  I made sure of this, which is why it has happened 4 X's in a row, during a two week period.   Check your return label and follow through ***If they want phone calls...let's give them phone calls.  This is part of their ""new credit system"" ... fight back Americans.",US

No major problems to report until now --> Out-of-the-blue Amazon banned me from doing reviews. Because of some mysterious policy and terms of use that somehow I broke. All my reviews were deleted leaving me to wonder what happened and why.  I sent an email to the address on the notice that I could no longer do reviews. Never received a response. Asked, and received absolutely no explanation for this ban.  Since Amazon reviews and approves ALL reviews, it's a mystery how could I have posted something so bad that I was banned from doing so ever again. Why were the posts approved to begin with, if they were so bad? Amazon as a business has the right to do whatever it wants, but this unexpected situation gave me pause. As a customer, I also have the right to shop wherever I want, and I am doing a lot more Macy, Target, and Walmart shopping now.",US
