You seem determined to make it as difficult as possible for customers seeking redress,"In June 2021 I bought a high spec 24‚Äù iMac at a cost of ¬£2,500 from the UK Apple Store.  I was very happy until, out of the blue, it failed completely on 14th December 2022 in the middle of a Teams call.  I was not able to restart it. I contacted Apple who ran through some basic diagnostics and advised me to take it to an authorised repairer. I was told that my iMac was out-of-warranty as it was more that 1 year old, the implication being that I would need to pay for a repair. I delivered it to an iStore in Guildford on 16th December 2022. On the 20th December 2022 the iStore informed me that in addition to the ¬£90 diagnostic fee I had already paid I would need to pay ¬£475 for a new Logic Board. This seemed outrageous for a product that was 18-months old. On reviewing my rights as a consumer I wrote to Apple. The letter included the following: The Consumer Rights Act 2015 makes it an implied term of the contract I have with Apple that goods be as described, fit for purpose and of satisfactory quality. As you are in breach of contract and I've owned the product between 6 months and 6 years, I am within my statutory rights to ask for it to be repaired. The reply came back that I had sent this to the wrong place in Apple and I should contact Apple Care. 22 December 2022 - I speak to an advisor - John - who assures me he will take ownership and resolve the issue for me. He sounds very uncertain and hesitant when he learns that I am referencing consumer rights law to require Apple to pay for the repair. However, he eventually gives the iStore the go-ahead to complete the repair. He sends me a link to a site that allows me to leave a message and /or voicemail for him if I need further help. 6 January 2023 - iStore inform me that they have tried various ways to fix the iMac but nothing works. They are at a loss as to how to repair it. I contact John via the link he has sent me but get no response. 8 January 2023 - I call Apple Support and speak to Daniela who assures me she understands how frustrating this is and she will now take ownership of the case and resolve my issue. At this stage I ask for a like-for-like replacement of the iMac since it appears to be impossible to repair. She needs to talk to another department in Apple to see if this can be done but as they do not work on weekends cannot progress it further. She promises to call me the next day. 9 January 2023 - Daniela calls and says that she has confirmed with the iStore that they do not know how to repair it. She tells me that I need to collect the faulty iMac from the iStore and when I have it to let her know so that she can see if the machine can be replaced. When I question why I need to collect it to send to them rather than have the iStore send it to them and why she could not guarantee that it would be exchanged, her response was that this is how we do things and there can be no deviation from that. 10 January 2023 - I call the iStore to arrange to collect the faulty iMac the following day. 11 January 2023 - The iStore text me to say that they are not sure that they can have the iMac reassembled in time to collect that day. I contact Apple Support to express my frustration with the process. I speak to Paulo who assures me he understands my frustration and that he will now take ownership and resolve my problem. When I insist that I need progress on the replacement he proceeds to process a like-for-like replacement order even though I do not yet have the iMac in my possession. He asks me to ensure the iStore repair order completion is sent to him stating that the device is not repairable. While talking to him a text comes through telling me that the iMac is ready for collection from the iStore. I pick up the faulty iMac and the iStore immediately volunteer a refund of the ¬£90 diagnostic fee (well done iStore!) and send me the repair order completion. I forward the repair order completion immediately to Paulo via the link he sent me and as a reply to the email (belt and braces). 12 January 2023 - update to follow",GB

How is sending out a driver to collect my item in line with Apple's much lauded sustainability policy to send out an extra driver, when they could have taken my computer back today? I also could have the new computer I need. Instead I am stuck with an old one, waiting for an adviser on the phone. Very tired and upset. Manager asked me why I couldn't stick with the wrong product.

Until I purchased an iMac for my son that I thought would get him through high school. More specifically an iMac (Retina 4K, 21.5-inch, 2017). Long story short the chip with this mac had issues from the start. I spoke to over 15 Apple service specialists. They even admitted at times that their were known issues with this model and the ability to upgrade operating systems (a necessity with Apple products for safety and other reasons) crashed the system. Mojave never worked right and I was led through numerous hoops.  So my son could never use his Christmas gift because it was always not booting or at the Apple store being repaired.  In the end they wanted to charge me $500 and would not offer any trade in value, well, because it didn't work. It didn't work because of the bad chip choice they made when they built it!

As it now turns out it was bought way to early as I was under the misguided thinking that the warranty kicks in when the product is activated and not when purchased and how wrong I was.  My daughter decided to wear the watch on Christmas Day as it had not been worn in a while ( but had been charged ) and it would not activate. It registered on her phone and on the find my iPhone app. We tried factory reset but to no avail.Today was the first opportunity I had to contact an authorised Apple repair centre and explained my case and was told that I MAY be able to get it repaired under European consumer law ( two year warranty ). I was then told to contact Apple to see would they authorise the repair but was passed to a manager who was very quick to tell me that I had mentioned European consumer law to one of his customer service agents and it was a legal process and they must adhere to the law. He clearly stated that Apple should have been informed within the two years but as I previously wrote above I incorrectly thought the warranty kicks in on activation. He did offer a replacement at approximately the cost of a new watch but I politely declined. If a two year warranty is a legal matter for Apple then why are their authorised sellers offering two year warranties. I would just encourage anyone thinking of buying an apple product to make themselves very familiar with the Apple warranty ( and what is included ) , it‚Äôs starting date and also their rights under European law. I would encourage consumers to contact Apple if they have any issues with their apple products well within their warranty period and to clarify if they are entitled to the extended warranty under European law ( at no cost ).

I purchased a MacBook Air & a custom hardshell case for that computer online at Best Buy and picked it up, 11/29/21 on 12/1/21. ~ $ 1,236 2. I called on the last day of the return window, telling best buy reps at the store, at the phone number on the back of the credit card, and at the geek squad desk that I can‚Äôt use the product nor the case designed specifically for the product. 3. I described my Allergic reaction, which began upon opening the product‚Äôs factory sealed cellophane & box, becoming severe within ~ a minute or so, and was the same type of allergic reaction that I have had in the past to Mold/MRSA exposure 4. Luckily, I had both rescue inhaler and epinephrine auto inject pens in case of another exposure. I contracted a serious sinus (MRSA) infection, ill 9 days after opening the seal & required Specialist appointments at $ 35.00 each & specialized meds, lasting thru May/June ~ $ 300 5. Best Buy, after several calls & disconnects, said I couldn‚Äôt return nor exchange it, I had to try Apple. 6. Apple directed me, after several calls to Simply Mac to have it evaluated on site & then return & exchange could be processed‚Ä¶ 7. Simply Mac evaluated it & tried several times over several weeks to get in touch with Apple, with no luck. They told me to call Apple back. 8. Again, I tried to resolve the issue with Apple. After several days of calls, where I was interrogated by the Risk management department, they said it was not their problem and the Mold/MRSA came from Best Buy. 9. Eventually I tried the My Best Buy credit card company and have been re-sending the same data over and over again. Apparently there are no people at the address given on the statement: PO BOX 70601, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19176-0601, nor at the address provided in the form letter denial with no specifics to my case listed in the letter beyond item & price & date, no person‚Äôs name nor department name, nor contact number nor extension for which to contact them. Second address was PO BOX 790441, St. Louis, MO 63179-0441. 10. All documentation was mailed via certified mail, so the mail center staff exists‚Ä¶ They receive payments, after all. 11. The letter also suggests trying the toll free best buy store & credit card phone numbers. The representatives said that there is no dispute department available. 12.

190,www.apple.com,2022-12-21T18:07:29.000Z,1,Absolutely dreadful Apple Support today,"After years of Apple Support, and the Support being the main reason for continuing to buy Apple products, I have totally changed my mind after two phone calls with Apple Support today, which ended up actually making me cry.  I bought my new SE about a week ago and the audio wasn't working properly, amongst other things, and the first support man shared my screen and ran a diagnostics check on it.  He didn't tell me the result but muttered something about a repair.  I said I didn't want it repaired, that it was only days old.  He then said we should update it.  Clicked on that and it said it would take 4 minutes - the support man said after 4 minutes it would switch off and then on again and everything should be alright.  That he would send me an email with a case number and if there was any problem I should get them to ring me back.  Well it got stuck at 2 seconds at the end for ages and then went onto a screen that said update to version 16.2, which it already was.  I then tried to get Apple to ring me back but when the call was scheduled it had the wrong number to contact me.  I then had to get onto Chat to tell them about that.  At some point I had a message that I would be put through to Repairs - that's when I lost it.  Eventually I got another support man on the phone who asked me what was wrong and when I started explaining about the audio he started shouting at me saying he didn't understand what I was saying.  I kept having to repeat it, but of course it wasn't just the audio anymore it was the fact that the update wasn't working and other things weren't working.  He got quite aggressive and I asked him why he was shouting at me which made him worse.  It was really awful.  Eventually the line went dead. I tried ringing the Apple store at Milton Keynes where I'd bought the phone.  It goes through to a central answering thing and I spoke to a really nice woman who told me that of course I didn't have to have it repaired I could take it in and get a replacement or my money back.   I have noticed before that when Apple can sort out your problem they send you a feedback form but if they don't get you sorted then they don't send one, so the person you have been speaking to never gets a bad review.   Before I bought this latest SE I had debated whether to tie myself into another Apple product but decided it was worth it.  But now I would never buy Apple again.",GB
191,www.apple.com,2022-12-31T18:49:21.000Z,1,My final word on Apple.,"I fail to understand how this company is even in business let alone successful. Or actually I do, they prey on the fact that people will pay exorbiant amounts of money to get nothing so long as others do it too and its ‚Äúcool‚Äù or everyone else is doing it. The iphone se I am using right now I sincerely regret buying and to think I had considered the iphone 13. Its a bunch of hot garbage. Who needs a logo with a bite taken out when something as trivial as typing is an absolute pain in the a$$. Like my fingers are in pain just writing this review and thats saying something because on my old motorolla phone (the most budget 200$ phone you could buy) my fingers never hurt and typing was fine. The app store is a garbage dump of ads and lousy apps that constantly spam you with ads and ask for money. The google play store is superior in every way. Even the reviews on the app store are biased to apples content since they claim mainstream apps only have a couple thousand reviews which is obviously nonsense. (Or the alternative that apple deletes reviews they don‚Äôt like) But on top of that you only get to see a few of the preselected reviews they want you to see. My home screen looks like someone threw up on it and is practically unusable. The customiztions are almost nonexistent and changing how it looks is such a pain you just want to throw your phone in the trash. I disabled autocorrect because not once did it help it just made an already awful typing experience worse so I am used to autocorrecting myself and constantly having to retype what I wrote (case in point has to retype ‚Äúwrote‚Äù 3 times). I can‚Äôt so much as rearrange the order of apps let alone make a gap between them so I can make things look as they should and be more productive. Why are so many people high on the cameras? I find the photos to be okay at best and the night mode on the se is nonexistent. If the lighting is bad the photo looks like it was shot on some cheap camera from a 10 dollar drone you ordered from aliexpress if that. Shall I continue? I‚Äôll take that as a yes (your fault you chose to read on) when I make a damn hotspot it not only takes about a full minute to actually turn on, it also will randomly turn off for no good reason and yes, it was actively connected. Yes I checked ever online tip and article in existence yeah I burned another 30 braincells and valuable time on this awful company. In my dads words ‚Äúthe iphone isn‚Äôt fun to use but I survive‚Äù he‚Äôs right and I respect that but I‚Äôll let my standards dictate what I‚Äôm going to survive on and if the most widespread phone brand fails to do that, then I won‚Äôt be using them anymore. Thank god I didn‚Äôt buy a macbook or airpods they are somehow worse and I haven‚Äôt gotten the pain of experiencing it firsthand yet. Lets do better people spend the hour or two with a trusted friend or website finding your needs and buy something you will actually enjoy using in the future. Maybe even for old times sake when people bothered using their brains once in a while, pull out that trusty notebook you never actually used and jot down some standards for what you want not what they want cause that I canspell out for you; YOUR-MONEY (Save a hot load of money too think free music and the ability to download stuff like apks or customize your homescreen or not pay anymore subscriptions or just upfront pay half the price for one hell of a better piece of tech that has been forced to innovate and prove itself.)",IL

IPhone 12 pro max purchased September 2021. After updating May 2022, lost cellular signal. Apple would not accept it for control, they advised resetting the phone, I lost all my data, but the phone was functioning. Same problem, no signal after update July 2022, same approach, reset, lost all my data again. 3rd time 10 days ago, Apple would not accept it without charging me because 12 months went out, pointed me to the shop I purchased it. The shop starts mumbling about 12 months warranty, I remind them we live in EU, they point me to mcare, a service point. Service point resets my phone, of course I lose all my data one more time (3rd time in half year!), but I keep my patience and I get a working phone from mcare in Stockholm, last Friday 2nd December 2022. Today, 2 days after I got it from mcare service, the phone went totally dead and I am writing from a 200 euro Huawei which is 5 and a half years old and works still like it should. I contacted Apple support, only solution is to take it back where I purchased. I mean, what is this? Why should we pay 1500 euros for something that has no support at all? I am a surgeon that relies on my phone and it's impossible to keep going like this. It's not about the money, but why wouldn't you take responsibility when you deliver faulty products? This is totally unacceptable. I had never such problems with much less expensive phones. Untill you make this right I won't ever reconsider getting any of your products, not even for 20% of the retail price, it doesn't worth the hassle arguing with you. This is supposed to be Apple support??? I will take this garbage to the shop tomorrow and I really hope that you prove me wrong, because right now for me you are common small crook thieves.

All efforts to rectify this became a pain in the bum because my kids so stressed me out to fix it.  Fom one roadside charger to another and not working afterwards. Until I thought why not go to Apple directly, whom I bought both IPADs from.  I popped into 02 Store in Woolwich and asked for Apple IPAD chargers.  The agent told me both chargers would set me aback by ¬£48.  I screamed because I had been used to buying roadside chargers for ¬£10 max, which stopped working a week after.  I took the risk and bought both chargers for ¬£48 and for the next 7 months, I had respite from my kids - no more charger challenge anymore, until recently when both chargers stopped working and all hell was let lose.  My kids are so used to their IPADs the way I am so used to my smart phone. So I know what they are going through each time they can't get their IPAD to work.  I went back to the 02 store for warranty replacement and was told to contact Apple directly.  I did and Apple fixed an appointment for me to pop into their nearest store at Stratford to get the items replaced.  I visited apple Stratford and got both chargers replaced, bran new without any questions. At Apple shop Stratford, I was not only wowed by their excellent customer service amidst a huge endless crowd, I was bowled over by Apples display of a vast array of 21st century gadgets, ranging from smart iPhones to tablets and PCs. And I remembered Steve Jobs of blessed memory and his subsisting legacy, the Apple brand. May he continue to RIP.  I advise all and sundry, should you ever wish to purchase, any smart phones, tablets and PCs, please go to Apple for quality, and after care service.  Because you have purchased from Apple, (any product, even outside waranty) Apple will continue to look after you and that product for life.  Eg 2 IPADs (8 generation- 2020) I bought for my kids at the cost of ¬£450 each...  Even when it was outside warranty when my younger daughter (8yr old) had her screen broken, Apple offered me same product, bran new replacement at the cost of ¬£200 (which I considered to be a very ridiculous PRIZE). No seller out there will do similar. Hence I said if you must buy any smart phones, tablet or PCs, for Quality and your own peace of mind, pls buy ONLY from Apple cos Apple will look after u and your product for life...  Now, that's just a thought on Apple, Steve Jobs legacy.. May he continue to RIP.",GB

This sale(delivery) was such a bad experience, I was even cursed at and threatened )veiled threat) by the delivery driver (Uber, yes Uber),my product returned and now scrambling to try and get it by Christmas. I placed an order over the phone with a GREAT rep, she explained if I wanted before Christmas for $9.00 the product will be delivered by Monday (basically two days) by ‚Äúcourier‚Äù. Wow, how can you pass that up, right? She explained someone has to be at the delivery location at a scheduled time to sign for it. Knowing I couldn‚Äôt be there I gave specific instructions on where to bring it and someone who will sign(yes after the incident I checked the order it‚Äôs there). I got a call six times in a row on delivery day, I kept ignoring it, finally I picked up and scream (and cursed) who the *** is this? The person said Uber‚Ä¶I immediately said don‚Äôt call this number again and hung up. Another call and I picked up and screamed didn‚Äôt I said don‚Äôt ******* call this number? He screamed yo I got a delivery for you from Apple..I told well you got instructions on what do go do it don‚Äôt call‚Ä¶ than he said to watch the way you talk mother****** you a tough guy on the phone you think you a gangster punk mother****** , come down let‚Äôs see what happens to you‚Ä¶ Anyway my wife stopped me from running there‚Ä¶ I got an email saying order cannot be delivered, it‚Äôs being returned to the store and refund issued‚Ä¶. I waited about a hour or two calmed down, and called Apple. I explained what happened and they said now I have to replace the order and won‚Äôt be available for delivery till after Christmas, which I can‚Äôt understand, store, less than a mile alway and they are using Uber for deliveries, the latest or should have been able to be delivered with three days, really a hour to correct this mistake. The support person me she‚Äôll connect me with a sales rep and maybe they can get it deliveeed earlier than Christmas.  Now speaking with a sales rep, who I‚Äôm assuming is in the actual store (btw no such thing to speak to one from a store) this person tells me they don‚Äôt have this item in stock at the store at this time (mind you there‚Äôs a butt load of these products there I found out later and my order was just returned) I asked if he‚Äôs in the store he said no I‚Äôm in the sales department (not in a retail location)  I waited a couple of hours decided to call the store directly, for a person, he said there is a lot of them in stock, and I figured he‚Äôs in the store cause I called the store number (guess what he‚Äôs not, it gets routed to Apples sales centers which is not a retail location) Now I‚Äôm forced to try to find time to go to this store and pick up the new order all because a ‚Äúcourier‚Äù (Uber driver) didnt want to get out of his car to bring the delivery into a store for a signature as the delivery instructions stated. It was a horrible and disgusting experience.  The fact that Apple didn‚Äôt offer a comparable solution to the matter (placing the order and having redelivered immediately by ‚Äúcourier‚Äù),  or allowing people to speak with a person ina a physical retail location, and allowing these Uber drivers make deliveries for them is crazy.  They don‚Äôt understand this is Nyc Uber drivers aren‚Äôt getting out of their cars to make deliveries cause they one, to lazy, two can, in that short time get a stack of parking tickets.",US
199,www.apple.com,2022-12-19T01:37:15.000Z,1,Hard to trust employee information,"To Whom It May Concern: I am writing today to complain of the poor service and advice I received from Sherway Mall‚Äôs Apple store employee on November 30, 2022 that led me to purchase a fake iPhone and lose 1500$ in the process. I walked in to purchase a new iPhone 14 pro Nov 30th 2022 where the following took place: Your Apple employee advised me that there were no iPhone 14 pro‚Äôs available in stock and that I would have to reserve one by adding my name to a reservation list. The iPhone 14 pro would only arrive on December 28th. Unfortunately, this date would not work as I was scheduled to leave the country December 16, 2022. To my surprise, the employee proceeded to advise me that since I would be out of country Dec 28th, he could NOT add me to the reservation list. I proceeded to search the mall at all electronic stores who are licensed to sell Apple products/iPhone in attempt to locate said iPhone. With no luck, and no choice quite frankly, I started looking for iPhones in the online market. I located one on Facebook marketplace from an individual selling a brand-new iPhone boxed with receipt of purchase. This seemed legitimate, however, to be cautious and prior to completing this transaction, I phoned the Apple store at Yorkdale mall. This is where I spoke to an employee who verified the purchase based on the information on the receipt. The seller‚Äôs reason for selling was that ‚Äúhis father wasn‚Äôt an iPhone guy‚Äù. Your Apple employee assured and verified that this iPhone in question was in fact real according to the serial number and information on its receipt. However, once the transaction and exchange took place, I got home and quickly attempted to sync my iPhone with this new one only to learn that I had been scammed and this was a fake iPhone. Not only am I annoyed that I wasted a morning getting inaccurate information, being turned away by an Apple employee, but in turn due to my time constraints, I looked at other options one being to purchase an iPhone online (from a con artist). My impression of Apple has been tarnished, and I am now considering getting rid of all Apple products. I have been a loyal customer for over 15 years! My whole family has iPhones, iPhone watches, iPads, Apple desktop and laptops (including my businesses). Furthermore, your customer service representative gave inaccurate information when in fact I came to find out that Apple receives iPhones every two days if you walk in during shipment days you have an opportunity to get one (alternative to being put on the reservation list). Had I known this information, I would have made a more informed decision and gladly returned to purchase my new iPhone with confidence at an Apple store. Your service representative‚Äôs inability to provide accurate information has caused me duress, incurred expense relating to $1500 lost to a fake iPhone & now also a lost loyal customer. I would like to note that I have contacted police to file a report and they are unable to assist in these online fraud instances. I trust this is not the way Apple wishes to conduct business with valued customers‚ÄîI have been with you for many years and have never encountered such treatment before. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss matters further and to learn how you propose to prevent a similar situation from recurring. I look forward to hearing from you.",CA

Once I did get it at the store, they started pressuring me to buy the Apple Care +. I said I'll decide when I get to use the phone for a few days or so. Fast forward a few days, I get the Apple Care +. A week later I decide to return the phone as I cannot get it to work for the apps that I generally use.  I called Apple Customer Support for help with my apps but they were useless.  It seems merit is not a prerequisite in their hiring protocols but the need to meet a certain inclusiveness. I go  back to the store to return the Iphone upon which they issue me a full refund. However when it comes to the Apple Care + refund, they told me I will have to call Apple in order to get my refund. I called Apple,  and after 2 hours of being passed about like a baseball they say they issued the refund. It took another week for the refund to clear my bank. Apple is a disaster, greedy and in the end they will fail. Follow up ....The refund that Apple issued for the actual iphone was by way of Paybright, the Company they use to finance your purchase should you decide to pay monthly for 2 years. Paybright issued the refund the next day but it took a solid week to have the refund posted back into my Credit Card. I had to call Paybright several times to ensure that a refund was coming. All the while my available credit on the Credit card was showing a debit of $2000 which I couldn't use for other purchases.  All in all my experience with Apple was a nightmare, one that I will never ever repeat. Both Apple and Paybright deserve each other. My advice...If you need a cell phone buy one that is used and rock bottom cheap and change it every year or so. There are millions of them out there. Avoid Apple.",CA

This was important as I was moving in two weeks.  After 4 days, I was told the laptop would be in repair ""indefinitely"" while a part was ordered.  I called Apple asking for the address the repaired laptop was sent to to be changed and was told ""the system is down, call back in a few days"".  After another few days of waiting with no updates, I called and after getting the runaround for 2 hours (!!), I finally learned that the return address could not be changed.  What a huge waste of time.  Since I would not be flying back just to pick up my laptop, I just canceled the repair.  If I had known Applecare was such a huge pain to make use of, I never would have purchased it in the first place.  What has happened to Apple?

I have been using iPhone Notes quite a while to store all my important notes such as passwords and important messages. It has been accumulated hundreds of notes over the year. It was pretty handy until a couple of days ago it suddenly disappeared! All of them! I did not do anything such as deleting or grouping etc. I was crazy about this lost as I can‚Äôt do my normal work without those Notes records. I looked up from internet to try to get some tips to retrieve them back. I‚Äôve tried all the methods suggested without success. I realised that my notes were not stored in either of my iCloud or my outlook account because both of these accounts were full and could not take sync from my iPhone. So I think all my notes were stored locally in my iPhone. I went to a few mobile phone shops and was told there is no way to recover those lost data. I called Apple technical support and was given 3 other data recovery companies. I tried again without any success. By looking up from Internet for more information, I can see quite a few people had these problems before. But very strange that they did not talk too much after raising this issue. I summarise all my findings here: 1. iPhone iOS has a bug in its Notes which can automatic remove locally stored data even you have upgrade to iOS16. Or maybe hardware storage is not stable (that may be dangerous to other data storage!) 2. iPhone Notes locally stored data lost cannot be recovered by any methods. 3. Apple cannot help at all and they don‚Äôt acknowledge this bug and they don‚Äôt want to take any responsibility to the data lost 4. Please use iCould or your email accounts to store your Notes rather than local stored. Also make sure those accounts have space to sync your iPhone notes.",AU

308,www.apple.com,2022-10-14T21:06:06.000Z,1,Apples phone are not guaranteed against water damage.,"I've used Apple most of my adult life and just about every device I have ever bought has had some manufacturing issue.  But as a designer I like Apple and I like the operating system so you end up staying with them. My most recent disaster was with my iPhone pro 11, I have just had the battery changed by Apple in Covent Garden and took it on holiday with me. While swimming I dropped it in the water but wasn't really bothered because it's waterproof and I have dropped it in water before. A day later the screen got a green line up it and was non operational to touch.  I took it to the Apple Store in Covent Garden and explain the situation. They explained that it had indeed got water damage, but wasn't covered by any warranty and never was since it was only water resistant. The Italian government have already taken Apple to court over this matter and I know there is further court action happening in New York. But it's still shocking when you hear someone sat in front of you saying that your waterproof phone is only water resistant and only at 8m for 30mins.  I said to the assistant that you find that statement contradictory. I also said it was clearly waterproof or water-resistant when you change the battery, to which she replied 'believe me Sir it would've been as good as the day it came out the factory if we replace the battery.' But they also said the glue they use to waterproof it weakens with time. That means 1 week I guess. Clearly this was not true since it had been in water before and never had a problem even though I had no idea that it was not waterproof but only water resistant and not covered ever by the warranty. To be honest when I bought it I don't remember it saying that it was only water resistant at eight meters for 30 seconds. But clearly Apple need to be more upfront about the water resistant claims since it contradicts the fact that they don't guarantee it and never did. It's a bit like me saying I'm a designer but I can't guarantee I can design.  I assume the same is true of my Apple Watch which I swim with!! In the end the silence was too much and the Apple assistance mouth was just oddly gawping at me.  It must be hard for these poor assistance to have to make excuses on behalf of their employer. So the bottom line is your phone is water resistant to x depth for X amount of time, plus it's also not advisable to take it into water because we don't guarantee it. It's really high time I left my dysfunctional relationship with Apple devices, hard as it is we can't go on. At the end of the day Apple probably have done some cost benefit analysis and decided the legal costs are worth factoring in.",GB

They have set up the website and even phone service so that you may not ever speak to a person or make an appt with the genius bar without actually going to the store first.

363,www.apple.com,2022-09-29T12:54:50.000Z,1,Apple placing vulnerable people at risk,"On Tuesday my partners iPhone locked her out from her phone. She had entered the lock screen code correctly; however, it was not recognised so she had to wait! After waiting she again entered the code, no joy! Eventually the phone completely locked her out for good.  Even tried the turn on and off method but again no joy. Tried to use a PC by accessing her iTunes account, however that rejected all password attempts, recovery attempts and creating a new password. iTunes then locked her out of that. I downloaded the Apple support App to my iPhone and connected Apple who called me back creating case number 101816350239. Basically, after lots of chit chat, we were told that we would have to wait for the Apple ‚Äúsystem‚Äù to allow access because the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù was sending verification texts to her phone but there was no way she could view them. We tried with the support worker various methods through the APP but nothing and again told would have to wait. Today (Thursday) my Partner received an email stating that she would have to wait until 28th October 2022 until the issue with the Apple Id and password recovery could be fixed. This I found completely unacceptable as my partner is has caring responsibilities towards a child and her father who has Dementia, so I contacted Apple again through the APP who then called back creating case number 101817389546 So, by now you can see that we are using my iPhone to communicate with Apple. In short, we were told that the Apple ‚ÄúSystem‚Äù cannot unlock the phone because they do not have enough information to verify her identity, however, was told that despite this, once the waiting period had elapsed (25th Oct 2022) the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù would allow her back into the phone. So, let‚Äôs look at this again, Apple stated that because they did not have enough DATA, they could not verify identity however if we could provide DATA, it would be unlocked, however we cannot provide that DATA as she cannot view texts sent to her by APPLE. However, if we cannot provide that DATA then she would gain access by 25th October 2022. It is clear that this is a way of harvesting DATA which in the UK is unlawful, we understand that Apple consider it as security steps, but we all know that Apple could unlock the account/phone etc if they really wanted to but harvesting DATA seems to be important to them. The other aspect is that my partner purchased an iPhone to access a service, yet Apple are now withholding that service through no fault of her own and in the UK that is unlawful. So, at great expense we have to go and buy a new phone (non-Apple, obviously) due to her caring responsibilities and because a multibillion-pound company does not want to sort this mess out that was created at the end of the day because Apple did not recognise her screen lock code on multiple occasions. Now I know, my partner is just 1 person amongst millions of iPhone users so the reality is that they wont bother with us minions, however it is important to share our experience with people which may include national media outlets as this is not right, they are placing those reliant of her care at risk.",GB

I wanted to reset my password (for most companies it is a straight forward job but not for all mighty Apple), to encounter a huge problem. They asked me to submit all via email and phone message (they emailed me and sent me a text to enter code, which I did), I punched their both codes to prove it is me and not a thief then they treated me as a thief. They said they will get in touch within 24h with further details. They did get in touch within 24h (on the 24h hour rather than a second earlier) only to say they will either call me or text me on 7 October to re-set my password. I was in shock. When I rang I was told they do not have enough date on me (I used to have Apple products from iPhone to Mac Pro but chose to switch to Samsung), hence I have to wait to reset my password. In this age and date one would think it is much easier to deal with anything, a question to Apple is, how much more data will you have for me on 7 October if you did not have enough now in order to re set my password. Imagine if  I was in need of  more complex issue!!! With such behaviour they put me off to purchase their new IPhone 14 pro and IPad, instead I will opt for Samsung 22 and 23 later on. They have way much better customer service and certainly do not need 3 weeks to re set password. Especially if they check your identity via your phone and email at the same time. Insane.

It happened overnight.  It is under warranty. It spent a week with apple agents.  Agents have said it is not software, not battery and  unusual. Apple agree it is not right but all Apple do is insist they perform more tests. We are now 2 weeks on and they have run the same diagnostics over and over. Asked the same questions every call. Telling me there are more diagnostices to run.  It passes all their tests, but discharges 10% each hour whislt sitting on a desk. I have to pay the ¬£42 costs for the initial inspection where they tell me something is wrong and it is unusual. Now I have to wait another week for them to take a look at the next set of tests. So three weeks of looking at my phone to see if they can replace it, never once suggesting it is working as it should. I am told there is yet another set of diagnosis at the end of the three weeks. Almost 10% of the phones life spent in apples remediation process..... no obvious outcome yet.  So far over 4 hours on the phone, several hours more in the repair shop, a new phone costs Apple less than this if you charged out the time. So be warned, when you buy an i phone it should state clearly the battery life is expected to be under 8 hours within a year. Their telephone after sales service is non existant (lots of lovely people who cannot do anything). Their warranty is rendered inoperable for the burocracy. It all adds up to a major issue with the description of the goods under the sale of goods act in the UK. Escalated from tier one to tier two who tell me they have the authority to order a replacement. However they dont because the Engineers have the authority. Weird. We went to a Genius Bar ... they told us there ws nothing wrong, but we were very determined.  The replacement phone lasts 5 to 6 times as long as the old one. Still Apple refuse to believe there was anything wrong with the old phone. In fact they were rude to very end suggesting I would be back within a week complaining about the new phone!!  Their diagnostics are like the emissions tests on the VW cars, designed to show it is OK.  Looks like the apple is rotten to the core.",US

I also have older airpods.  I subscribe to Apple Fitness, Apple Music and Apple Cloud.  I work for a marketing agency and asked them upon hire to send me a macbook because I haven't used Windows in years and it would slow me down. Ya think that would carry a little weight???  Ya think that given how much I have invested in the Apple brand that when 3 weeks after I receive my AppleWatch, they announce a newer model and I want to exchange my brand new watch for it, they would grant me some wiggle room?  I mean they have a 2 week return for any reason policy but i missed it by 4 days... FOUR DAYS.  I called Apple got bounced around for an hour and was told by 2 people to trade it in meaning my brand new $500 watch would be worth $300 because of those 4 days. Wow. Steve Jobs may have been an a-hole but at least his Apple took care of the loyalists and wasn't as petty as Tim Cook's Apple.

There is no point in being contactable more than the competition when your customer support is inferior. Firstly I contacted Apple to find which was the most up-to-date Apple phone I could buy secondhand which would have the most updates and they advise me to buy an Apple 11 pro Max iPhone. The person I talked to was incompetent and told me to buy a phone which was the last Apple phone ever made which would not receive 5G. I don‚Äôt understand why people like Apple employ untrained ignorant people on the front line who are going to cost th5m the business by giving out disinformation. Also. Every time there is an Apple update I have to do Apple‚Äòs job for them, find the new relevant bug, and sort it out myself because Apple are incapable of doing so, cause more issues with the new updates than they tend to alleviate. Why is it that customers are not told when there are updates and their phone stopped working with products from the App Store when, if only the customers could be told that their phones need updating, there would be no problem? You reach out to customer support at Apple, they give you bad information and you end up with an inferior product because they employ people who they do not train and who are ignorant costing us business customers in conscionable amounts of money. I‚Äôve now invested in an iPhone 11 Pro Max on the advice of Apple only to find that my provider is putting lots of new masts in my town with 5G and that my phone cannot receive it after asking Apple‚Äôs advice on what phone to buy.

I‚Äôm disappointed of the next iOS update, iOS 16. The biggest feature of this update is only changes in the lock screen, that‚Äòs it. Any other features are small and are not required for me. If I compare iOS 16 with Android 13, I honestly need to say that Android 13 is better than iOS 16. Android 13 has new design options like the Material You. It also has improvements in privacy and in the permission manager. iOS 16 is just about the lock screen, it doesn‚Äôt have any design changes or useful features at all. The switch to iPhone  didn‚Äòt meet my expectations. I hope that Google will release their Pixel 7 series as soon as possible, because I am seriously thinking to switch to Android (stock Android this time) again.",DE

They quoted me a price that was the same price as the a new set of AirPods I questioned them on this. That said that it was a place holder for the repair and would be adjusted to a lesser amount once the repair was completed once they isolated what the problem was. I have now been charged the full price of a new set of AirPods but they only replaced the charging case. I called and complained to the support staff for the adjustment and no adjustment is going to be made. Overall very  dissatisfied with the misinformation from the first technician/support staff and the handling that was done by the support staff when I called back complaining about the lack of adjustment to the initial debit/holding.,US

It seemed like it had a hard drive failure and the apple operator made an appointment for me to take it into their Apple authorized reseller store Simply Mac at the Avenues in Marrietta, GA.  It was supposed to take 3 to 4 days to diagnose the problem then let me know what the repair would entail.  I tried to call the store on June 10th to get an update, but I got a recording that they were busy and to leave a message.  The same thing happened on June 11th so I drove to the store that day.  It turns out that the Simply Mac store had gone out of business and June 9th and no one called me to notify me to pick up my computer.  The rental office of the mall could not open the shop for me to retrieve my computer because the Simply Mac had filed for bankruptcy and it was in litigation.  The rental office gave me the number of the bankruptcy attorney in Salt Lake City.  I called him and he tried to help but said he was being ghosted by Apple and the landlord.  I have made repeated calls to Apple support since June 11th and they could only say that I should wait for an email from Apple.  I kept calling Apple, the mall rental office  and the attorney every two weeks because I nevery received an update regarding my iMac.   I finally I received a call from Apple support today August 24th, 2022 telling me that the representative/partner who emptied the store cannot locate my computer.  So basically, my computer has been stolen from a store that was recommended to me by Apple Support.  The apple agent who emptied the store, will not return my calls or answer my emails. I was advised to contact Simply Mac attorney and file a claim. Attorney sent forms but mentioned that I may never be compensated or if I did it may be years.  How ridiculous is that?  I believe this warrants a call to All local news stations. I filed a police report for stolen computer.",US

He tried to patronize me asking what I did for a living, etc.  Then another employee joined in and again remarked ""Oh! An antique!"", and proceeded to try to sell me the iPhone SE. The other employee reminded me that none of Apple's employees work on commission but were only there to help me.   Then I met another employee who also reminded me that I had an old phone, and that the iPhone SE was much faster. He tried to patronize me complimenting me on my watch.  Finally, just to get the Hell out of there I agreed to buy the phone They'd really hammered me to buy the phone.

Apple support solution is to replace it for ¬£3 less than buying a new one from the apple store... you cannot make this stuff up. If you find this service acceptable then Apple products are for you . Update in regards to the ipad : Took it to covent Garden Apple store and it was fixed on the spot, it was a software issue apparently, yeap the difference between ¬£550 and ¬£0 is to go to a better apple store, I would avoid the brent cross one.

So I spent 2 hours today being passed around by apple reps.  Noone wants to help.  They cant identify my order - even from their Apple customer/order/referece numbers on my apple invoice. I  cant email, they wont send transcripts of our recorded conversation, wont send sny record of our conversations and of course cant find or deliver my ipad.  They have of course kept my money.   Its dreadful.  Why wrap the apple pencil in a ‚Äúcustomer experience‚Äù but not deliver the ipad.  What to do?  They dont have email.  They control phone access.  Theyvteain staff as a Firewall.   I can only write to Apple with a hand written letter, or Small Claims petition, or fill in an Apple prewritten set of pointless complaint ‚Äúoptions‚Äù - none relevant.  So its a small claims case against apple for effectively scamming me?  What else can I do?  Not as the adverts at all?  Buy Samsung? Apple invented the ‚Äúcustomer experience‚Äù concept.

I was told by the lady I spoke to that she would put in an Urgent request to her box to get me my MacBook. That never happened either she never pass it on or Apple couldn't be bothered.

I rang Apple to be told they can't do anything to help me as it was with the courier and they do what they want.

I go for Samsung, allready have tv and next phones are from them too, synchronising and everything more easy, and good quality. Apple dont even deserve 1 star, if I could choose 0 stars, that was better option. How it started: I planned my holiday and want to upgrade, from 11 to iphone 13, better pictures etc... nice for the holiday. On apple. com /nl the dutch apple website stayed today ordered, tomorrow at home. I thought I go for real quality, not a reseller like Coolblue, just direct at Apple, for the trust and that I can swap in my previous Iphone 11.  Next day I got an email and I could follow the package, it was strange because my package with the Iphone 13 went from Eindhoven Netherlands to Brussel Belgium. And more strange that the package was on hold the next day. So I called Apple and they search it out and said, we dont know whats happen and we will do a research, this will take maximum 10 days. But I had no time to wait bcs of my holiday I should go. So I came with the solution, I go now by car 1 hour go and 1 hour return to Amsterdam Apple store and grab it there. No that was not possible, I can go to the Apple store but should paid that one too, and the other one I needed to wait till the research it was done and after that I shoul get money back. I went to the apple store and bought the 13, now I was just on time to go on holiday. In the meanwhile I got per post the paper cover to put my old Iphone in and send it to swap in.  The employee from apple. com/ nl told me I should cancel my order and than I got automatically my money back, so I did do. When I was on holiday I received an email that the swap in should be canceled, if the Iphone 11 was already at the location it should be send back.  I called again to say that they can keep and i want the money for the swap in 290 euro.  No it goes by an external company, likewize. They couldnt call or email them because they have no phone number and not even an email program, are they lying or is this a strange community? Never met administration people without an emailadress..... So I should take contact and arrange everything by myself. After I came home from holiday the iphone 11 were sended back indeed. The good thing was I got the money back from the Iphone 13 i ordered. But now I had an Iphone 11 and I dont want to sell it at internet, that was the reason I did choose the swapp in/ trade in from apple. Now the woman told me that the apple store said things what was not true and appologize many times, I told her to search a solution and not think following the script, but I only hear her talking like a robot, and ask for a big discount than, the next time I buy I can get a small present, like a cable or Iphone cover.... they really dont listen, I asked to discus with her manager.... not possible.  Online because I was 2 weeks later back from holiday my phone was now worth 270, 25 euro less, and they even dont want to pay for it. While the whole mistake is from apple.  25 euro is offcourse for them nothing. For me its a principe to, what a way how you treat your customers... The whole conversation was really bad, I feel like in a factory, like a number, not a client. They should do this: Sorry sir, ok here is a voucher for 25 euro, show me or prove that your iphone is less worth now and you get it. You can spend it on apple products.  Than I said I want to complain about this customer service. She told me its only possible by sending a letter to apple in Ireland.... When you pay or when they need money or sell it all goes over internet, ones you complain send a letter to Ireland.... this is the way how they work... to build a wall and hope nobody will do. Why not: complaints at apple.com?  They need to change their whole attitude!  I got more angry and angry while the talk goes further.  I didnt want to send a review. because I never do and dont want to waste my time. But at the moment Im still busy to sell my iphone 11 by the company Likewize what they send. Im afraid I need to go to the apple store again..... so much time wasting and loosed only because the **** customerservice from apple and all their internall rules, reallly not helpfull!!

520,www.apple.com,2022-07-31T15:23:31.000Z,1,This is a testimony to how I was‚Ä¶,"This is a testimony to how I was treated by Apple Support Portugal. Around 2018 I purchased a Macbook Pro 15 via Amazon and before the one year mark was up, I decided to purchase Apple Care + (3 extra years of support) just in case. When I received my invoice, though, I noticed the support date ended two years from the purchase date - not the 3 years I had been told via phone. This was when my ordeal began. I went to the support site and tried calling them, and after waiting for several minutes and the call not being picked up, it got disconnected. Strangely enough, when my intention was to make a purchase, customer support not only answered my calls immediately, but they even called me back within 5 minutes. I scheduled a support call (mind you, this was right after the purchase) and on my chosen date, I got no call. Fast forward a few months and numerous attempts to contact support again, and I still had no luck. One year later, after many failed calls and being blatantly ignored (scheduled calls, attempted calls from my part) I decided to contact US support. I got an immediate reply via chat, however, wrong country, so no one could answer why my Apple Care + was 2 years instead of 3. Great. On 2021, the 2 year extra support ends and lo and behold, my touchbar decides to stop working. After a few more attempts to contact or being contacted by Apple Portugal, I contact US support and a few troubleshooting steps later, the technician concludes with 100% certainty that my touchbar has to be replaced... Not only that, but since the replacement is out of warranty, it would cost me $1475 because the whole upper part of my latop had to be replaced - much like the keyboard replacement program. Again: my ""not 3 year"" Apple Care+ had just ended, like, 20 days prior to this. Murphy's Law at its best... I ask if I can send it to be repaired under the keyboard replacement program, but no ""the device has to have proven keyboard issues to be repaired under that program"", which made me seriously consider shoving dirt under the keys just to cause an issue with the keyboard and have it repaired for free. At this point, I'm basically being punished for not having keyboard issues. However, once again, US service cannot help me any further because again: wrong country. I decide to live with a broken touchbar. It still worked, I just couldn't see half of it and had to pretty much guess what I was pressing. I wasn't going to invest 1500 bucks on a 2500 computer that I was still paying (loan). This was last month: I decided to reset the Macbook and upgrade it to Monterey and the touchbar issue resolved itself. Thank you Apple for the $1500 quote on a software issue. And thank you Apple Portugal for simply ignoring my existence (I have process numbers and proof of everything that happened). Anyway I hope my experience helps anyone who had/has issues with Apple, and particularly tech issues the touchbar on the A1990 2018 Macbook Pro and was told it would need to be repaired. Also it should serve as an eye-opener to Apple so they address the huge customer service problem here in Portugal. PS - I tried making a formal complaint in Apple forums and here's their reply, after removing my post. Apparently censorship and silencing customers who have issues is considered good business practice: ""We removed your post Awful customer support in Portugal - Issue with touchbar because it contained rants or complaints that weren‚Äôt constructive. We understand wanting to share experiences, but these forums are meant for technical questions that can be answered by the community."" I personally believe a non working touchbar that started working after an update qualifies as a tech problem... But it also means less money for Apple, right? So let's pretend that it's an hardware issue and charge people 1500 bucks for a replacement that doesn't solve anything. And by the way, let's not let anyone be made aware that it's a software issue... Never again...",PT

It was in stock and it was supposed to be delivered on the following day, Friday, July 22. UPS picked it up from Apple in Chicago on Friday at 9:22 AM. We live in downtown Chicago. You'd think it would be an easy delivery, no? Well, you'd be wrong.  We didn't get it on Friday. Apple did collect the $923.56 from my wife on Saturday. But we didn't get the phone on Saturday or Sunday either.  On Monday July 25 I checked our order status at the Apple Store online. It said: ""Shipment on hold. There is an issue with your delivery and the carrier is unable to deliver your package. Please contact us at 1-800-MY-APPLE."" Come again??? We live in downtown Chicago, about 1.4 miles from the Michigan Avenue Apple Store. We get deliveries from UPS all the time. There's a doorman in our lobby twenty-four hours seven days a week. But UPS is unable to deliver our package? That's very interesting. What happened? We'd love to know more. We checked the UPS website. They had updated their tracking information. It said they'd deliver the package by 7:00 PM that evening. We waited till past 7:00 PM. They didn't. We called Apple. There was a nice lady who looked into it for us. She took a lot of notes. She said they had no idea what was going on. They would start an investigation. But we should call UPS, too. We called UPS. It took about twenty minutes before we managed to get past the automatic dragon lady who won't let you talk to a human being unless you have a magic key. We spoke to a nice lady who looked into it for us. She said they couldn't tell us anything. We weren't the shipper. They can only talk to the shipper. We should ask Apple to start an investigation. We told her we already had. She said we should be patient.  On Tuesday July 26 we called Apple again. We spoke to a nice man. He looked into it for us. He read all of the notes and took some more notes. He said he saw the problem. But he had no updates. We should be  patient. They have a process. It needs to run its course. We would hear from them no later than two days after they started the investigation. We didn't.  Today it's Thursday July 28, a week since we placed the order, six days since it was shipped, five days since our money was collected. We still haven't heard from Apple. But UPS did update their tracking information a while ago. It says that ""the delivery date will be provided as soon as possible."" Apparently it wasn't possible on Tuesday. It wasn't possible on Wednesday either. Apparently it's still not possible today.  Can you believe it? We paid more than $900 for an Apple iPhone that was supposed to arrive six days ago. It must be somewhere in Chicago don't you think? But where? When will we get it? Apple isn't able to locate it? Can't track it with some global-corporate equivalent of the ""FindMy"" app technology that works so well to track my son and my wife? UPS can't locate it either? Somebody doesn't know how to scan a bar code? The dog ate the paper? The driver got sick? ""It fell off the truck""?  I guess it serves us right for trusting Apple and UPS that $923.56 would be enough to make them do their job. We should have walked to the Apple Store and picked it up in person. It's only half an hour walk away. But we got Covid ten days ago. We're still recovering. We ought to be patient. So we're whiling away our time on the web and on the phone. We ought to get paid for this! It's hard work. Like I said: FUBAR! P.S. In case anybody cares: I bought my first Mac in 1985. Or was it 1984?

Notified some days later of my item bring ready for collection, I returned to the store and completed the exchange. What the store failed to tell me was that inside the sealed box was only a replacement charger. Had they have told me, I would‚Äôve kept my USB-C cable and instruction manual. But since they didn‚Äôt tell me and this wasn‚Äôt realised until I got home, I again had to reach out to Apple. Initially using the text chat facility, I was told I would need to make an appointment to be contacted by phone. Really?! That call achieved little. The member of staff didn‚Äôt grasp the problem and simply transferred my call - cold - to my local store. Needless to say, it meant ANOTHER visit to the Apple store.

Apple Repair sent it back without even looking at it because they said the Activation Lock was still enabled - but didn‚Äôt tell me how to disable it or what to do with it after I did! I called support and the tech walked me through the exact same steps I‚Äôd already done at the Apple Store then was at a loss and had to escalate it to a senior tech. 35 minutes later I finally got the Activation Lock removed.

Instead of Apple being the Apple I used to know, recognize the issue being a design flaw and deal with it as they used to (giving the best service by fixing it without hesitation and with that having the best consumer relation ever), today Apple did not live up to the quality I think I pay for when choosing premium products with price tags alike. When I brought it in for service since it is a design flaw the costs were all politely played back to me anyway. Approximately 500 euro without a blink.  My first deeply disappointing experience with what once was an ultra premium quality brand with even better service. Now I felt left in the cold without any service with inferior products with premium price tags. It makes me really sad. What happened to ‚Äúmy‚Äù Apple‚Ä¶??? Fred Woerden Amsterdam",NL

Was told it would be fixed for free under warranty after inspection.  Got a text saying it's been sent off and a link to check progress.  5 days of checking daily, and the link still showed just ""repair requested"".  Called Apple Support and was told that the repair had been cancelled.  She said she had no more info than that.  After pressing the matter, she eventually said that the iPad was being returned back to the Apple Store.  She couldn't tell me why the repair had been declined as the relevant department was closed.  (Surely there would just be notes on-screen under the repair reference?) She told me to call the store and gave me a direct number.  The direct number did everything it could to NOT transfer me to the store and back to the main support line.  After the fifth attempt (i told it i had lost an item and left in the store) it put me through to the store.  The phone rang and rang and rang and eventually cut me off.  This happened 3 times over 2 days.  Still no idea what is going on. If Apple read this, the ref was R544123404 Probably won't, as reading other comments here they don't seem to care.",GB

Last October I bought my new iPhone 13pr, iPad Pro , Apple Pencil and AirPods online. As all my data was transferred from my old iPhone and I chose dark mode to protect my eyes, I did not notice there is a faulty pixel on my iPhone 13pro at the top left corner. It‚Äôs very difficult to notice because of the black margin of Apple screen. Lately when I change to the light mode, I see it and call Apple service to seek for the replacement as I am still in warranty. But the customer service ask me to diagnose it with a technician appointed by them. I have to drive one hour to go to the service store, but they can not diagnose it only if I leave this phone to them two days. I would not like to leave my phone cuz I will have no phone to use and I will have to drive back to get it, and the technician guy said they might only change the screen after open and check the phone. My iPhone is working well and brand new condition but with a small faulty black pixel on, I do not need more damage to the phone merely because it has a faulty pixel. So I called Apple service again to tell them the issue and ask for direct replacement because I did nothing wrong for this faulty product from them. They admit this faulty pixel might caused by the faulty hardware, or it might be caused by the software. Neither of the reasons was my fault, but according to their terms if I purchased an Apple product, I need to suffer all these troubles their faulty product caused. They will not replace it if I do not drive to the service store several time and let them open my iphone so them can find out what caused the faulty pixel even if I did not misuse. Apple causes so many troubles for customers to give up seeking for their right to get a good product in warranty time. I do not wanna to risk to get a broken phone after I got a faulty product. I will keep this faulty black pixel on my phone screen as a reminder of the terrible customer service from Apple and stop purchasing Apple products.

The quality of engineering in this device is simply brilliant. The user experience is seamless and intuitive which is exactly what I like, all your services are integrated in the Apple ecosystem, but you can access other services if you want.  It‚Äôs got the power, the versatility to be a lot of things and it feels very premium, even with the MagSafe case it looks and feels amazing.

They were fine but no better than cheaper alternatives and on one front a lot worse. The batteries in both died after very moderate usage. Nine years on I purchased an Ipad. Tried to log on to the Apple system but as I did not remember my password or old phone number it was impossible. I gave up after much frustration. I will say my Ipad is excellent more six years on the battery holds its charge for months. Recently I purchased two reconditioned ipods to listen to Audible books. Audible decided to close their Windows app that worked with the iPod. The replacement turns out to only work with the latest iPod. This was a fact I discovered after four hours of trying to sort out my password only to have to get a new account with a new email address. Then I had to fill in a lengthy form on the iPod's tiny screen and the keypad designed for the finger size of a three year old. Six months ago I considered an iPhone purchase but then remembered how difficult Apple make it to carry out the simplest process (eg. File transfer). Bought a top of the range Samsung instead.,GB

It looks terrible to see Stick out the half of your iPhone out of your short. I am using an phone case on my belt and looks more professional and secure, than to show an big size stupid 6.1 or 6.7 inch and wait that someone steel it out of your pocket.

Right before the phone stopped working I got an error message that the face ID was no longer working. After doing some research myself I found out that if the face id camera gets water damaged it can cause a shortage to the logic board causing the phone not to turn on. I went an hour away to an apple store near me and I told them exactly what I stated above and his response was that they dont have any way to open it up and its most likely that the logic board is fried and the phone wont start up meanin that I would need to either spend 600 on a replacement or double that on a new phone. My main issue here was that I had not backed up my phone so there was important data on there that I needed and he told me my only other option would be to send it out to california and potentially be charged up to FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS to save my data... because the company is reputable lol. I made the right choice to take matters into my own hands and youtube how to remove the face id component. After weeks of waiting for the right tools to open the phone because they make it near impossible to do so for this exact reason, I come to find that I am correct, I unplug the face ID and my phone comes back to life. This company is pure evil and the definition of greed. Sadly so many people wont know or would be scared to try and figure it out on their own and they lose important data because of how greedy these people are.

After a few days he got a call from the store. The program is valid for 4 years after purchasing. Now he has to pay 700EUR. There is also a problem with the screen. It show vertical flikkering lines. Those lines are only visible on grey or light blue parts on the screen. For this problem he has to pay 800EUR. The repair costs are totally crazy. We called Apple Support. They said the program expired and they would not help us in any other way. Even after a call with a senior they refused to help. My dad paid a lot of money for a good quality product.

The insanity enters at this point.   In order to reset these security questions, they asked me to answer one of them again!! I still couldn't answer so that was that. Catch 22. Who in their right mind asks a question that has already been proven unanswerable in order to change that same question??

The support guy was very patient but he couldn't fix it and he wants to call me again next week to try once more. Neither he nor I are confident. The problem appears insurmountable which means that when my old email address is switched off, all the apps I bought with it will need to be downloaded or purchased again. The issue is that all the configurations, progress and additions made to these apps will be gone. It's fu***** madness! Every other account I have updated where this kind of issue arose was fixable because the company concerned sent an email with a link in it that I could use to reset the login/password/security question/whatever. Apple however are fanatical fundamentalists who consider that if you cannot answer a fifteen year old question then you are not who you say you are. End of story. Nothing more to be said or done.

They told me that my Airpods were beyond repair. I called to see the reason, and mind you; I didn't get upset or go off on anyone; I needed to know what I would pay $89.00 for. The rep was rude, and I asked to speak with someone else that could assist me further. she wouldn't let me talk with anyone else, so I asked for her first and last name plus her employee ID number. She hung up in my face, and that got me hot. I called back to speak with someone else, and they told me that since I got the Airpods from a third party, they would not cover my Airpods under warranty. I can come and purchase another pair from them where I would be covered. Why would I spend another 200 bucks for some Airpods I got two months ago. Apple is full of it.",US

I have always used a protective bumper silicone case with all my phones and this one was no different. Anyway, still within the warranty period (just about), the phone developed another issue where it would randomly reboot. I reported this and as it was during covid, they said to post it off and sent the box etc out to do that. I posted the phone off and when they received it, they refused to fix it, citing the reason was that it had 'been opened before and therefore the warranty was void'. i responded and indicated it was them that carried out the previous warranty repair and could back this up with receipts etc but i also knew they would have their own records of this. Anyway, several back and forwards later and they said the screws on the bottom of the phone were marked and that their support staff would never have left them like that. i said the phone hadnt been anywhere else but that maybe the bumper case had caused some wear along the bottom. They said this was unlikely and basically called me a liar and said they werent fixing it as the warranty was void. I appealed the decision but they came back with the same conculsion.

I got a call from John in couple of hours and John who was saying himself as a Senior Manager was super rude/arrogant starting from the call. He was saying it is no one's fault when product is getting delayed. I am not understanding how can it be no one's fault and he used the word, Apple can't do anything in this matter and I have only one option to wait for my product for which I have spent $1100.

However, after about 8 days, the customer service office told me to go to the nearest store to turn the watch in for repair.  It took about 8 days to get it back, because they had to examine the watch to see if it was something I did to the watch to keep it from working.

Because apple decided to do an automatic update while I was asleep and I ‚Äúshould have backed it up before updating it‚Äù like I knew it was going to update and should have expected apple to just go through and delete tons of photos.  On another note, their products are trash I got the iphone 12 new and within 2 months it was running slowly and glitching out but ‚Äúthey couldn‚Äôt see a problem with it‚Äù so warranty didn‚Äôt cover it.

I had only a month before had my previous (very old and smashed) Iphone stolen from me, which was not insured with applecare. This prompted me to take the precaution to purchase the theft and loss package when I bought my Iphone 11. The applecare claim process was very quick and straightforward via an online form format. Once I submitted the claim online, I called customer services to ensure I'd done everything right and that it had been submitted properly. They were extremely helpful and I received my new phone two days later. I would definitely recommend investing in the Applecare Theft/loss package especially if you live anywhere in or like London. Phone theft is rife but this experience put me at ease that apple will get things sorted if it happens for a third time (hoping it won't) !",GB

719,www.apple.com,2022-04-30T08:43:12.000Z,5,30 year journey loaded with Apple goodness,"About 12 years ago, I started using Apple phones with the 3gs iPhone. I buy a new iPhone almost every year, but each phone provides 3-4 years of service as my wife and children use 'hand me downs' when I change.  Yes, an annual iPhone shuffle! :)  During these 12 years, I've used over ten different iPhones, and NOT ONE has presented a problem that Apple didn't promptly resolve.  Most never had any issue.  I've sometimes wondered if the extended warranty has been necessary, but I think it is worthwhile for the duration we use them!   I've also purchased an iMac, Macbook Pro, AirPods, iPad, AirPod Pro, and other devices.  It hasn't been all smooth sailing across all these devices, but on the rare occasion I've faced issues, Apple has always taken pride in resolving them to my satisfaction. I'm pragmatic and believe problems and electronics are inevitable.  What matters to me is the frequency and how they resolve issues when they do arise.  In that regard, Apple set the standard for consumer electronics. I recently had an event where I inquired about an out-of-warranty device issue. Apple support engaged me comprehensively and ultimately replaced the item FOC (Free Of Charge) as it ""Didn't meet their standards"".  I went to their service centre expecting to spend and came away with a free replacement.  That only comes from an organisation that will stand by its products. I started as an Apple II computer user in the late '80s and, after a lengthy break, joined their Mac world in 2012.  Since then, I've enjoyed the Apple echo system, which prioritises my needs and privacy.  I consider alternatives occasionally, but I currently see no serious contender.  Ease of use, reliability, longevity and delivering a complete package is all part of the reasoning behind my conclusion. If you consider Apple's pricing versus what they deliver holistically, I believe they are not the most costly.  It can be hard to differentiate purchase price from cost over a device's life, but you will not be disappointed when you can take that step!",SG

In 2021 the screen light does not work anymore because a cable is broken inside. This is a very well-known hidden defect called ""FLEXGATE"".  Apple is now forced to repair Flexgate for free on Macbook 13, but still refuses to do the same for Macbook 15... So the small computer has a problem, but not the big one?

After weeks of trying to find a solution with Apple, I even sent a letter (with acknowledgment of receipt) to Apple in Cork (Ireland). But 3 and a half months later, still no answer from Apple. My first contact with Apple was 4 months ago... How can a company that sells luxury products be so disrespectful to its own loyal customers?

The delivery timetable was clear on the Apple Store site -- I would have to wait longer because I was ordering the computer with the larger screen. Apart from choosing the model w/a 16"" screen, everything else about my order was standard. Nevertheless, Apple has apparently chosen not to stock these machines in its stores -- instead, the company with a larger market capitalisation than ANY OTHER COMPANY ON THE PLANET has opted for the 'just-in-time' supply chain strategy favoured by most other large multinationals. That's all fine, so long as customer needs and expectations are managed proactively by Apple.  But here, they have failed completely -- I was told at the time I placed my order that I should expect to wait roughly 8 weeks for delivery. This was irritating and put pressure on me to keep my ailing, 7-year-old MacBook Pro operational, but I was informed of the timetable for delivery BEFORE I placed my order, so at least I could make an informed decision. Now, however, Apple is apparently having supply chain problems.  Two weeks ago, they confirmed I could expect delivery this week (w/c 25th April); today, I received an update announcing the new deliery window is now between 14-27th JUNE). The unfortunate customer service reps I spoke with after receiving this unwelcome news had nothing useful to tell me, other than the usual scripted acknowledgements of my frustration and apologies for inconvenience. Sorry, Apple -- THIS IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH. Perhaps consider dedicating a tiny fraction of your insane market cap to establishing a more diversified supply chain, given there's no end in sight to the factors we can all presume will continue to disrupt manufacturing for the foreseeable future.

Sneakily I think, they tried to imply the fault might lie with my bank, when it was clearly their own mistaken and chaotic billing and accounting methods.  What a pathetic company they have become.  The right arm never knows what the left arm is doing.  It takes hours to sort something simple.  I said I wanted to make a complaint, spent another half an hour trying to explain this to someone who couldn't speak english properly, to then be told complaint would be noted, but that they did not respond to complaints.

The App Review Team and App Review Board have been consistently rejecting my app, the reason being: ""Guideline 4.3 - Design We continue to find that your app provides the same feature set as other apps submitted to the App Store; it simply varies in content or language, which is considered a form of spam."" This is 100% false because my app has unique features not found on other apps on the App Store. My app does comply with the App Store Review Guidelines because it offers unique, high quality features not found on other apps. Based on their definition of 4.3.0, their claim of my app violating 4.3.0 is false and not valid. The strange part is that the supposedly similar apps don't offer the features that my app offers, yet those apps are able to get their app submissions approved (April 2022). I should also mention that those apps were published after mine. I have already notified them about this. I have provided screenshots, video demos, source code, spoken to the App Review team and the App Review Board, filed numerous appeals and they are still rejecting the app because of 4.3.0. They appear to be ignoring the information I've been providing and are responding to me with generic responses. At this time, as I have exhausted all options, I've filed a complaint with the BBB and have consulted a lawyer to look at this case. Based on our initial investigation, it is evident that there is anti-competitive practices, selective bias, and unfair treatment going on in the App Store. I should state that this isn't the first time the App Store has been accused of this.",CA

One time, they told me that my Macbook had water damage so they could not retrieve my data for me since it was ‚Äúall rusted‚Äù. This was BS because my friend was able to recover everything for me weeks later. I‚Äôve had other poor customer service experiences with them, but let‚Äôs talk about the one from today. Apple had a recall / product defect with their Macbook pro where the keyboard double types letters. I was not even notified about this that I know of, and if I was there was definitely no ‚Äòdeadline‚Äô mentioned. I only found out through my friend.  In the past year, I visited apple store multiple times to get this addressed, making appointments. Once, I even started a conversation online and she helped me make the Genius Bar appointment. Each time, the Genius Bar was delayed to the point that I waited 30+ minutes at the Genius bar and then had to go home or back to work. None of these visits were logged by Apple. Maybe because I never got to talk to a ‚Äúgenius‚Äù since they were all busy.  Today, I went to the Apple store, finally made it to the Genius specialist, and they said they can‚Äôt fix my keyboard because the 4 year warranty passed 2 months ago. They saw no logs of me coming to the apple store to fix this, and said I have to contact support over the phone since they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have the power to make an exception‚Äù. Phone specialist says they have to back up the store specialists, and that they have no record of me trying to fix this before Feb 25. Phone specialist also said the in store specialist DO have the power to make exceptions, and that the log shows ‚Äúexception denied‚Äù. So they managed to log this, but not the numerous times I talked to Apple? And they lied about not ‚Äúhaving the authority to make this decision‚Äù lol. Are you kidding me? Because of your incompetent product and incompetent service and incompetent logging system, I‚Äôm stuck with your defective Macbook with a keyboard that can‚Äôt do its job. I swear I will never purchase another Apple product again, this is the absolute last straw.

It's so irritating because it's constantly telling me to buy icloud space because I'm out (without ever actually using it mind you). Next, I go to let my wife use it. But I can't turn off the fingerprint lock garbage. I try adding her as a family member sharing. It makes her go get an apple id using a credit card and everything just to not let her join because the process is so convoluted that it literally brakes. It sends her an email invite that can only be opened on an apple device, and ONLY using their proprietary email app. Then, it pops up and asks to click on the invitation - but there aren't any. So we both just wasted 30 minutes, my wife had to get an apple id and jump through all these hoops just to not have their stupid family sharing garbage work. Why lock a device I purchased. It is MY PROPERTY after I buy it. Apple acts like their tech is their property after they sell it to you at over inflated prices. So, I get on the line with support. And they cut the call then ask me to fill out a survey about whether I'll recommend them or not.

790,www.apple.com,2022-03-20T17:45:27.000Z,1,Apple Cheating!,"Apple Cheating! I would like to share my last experience with Apple. It is my first time buying something from Apple. I decided to buy IPhone 13 Pro Max. Basically, the phone's display just got dead after 2 weeks of purchasing the phone from Apple directly. I was on the way from Manchester to London. While I was on the train, the display just died. I could not use touchscreen obviously, but by luck I was able to speak to siri to call my friend and show me the ways in London. I was literally lost there at night. The next day, I went to Apple store in Westfield/Stratford where I got the most disgusting customer service experience from the team there who was just trying to dismiss the case! She was not even knowing how to disable find my phone while she calls her self as technician! She wanted to close the case by saying ""Sorry this cant be fixed and we cant help you"" It is totally not acceptable to have a phone repaired within two weeks without getting a replacement sealed in a box! totally unfair! Despite the lack of skills, she was rude! I advised her to speak with a senior as there must be a way to disable that! she went to speak with a senior after agurments with me! The senior taught her how to do that. She could just do that immediately without working on my nerves! I reported the case to her manager, it turned out he is another smug corrupted person, to the extend that he told me ""Do not try with me by reporting my staff member, we are not going to give you replacement! We are going to replace the screen and if it wont work then we will think about replacement"" I spent like ~5 hours in there. 1. Arrived the store, got a appointment after 2 hours 2. During the first appointment, troubleshooting and figuring out how to disable find my phone, by that person who calls herself a technician. 3. The phone transfered to maintenance team, gave me another appointment to come back after 2 hours, came back again after 2 hours, they said we have technical issues, come back again after 15 minutes, and then another 15 minutes. 4. Last report by them that the screen cant be fixed and the phone has to be replaced. I was happy that they decied to replace it. 5. Awaited for another 30 minutes to get the replacement and BOOM I got a phone that is wrapped in cheap nylon! I asked is that referbushed? They told me that this is a recycled phone like a new! I was just wondering how soon they got to recycle within 6 months of releasing that phone! I said but ""I should get something sealed in the box! It is only 2 weeks, this is a manfucaturing defect and a fault from Apple! They refused to gave me a sealed new device in the box and gave me a paper to sign it by IPad, I read that paper, it is just confirming that they replaced the phone without mentioning anything about the condition of the replacement. I said I will take this as temporary solution until I get back to my home in Manchester because I am literally lost her without phone. Later, I got an email from Apple stating that the replacement phone is referbushed and that the value of it is 460 GBP! I gave them a call and the case took like 2 weeks speaking with them and the managaement over the phone, repeating the case everyday to every apple staff member! Either they tell me we are differnt than the physical stores in the street and we can only help with online purchases or they tell me that you AKNOWLEDGED that the phone is referbushed based the Email I got from Apple, it states that I aknoweledged that the replacement is referbushed, though there is no signature from my side! Here comes the evidence of their cheating. The doc I got in the store states nothing related to the condition of the replacement (New or referebushed), and it has been signed by me. The Email I got from Apple states that the replacement is referbushed. They refused to replace my phone with new one because they considered me that I aknoweldged (Which has been done by cheating by hiding the fact it is referbushed) Basically, these phones that they replace, they will just repair them later and use them as replacement for other customers! There is nothing called recycling for these phones it is just a lie, it is referebushed device and they hide the fact it is referbushed until you get an Email stating that the device is referbushed because there could be a rejection from a customer to accept the phone in store thus they will be forced to issue a refund or sealed new phone as replacement in that case Everytime I ask them to issue the refund, they tell me but you aknoweledged the phone is referbushed! This explains that there is such a case where customers just refuse the replacement. I did not know about that fact and thats how they got the chance to cheat. Apple is being managed by smug people who consider themselves as on demand nowdays thus they dont care about their customers at all in addition to the cheating.",GB

Spent 1K on an order of 2 items; they split up the order without advance notification, so you are chained to an at-home delivery AND a car trip to the store. They don't allow you to combine the two in one delivery. Of course not. They are expedite and super efficient at removing the cash from your account; then the agony begins. Tranche of bonkers nonsensical emails that contain gobbledygook force you to spend time noone has on procuring contact via live chat/calls. (eg of an email - subject header implies the email is re the ipad air delivery, yet content is a load of ill spaced out, oddly random text that seems to be about the other part of the order) - and it looks like a 3 year old has gotten onto mum's computer and pressed send after jiggling around with the content, five times. Randomly plonking bits of text here and there. No joining up and no salient relevance to the order details you're seeking. Desperately seeking by now as it's day 3 after order placement and still no clue as to when and WHAT TIME the order is arriving at the home address. Hour of life spent on live chat nets varying reports re delivery details (which are missing  even up to and including the day before the delivery) - and still no clue as to the time. One girl on live chat (16.3.22- circa 6pm) suggests  - why of course I can pick one of the hourly time slots when they land in advance of the day of delivery - yet when STILL nothing has landed the day before (today) - I force myself to call in to speak to a human and find out what on earth is going on with the chaos, mess and totally at expense of the customer's sanity. Not to mention working hours drained away.... The next call nets the total opposite - yes, wait for it - the brand Apple sees fit to re introduce 50's style housewife expectations; you WILL SIT INDOORS ALL DAY, MRS, WAITING FOR ME. Apparently it's me asking a bit much - not to have to give up 8am - 8pm on a work day - because...this...is....Apple....this is how we roll. You wait on us beatch. I'm supposed to feel better about giving up 12 hours waiting on these amoral greedsters - because  - wait for it - they will tell me the hour they will deliver in. ON THE DAY! MORNING OF! Ok bye bye any plans any meetings anything at all for the whole day from 8-8pm as I won't know until tomorrow morning when the delivery will come. Yay. 2022. Hello. When even arcane old school risible brands like British Gas having to step into modern day living - and not demand customers sit in all day waiting on their arrival - this blows Apple off the stratosphere of oxymoronic; a so called TECH company - branding itself as er progressive and forward thinking - now expects us to sit in all day - waiting on them....Yikes. Reality check so big needed that it doesn't exist. Couldn't make it up. Apple - a brand that sunk the amoral abyss of capitalism gone so horribly wrong - even lower. They don't care you've spent your time, your money, your sanity, your everything on days trying to work out what on god's earth is going on with their chaotic and ridiculous delivery system (they don't have one; they are so tight they allocate the courier company the night before - they are clearly waiting on the cheapest deals on delivery) - they really couldn't give a damn about the consumer. And their blatant hubris and ****-off attitude shows they're actually quite proud of their lack of any self awareness whatsoever. A so called senior complaints manager actually suggested there was something amiss with my attitude - to raise the subject of 50's style housewife ambitions from Apple's desire for money money money - it's cheaper for them that way of course....But she wants to tell me off for telling the truth; not a comfortable concept - the truth - for Apple. They like to talk down and boy do they go far with that premise that you're the dumbo and tell you off they will, talking over you and threatening to end calls - over - the truth. Have the customer held to ransom while they spend less on efficient and commensurate delivery. She also suggested that the customers' purchasing didn't pay for either staff  nor for Apple's existence.... :) No, sure, the fairy rainbow unicorns pay salaries. The fairy rainbow unicorns are - however - certainly in charge of deliveries - if you chase them for hours, over days..... Hubris beyond belief; of course you're expected to take a day off work, of course you're expected to wait ON US - we are the MIGHTY APPLE. Sit down and shut up little woman - was my lot. By a woman. #shame They employ a company just to deal with complaints. Not entirely convinced it's the right one. My lost working day and hours spent on chasing up the order are - she agrees - worthy of invoicing. 'They won't care' are her final words on the complaint I raise.

The review should (and would) be FIVE STAR, if it wasn't for some of Apple's apparent intransigence. Feedback below given to Apple on a recent interaction. The advisor Kevin was great, friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. The system somewhat less so.  Firstly, the automated system is not fit for purpose in any way shape or form! Considering where we are present day, with voice recognition, your automated system seems rooted somewhere in the late 1980s! It never has any idea what is being requested, which always results in me (and probably many others) just shouting obscenities at it! And then normally ending up at the wrong department, therefore wasting an advisor's time and further frustrating valued customers! Secondly, and even more importantly, I have all my music (a lifetime's music) purchased legitimately, so therefore mine, to do whatever I wish, within the realms of the law, that is now stuck on my iPhone and cannot be transferred back to my very expensive, new, top of the range custom order iMac!!! This is due to my old iMac, just stopping working! There needs to be an easy way to recover data from a malfunctioning Mac and more importantly, Apple need to make available the sort of 3rd party programmes that there are out there, for eventualities such as this! Please listen to your customers! We are personally, Apple aficionados, we have EVERY Apple product there is! We intend to stay Apple customers for ever, but that doesn't mean that we will. How can Apple leave some of their best customers (ie best advertising stream) feeling frustrated and angry? Come on Apple, must do better for the customers that you already have, and then, spend the astronomical budgets attracting others. Word of mouth and customer satisfaction is KING! Perhaps (if you don't already have) create a pool of committed, confirmed Apple users, for genuine feedback, instead of a bunch of highly paid statistic massagers! Who are probably reading these comments. And we all know that turkeys don't vote for Christmas.",GB

I just experienced the worst shopping experience I've ever had in my life. After my phone got lost in transit apple couldn't let me go to the store and just pick up the phone from the store because it was an online order. After calling back and forth between ups and Apple for 3 days. Someone finally told me that my phone had got lost in transit.. they sent me a new phone, after 6 days. As soon as I receive the phone I noticed that the phone was too small for me so I called them and ask them if I can go in the store and exchange for a different phone. Of which at the time they told me that they couldn't do it. that the only thing they could do is send me a refund. What the representative didn't mention is that I had to wait until after apple received the phone for them to be issue a refund. When the representative sent me the shipping label after reading the shipping label it stated three steps for me to get my refund.1 print the label, 2 take the phone to the UPS, once we receive the phone we will refund you. So in the end I ended up having to drive in traffic for 45 minutes to Apple store just so that I can return the package. After paying $860 for a phone they wanted me to just go ahead and purchase a new phone and wait for the money to come back to me. Some of us just don't have $800 just sitting around. Apple really needs to train their customer service Representatives. So now I have to wait for 5 days  until I get my refund to get a new phone.

I'm a very calm person and this is the first time I've ever complained about any service ever ever üôÅ. I'm writing this for potential new or current Apple customers to shed light on how Apple treats their customers in after-sales, I just feel like it's just the right thing to do. The story: I went to the official Apple store in Berlin to get a screen crack on my #iPhone (I assume the most common issue) repaired. After talking to someone for 15 minutes they kept my phone and told me to come back in 1h and pay the 29‚Ç¨ since I have Apple Care+ for that phone. When I came back, they tell me they discovered some unexpected water damage in the phone (which I assume could have come from showing the QR-code for the Genius bar appointment outside - it was raining and I had a cracked screen after all..). The problem: After the ""repair"" half of the screen of the before-perfectly-working phone now doesn't work anymore, which makes the phone practically unusable. They say I need to replace the complete phone for 99‚Ç¨, which I find disappointing, but am willing to do. However they don't actually have a phone in the store and I should come back in 2-3 days to get and pay for my replacement. So effectively they're telling me: Sorry, but please get lost with a phone that we completely broke and live without a phone for 2-3 days. Obviously this is a problem / impossible in today's world for both work and personal life! So I ask for a replacement phone for the 2-3 days: Nope. I ask whether the other Apple Store in the city (far away) could help me: They cannot say and won't even tell me whether they have a phone in store, but expect me to just go and hope. They refuse to call and ask them, because it's not the policy. I ask to speak to the store manager: They send someone who tries to pretend to be the store manager, who tells me to just accept it. I ask for the real store manager: A women called Ulrike (she refuses to tell me her last name) comes and claims to be the real store manager. I explain the situation and she just says there is nothing she can do (including not connected me with someone higher up, who could solve the problem). At this point I'm actually just very confused and sad. I cannot believe that this is the way Apple treats a customer that has spent ‚Ç¨10k+ on Apple products privately during his life, not even counting using and evangelising their products at work. I actually love Apple products from both a design and product perspective and I also work in tech so I know, or at least hope, that HQ Apple would hate to see their customers be treated this way. I'm honestly just so confused, sad, and disappointed. I still cannot believe what just happened, I'm an business owner myself and I (and I hope every other business owner) would never-ever-ever treat customers this way. The most ironic part: I'm writing this from my (Apple!) MacBook Pro, since my phone doesn't work... Sorry for the long post and thanks for reading. Hope this helps potential future Apple customers know where they stand when they have a problem that doesn't fall into the Apple standard processes. I'm just sad that the most valuable company in the world treats its' customers this way. I guess shareholder value > customer value üò¢",DE

They replaced first one airpod, the the second, then the case, then did firmware updates and still they drop calls, switch between devices when not meant to, and Apple does nothing to truly fix the problem.  I bought the AirPods at an airport shop after my original AirPods stopped holding a charge (they were old, and no complaints, those had worked well for several years). Apple uses this excuse to not stand 100% behind their product. Very poor. When Apple does this, they lose the reason people are willing to pay a premium.

He carried out a diagnostics test which clarified why my iPhone was not working properly and gave me suggestions and his considered opinion as to what my best course of action should be.  As I am 75-year old pensioner and not very technically-savvy, his guidance was invaluable and he assured me throughout our conversation that he was only doing his job in taking the time and making the effort to solve my problem.

Although their products were significantly more expensive than other brands, I kept buying iPhone after iPhone and iPad after iPad, plus iWatch and other accessories... Until last year when I got disgusted by their greed.  My last iPad Pro just stopped working after 2 years and 1 month. People were telling me before that they sell products with just the right amount of defects or low-quality parts so they stop working 3 years after they are been bought, but this time this expensive piece of garbage didn't even reach 2 years and a half. Before it shut down forever, it would discharge in about 40 minutes of usage, which completely defeats the purpose of having a mobile device. I had to walk around the office with a changer and prey I found an outlet that's not taken by other Apple users. Same with my last iPhone.  What is the purpose of having a mobile phone if it won't last you at least while you are at the office??? In 2020 I decided that I am not going to give them another chance of ripping me off and I bought a Samsung tablet and phone. I can finally use my mobile devices away from the outlet.

873,www.apple.com,2022-02-03T16:32:49.000Z,1,Won't get fooled again !!,"Won't get fooled again !! The following is my reply to Apple after they asked for 'feedback' following my recent visit to one of their 'genius' bars. I am an ex Apple engineer and I will not waste money on another one of their cynical 'nerd traps' Take my advice there are better , cheaper alternatives to paying double for faulty goods and being slapped in the face if you complain. This is my feedback: ------------------------------------------------------------- After being told I would have to pay something like ¬£10 for a magsafe charger replacement . by one of Jack's colleagues. (One of 4 magsafes I have that were constructed with sub standard cable which has frayed and constitutes a shock hazard) I was then told by XXXX that it would cost ¬£56 to replace the faulty product that Apple sold to me in the first place. I was astounded that a 'replacement' was almost the price of buying a new one. I was an Apple hardware engineer in my past and have owned a new mac desktop or laptop or phone every couple of years since my first SE30 and 3GS phone. I am now changing all of my gear to Android and Linux products because frankly Apple products are overpriced and in my time as a user I have watched (with horror) the way the company has become arrogant and dismissive of it's loyal customers. Other products are available and I will urge anyone in the future to not even consider an Apple item because they are bad value for money and the attitude to customers with problems absolutely stinks. (Before Apple gets on it's high horse about this only being my 'opinion' I would like to remind them that I used to organise spares and replacements in the 90s) -I never signed a non disclosure agreement about their practices so if anyone wants to ask me how cynical their operation is ,- get in touch! Lets get this in perspective, at one point a few years ago I had 2 dead Macbook Pro13""s with faulty graphics that Apple refused to acknowledge as a problem. I also had 2 Ipads that had shut down. Another problem Apple would not acknowledge. Nearly ¬£4000 of equipment that died within 2 years of purchase! The solution apparently was to buy a large amount of Applecare to protect me against the faulty products Apple had sold me. I would respect you more if you supplied a roll of insulating tape with your products as most of your loyal customers have to buy their own. PM",GB

The person I talked to told me that he was not the one manufacturing the device, forgetting that he was representing Apple at that time.  To cut it short, if you buy Apple devices, don't assume that they would have protection against water. It does not work. If some water comes, they always say ""it's water damage, you have to pay for it"". Simple as that.",GB

Two weeks ago I visited the Apple Store in Booragoon Perth to have my screen fixed. The screen was fixed in about an hour and the phone was ready at the promised time. I bought and installed a screen protector but then after I got home, realised that I could no longer hear callers unless they were on speaker. So back to the store to have this issue checked After a diagnostic was performed, a faulty speaker was identified and a new screen booked in, same deal as last time, and a new screen protector was going to be added at no cost to me. When I went back to the store at the promised time to collect the phone, it wasn‚Äôt ready and I was directed to a table to wait. This table had no chairs and I waited 30 mins, then found someone to chase up my phone and the phone arrived, all fine and the speaker issue fixed but no screen protector, so this was then done. At all times the Apple team were lovely. BUT at no point did anyone applogise for the inconvenience to me of having to take time out of my day and drive an hour back to the store, nor did they apologise for having me wait 30 mins past my promised pick up time nor did they apologise for not having the screen protector done as promised. I‚Äôm a long time Apple lover, with 20 Apple products at my business but I just felt that an apology or a glass of water while waiting or a regular check in while I was waiting would have gone a long way. I‚Äôm just left feeling that on this Occassion Apple have not put the love into me, their customer, that I have put into their products for such a long time",AU

I said to the guy you must know that the update has damaged the phone,,, he would not reply just wanted the money. There were also other customers with the exact same problem.

916,www.apple.com,2022-01-15T20:13:26.000Z,1,Apple is the biggest thief in the technology sector with their loopholes. BE AWARE!!!,"My review may sound very frustrating and that is because Apple has designed obvious loopholes in their system to steal from their customers. Here goes my story with them. I financed an Apple 13 pro and I got Apple Care+ with Theft and Loss which should cover your phone if it is lost. While traveling we were put to sleep and robbed at our Airbnb and our phones were stolen. When I tried to log in to my account, my phone was put into something that Apple calls ""Recovery Mode"" and they cut my access from my account for 18 days because people who stole it, tried to get into the phone and for security reasons, Apple put my account on such a long non-sense hold. After the 18 days was over, I logged into my account and my device was not showing under my account. Of course the thieves were not sitting around for me to log in and find their location. They either jalbroke my phone, or they took it into pieces and used the hardware.  Here is Apple's loophole. In order to file a lost phone claim, I have to log into my account and put the phone in ""Lost Mode"" but this is not an option because for no reason my phone had disappeared and does not show on my account. How is that under my control? They are saying that I might have turn the ""Find My Phone"" option off which I never did. The funny fact is that when you turn that off, Apple sends you an email that the option was turned off. I never received that email and Apple knows that because they keep the record of everything in their system. In the end, Apple is telling me to go F*** myself because of their loophole I cant file a claim and the $1200 phone is gone. What is the point of getting insurance? I am switching from Apple after more than 10 years because their customer service and their ethics of business are disgusting. Apple gave 18 days to the thieves to do whatever they want so I have to go back and buy another phone from them. So unfair, so wrong. The fact is that I have insurance and my phone is stolen from me and the insurance has to cover it. Now the way to file is defined by Apple in a way for them to benefit from this. My case simply has to be filed manually because it is an error on Apple's system for not showing my device.",US

I had purchased a Apple product and spoke had taken the money out of my account, I went there and waiting fir the product because I had a time slot ( why give time slots when they work on their own time or in that bs of when second email is received you can collect your product) anyways I waited and went to the Apple desk at fairview mall and the girl lady said to me that she can see that the item is purchased but unable to let it out maybe because of waiting on the preparation of the product so I thought okay I‚Äôll com back in a while , I sat at the mall waited and at that time I started ringing customer service to see what‚Äôs happening after I went to Apple desk for a second to third time I was told to call 1800myApple which I did, they man spoke to said everything is fine I even had him on the phone to the lady at the Apple desk, still the lady said it don‚Äôt seems like it‚Äôs ready maybe something to do with my bank , which it wasn‚Äôt because Apple already took my money out my account. Cut a long story short, Apple had cancelled my order and didn‚Äôt even had the decency or respect to tell me or contact me to notify me of this, I waited so long and not one Apple customer service was able to tell me what the problem was and why was my purchase cancelled, each person told me something different because they don‚Äôt know s**t about s**t, If you Apple customer service reps don‚Äôt know how to do your jobs please just don‚Äôt go into this field of work  and waste peoples time or just educate yourself more on your product or policy producer and the way Apple works etch Apple have all these pc and systems  etc and not one person can tell me what the hell happened.

Strap kept coming loose and after only a few days does so again, watch drops and cracks screen on impact with the ground. Looked online to find similar customer experiences. Complained to apple that strap was not fit for purpose with description, supplied photos, her appleID so they can see her brand loyalty,  who has been buying their overpriced stuff for 10 yrs if not more. Replied and said there was insufficient evidence to make a claim. Why, as fate would have it, on this occasion we weren't video-recording her wrist walking from A to B. I didn't expect them to replace or offer free or even lower priced repair as a gesture of goodwill but good to confirm and seal the suspicion and disappointment. Why try to redesign the wheel? Have been wearing real watches all my life and never had a strap which failed to keep the watch where it should be, hence this 'design' is not worthy of the name, though maybe that's why they couldn't call it a strap. An overpriced lump of rubber, better used to turn into dishwashing gloves or condoms. Added a star as the strap is nice and smooth to the touch, no itches or rashes, always a welcome feature.",AU

I was with the best network in Canada, Bell. I didn't make many calls in the beginning and didn't notice it. I spent hours on the chat & call with them troubleshooting the issue.

And if I wanted it quickly, I would have to pay the upgraded shipping... I would completely understand if I made the mistake and ordered the wrong device.  But when YOUR SITE says it has specific features, and it DOES NOT, that's FALSE ADVERTISING!

But over the past 10 years, the company has turned into a greedy conglomerate. Many would argue they were already a greedy conglomerate, but their latest practices are unforgivable. New iPhones don‚Äôt include a charger, or even a cord. Customers are forced to buy them separately, even though the iPhone cannot work without them. This would be the equivalent of buying an automobile, but having to purchase the gas tank and fuel pump separately. Earbuds disappeared years ago, along with the connector, prompting customers to buy outrageously priced wireless ones. Yet through all the things Apple has removed, their prices continue to skyrocket. The iPad 13 Pro Max sells for an outrageous $1,599. (Plus an additional $58 for that power adapter and charger that aren‚Äôt included.) For over five years, Apple has sold computers with defective, low-quality keyboards. Customers are now realizing that the storage inside them wears out after a few years, and cannot be repaired, at any cost. So Apple‚Äôs claim of being environmentally friendly is utter nonsense. After a few years, today‚Äôs new Mac will be completely worthless. Throw the whole thing away and buy another. Apple‚Äôs products can no longer be modified, upgraded, or repaired. They just wear out, turning into an environmental disaster. The last computer I bought was a used, 2015 model MacBook. It‚Äôs far superior to their new ones, in that it can be upgraded, and doesn‚Äôt need to be tossed into the trash after a few years.

Finally the store manager comes out. Explains that they are short staffed (not my problem) When I asked about all the staff standing around he said they were waiting for appointments to arrive. After more conversation and debate he finally allowed me in simply to look at a MacBook.  Had my look and left. I returned maybe 30 minutes later with my partner (who the laptop is for) to get her view on screen size.  Quite a line of people in front of the store this time. Explained nicely to a security guy and a staff member that I just wanted to show my parter the MacBook screen size. Didn‚Äôt need anyone to assist. Refused entry to the store! We probably have about $100k of Apple products in our home and business.  I was more than annoyed. Apple - if you can‚Äôt run a store, close it!

I keep them regularly updated to the latest models. As I do so I am continually dissatisfied with what I find. I could write a list of dislikes that would fill many pages. In the past few months I upgraded my iMac to a 2020 model from a 2014 model, expecting it to be a whiz-bang. It is not. My feeling is that I have not improved my situation one iota. That move cost me ¬£2000. In the past week I upgraded my MacBook Pro from a 2018 model to a 2021 model and I feel the same. I thought  the new M1 chip would be transformational. It is not. There are too many points of dissatisfaction to list them all here, though I would do so if asked. Where has all the speed gone? The security aspects of setting up new hardware are horrendous. Even the once-simple process of migrating has become a nightmare. As an IT professional, I cannot see how ordinary people cope with all this! My MacBook Pro cost me ¬£1800 and the cash back for a trade-in was ¬£240. This is really not worth it. I have had constant issues with the OS - constantly being asked to put in passwords and security codes. This is all SO unsatisfactory. My son converted me to Apple by saying, ‚ÄúDad, Apple just works!‚Äù He was right in 2005, but not any more.

Again I explained I was exempt from wearing any covering on my face. The advisor said that if I did not wear a facecovering I would not be allowed in store to make my purchase.   This is against the law which clearly shows on the Government website and states. To insist that I disclose why is a breach of section 29 (5) (a) of the Equality Act 2010. To deny me entry and/or service is a breach of section 13 (1) of the Equality Act 2010. Not all disabilities are visible.

After a very lengthy phone call they are saying the volume switch has corrosion and seems to point to some sort of water damage? The phone has never been immersed or for that point anywhere near water and if you look online you will find a vast amount of similar problems with the iPhone 11. Obviously they didn‚Äôt get things right and are making loyal customers pay for it. I requested the phone back and what an incompetent service as the courier reported that insufficient address details were on the parcel. After a long telephone conversation with DHL, I was offered to go to pick the phone up from their Enfield depot. I turned up at 8pm and guess what no parcel, after an hour wait I was told to re attend the next morning in which I did only to waste another 2 hours as with the missing full address sent by Apple it made things very difficult. How about this the phone returned with deep scratches where it was opened and not put together back properly.

I wanted to order it to be delivered to the store, so I can pick it up but there was no such option. A message popped up saying that I will be able to edit my delivery address after I purchase the order which I was not allowed to do without an Apple ID. I tried to create one, but it would not allow me to use my email for the registration, hence I couldn't create it. I chatted with someone who was useless, then called and was told they can't deliver my watch to the store and that's it - they ""just don't do that"". The person was extremely rude. At this point I have already explained the same situation to 3 different people and spent 2 hours on calls and chats with them while they were telling me I wasn't able to order for store pick up because the store didn't have the item which was something I was well aware of and explained to them every time but still had to listen to it every time I spoke to someone new. After this conversation I decided to chat someone and ask them to send the watch to my work instead. Of course this option was not possible either and I had to cancel the order and reorder it again. Horrible customer service, delivery rules that make no sense, bugs on the website - never again.",US

Apple has decided that DHL is the company that will take care of the delivery. DHL can make the delivery on a day where I am unfortunately traveling. I arrange for DHL to deliver at a service point, such that I can pickup the MacBook at the service point. DHL sends me a text message that the package has been delivered to the service point. Next morning, I receive a text that my parcel is out for delivery again. I go to the service point, and indeed the parcel is not at the service point and has never been at the service point. I call DHL and the customer support person says he will make sure the parcel is delivered to another service point the same day. The parcel will be there no later than 4:30 PM. Around 6 PM, I still haven't received a text and call DHL again. The (different) customer support person tells me that the parcel won't be delivered until tomorrow as I have asked for an address change, which always causes the package to be delivered no earlier than the next day. Long story short, the parcel is still in transit as DHL can't get this organised. When Apple sends my packages with UPS, I never have any trouble. This is the third time that they chose DHL, and it is the third time with trouble. Last time it took over a week to get my iPhone delivered. Not sure how long it will take this time.",NL

1115,www.apple.com,2021-11-10T19:16:12.000Z,1,"Company is not able to give or receive phone calls, but demands them. The company is about 100 years behind the times and is not up to date with modern technologies such as how to use a phone","In attempting to sign up for a simple payment processing service I found that Apple, Inc. seems to be particularly challenged specifically in the fields of telecommunications and technologies.  Matters that seem to be relatively simple and straight forward when dealing with any other business, from a startup small business on up to a Fortune 500 company, are apparently very difficult or impossible for Apple to accomplish. It appears that Apple is not familiar with elements of modern technology, specifically in regards to how to give and receive phone calls or communications over the internet. Of all of the companies I have dealt with for the past decade or so, the company which has shown itself to be the most technically challenged and behind-the-times in the fields of internet technology and telecommunications, is Apple, Inc. Specifically: 1. I signed up online for an Apple developer account, which was the first step to getting a payment processing account. 2. I then received an email stating that the application could not be completed without a phone call.  This is a dated technology (phone communications). Such dated technology is not usually needed by modern corporations familiar with 21st internet technologies used for long distance communications.  Even in the case where a face-to-face meeting is desired for verification purposes, we have numerous methods of accomplishing this which are far more advanced than telephones. 3. Nevertheless, I set aside a time to call Apple, despite recognizing that this company is behind the times. 4. When I attempted to contact Apple, I found that they had other issues.  There is no phone number to call.  The only way to contact them is to go online and submit a request for them to contact me. 5. Despite this outdated technology and hassle, I input my phone number and waited for their call. 6. I attempted this numerous times. On some occasions, my phone rang but when I answered and responded, I heard only silence.  On other occasions, the phone did not ring at all and I then received an email that Apple was ""trying to reach me.""   7. I contacted Apple by email and requested to have their phone number so that I could call them, since they were not able to call me. 8. Apple support then told me that they do not have a phone number to receive calls.  (Another indicator that this company is about 100 years behind modern times: they are demanding a phone call, but have no number.) 9. I again made an appointment for Apple to call me. 10. I arranged my schedule and made myself available for the call.  Again, the same pattern repeated. On some occasions, the phone rang, I picked up and answered, and heard silence.  On other occasions, the phone did not ring at all and I got an email saying ""we're trying to reach you."" 11. I made another appointment.  I gave another number. I waited for the call.  The phone was sitting by me and did not ring.  There was no missed call. I received an email from Apple, stating that they had called and could not get through. I can see that Apple, Inc. is at least a few decades out of date.  It should probably get itself up to speed with modern technologies, such as how to use a telephone, and what internet technology is.  I am able to work with any other business, whether it is a bank or an ice cream shop.  I can give and receive calls and I can sign up for new services online. In the last 10 years or more, the only company I have encountered that is so technically challenged in the fields of Internet Technology and Telecommunications is Apple, Inc.",US

I found that my warranties for my apple care plus will expired in 2022.  First of all, I came to see the first level of staff named Josh with my receives . Unfortunately, I was not allowed to go to the next level of service by Josh. He didn't took a close look at those and made me a surprise; He said my cables are not covered as only devices are covered even he didn‚Äôt reviewed my receives. I said he was wrong and said I bough Apple Care Plus. After a very quick look about 2 seconds he made a decision that my cables are not coved under the plan and consider my cables have physical damages and not asking why and what happened.  As an expert, he already knows the its problem that many user have face about the I phone lighting cable rubber is wear off and corrode after 3 to six months of used. Of course, I am not agree and asked to talk to a supervisor.  After few minutes Janet and Eric came. Once again, Janet made me another surprise as she said the only device is covered and said I purchased the products in 2019 and warranties are expired. I told and show her that I have the Apple Care Plus on my both receives.  Eric and Janet then took a look on my USB C cable for my Mac book only and show the pictures and said it not covered. Even they are not looking and investigate on my lightning cable charger for my I phone even I explained to them that in the past, I came to the store to had replaced my lightning cable charger for my I phone caused the ruble wear off on several places on the cable as same as I have today. I have to covered over it with some tapped for temporary and for safety purpose and wait until the COIVID is ease a little bit. I did that as I‚Äôm concern about the safety reason as it may caused fire or electrical shock while charging it.   I came to the store for same problem for my lightning cable charger for my I phone and my USB C for my Mac. Once again, I‚Äôm not satisfy with the decision and I asked if She or Eric can write a note on the receives the reason that they refuse to exchange the cable. They refuse it and ask me to show the serials number on both of my receives that she can write something on the file. Of course, I also refuse as I‚Äôm still not satisfying with her decision.  I asked if can talk to their supervisor or manager of the store. Janet said she and Eric are supervisors here.  I asked how about if I can talk to the manager. She said the store manager is not in the store.  I asked them; I would like to make a complaint about the store and who I can make a complaint. Janet said I can talk with her and Eric.   My question is;  if somebody were me does She / He does believe the complaint will be treated fairly and transparency or they will write or do something that I don‚Äôt know? Do I still trust the service from this store in general?  Please note here, She and Eric said that I got  my lightning cable for my I phone replaced by a chance or that person gave me the first chance to replace it. She also suggested that I may call support and they may send a replace by chance. For sure, I‚Äôm not happy and not satisfy with that. I also asked if I could have their names that I will write something about this on my comments and review? They are OK with that and gave me their names. I would like to thanks to them.

Apple swear blind that these were authorised by an iPhone 6 that belonged to my daughter. I took the phone, switched it off and locked it a my safe....the unauthorised activity continued for a while until I removed the iPhone 6 and my payment method from the account. A few payments were refunded, then the money taken back for most of them, leaving me ¬£170 out of pocket. A few months later it started up again. No payment method had been entered on the account and yet my debit card was chaged another ¬£169. This would have been much higher if I had not alerted my bank and had payments to Apple blocked. Apple Support was useless. Their agent Noel even put forward the theory that someone was accessing my Apple account, despite me changing the password several times and adopting 2 stage verification, entering my debit card details, making purchases, then deleting the debit card number until the next time. I asked how this was possible given the 2 stage verification, frequent change of password etc.No explanation was offered. I next spoke to Marcel who had a further bizarre theory that my daughter's old phone may have been cloned. This still did not answer the tricky question of getting past the 2 stage verification on my account. Next I was put through to a manager called Nicky. She was  sympathetic and superficially helpful. It turns out that Apple refund requests are not dealt with by humans but by an algorithm. In my case one refund would be approved and the next 6 denied. In classic Little Britain fashion 'the computer says no'. All Nicky could do was to suggest I take it up with my bank. Apple plays snakes and ladders with banks, giving money back with one hand, when challenged, then recharging the account a few days later when the computer says no again. It is like communicating with the members of some strange cult whose sole aim is to relieve you of your hard earned money. I have lost count of the number of hours I have wasted over this issue in the past 4 months. It seems that Apple banks on you giving up any refund claim or suggestion that their system is not secure, through shere frustration. A truly dreadful company that I will never deal with again.",GB

Frequent useless updates that tend to remove and hide features. Old tutorials that are just months old often lead you to nowhere. There was a setting in Pinyin Chinese that allows the mac to ignore the letter 'g', after the update, I can't find it (I went to the Apple Store and they still can't find it). 2. Disorganized file structure. It may seem clean at first, but if you are trying to delete all files related to a software like Xcode, you will find there are hundreds of them laying in many different folders. You can delete some of them. For others you can't even move them. And the Apple technician told me to delete all of them. 3. Equating unreliable new features as innovation. For whatever reason, my touchbar flashes about every 1 minute. And there is the butterfly keyboard that jams and typessss several characters at a time. 4. Slow and unprofessional support. So I tried to use the Apple Care to solve some of those issues. I tried to chat with them online 1st but they are not specialized in Xcode (my 2nd pt). I scheduled and went to an Apple shop and that person is still not specialized. They said they would call back and email me, but absolutely nothing happened. I ended up factory reset my mac after spending hours trying to do what I said in pt 2. 5. Child porn iPhone news. No elaboration needed. 6. Frequent slowing down of speed (for mac) accompanied by loud sound of the fans and heating up. Sometimes random weird stuff would happen if you haven't restarted your mac for some time like Finder deciding you have no permission to open and change files you created. It is not a secret that Apple slows down old models before releasing new models of iPhone. 7. Doesn't support most games. 8. Bluetooth feature (between mac and iPhone) that doesn't work most of the time. It all depends on the mood of the mac if it lets your iPhone find it and airdrop a file. 9. App issues. For example, Textedit issues like when you created a table and tried to enter something it becomes like this ""imgur. c0m Slash a Slash BOhpEtA"". Another example: Xcode prompted me to auto fix a line in the C++ library (not my own code) and proceeded to tell me I can't do that.",US

At the end of January 2021, the Macbook screen was black with coloured vertical lines when I turned it on. It was returned to Apple who replaced the screen. In August 2021, the same thing happened. I used the PC in the morning and then left it on the table whilst I walked my dogs. On my return, I turned the PC on to find the same fault that occurred before. I called and spoke to Apple who tried to fix the problem over the phone. The attempt was unsucessful, Apple said that because the Macbook was now 14 months old, it was outside of the guarantee but it seemed there was a hardward problem. The Macbook was returned to JLP. I've just received a call from JLP to tell me that an Apple engineer has inspected the Macbook and found a 'pressure crack' in the screen causing an LCD bleed and this is not covered by their guarantee. The crack could have been caused by extreme heat or being banged. It was neither - no-one was at my home. The person I spoke to tried to insinuate that my labradors could have jumped on the table and damaged the laptop!! This is total nonsense, they can't get to the table and were out with me. The PC was also in a protective case to preserve the outer case from scratches. I live alone, use my PC carefully. I've used MacBooks for over 20 years and never had a problem yet this one has developed the same fault twice in 6 months.

Has the product been tested? If yes. By who? How do I charge my iPhone? How do I insert the memory card of my pro camera? No question ... This product is a shame!

What to simplify our life? I always buy Apple, but I had to write all of these points because it's really making fun of the consumer: - Very nice closed object, the coating of which still leaves far too many traces and fingerprints. A square of fabric suitable for the maintenance of this luxury product should be provided. - Screen light adaptation is not subtle enough. It goes through shades of green, red, blue and yellow every second. It‚Äôs disturbing when you are working. The variation is poorly managed. - The fixed front icon of ""managing windows open in the background"", in my opinion the most useful tool, has disappeared. You have to go look for it in the touchscreen sidebar - The tactile sidebar is too small for the fingers (I am female). It‚Äôs a genuinely useless, time-wasting gadget. It‚Äôs really giving crumbs when Apple can do better than that. In this case, the entire keyboard should be tactile, including the customisable sidebar (example: touch bar for managing ‚Äúfixed icon‚Äù windows). The touchscreen should be a highlight expected in 2021, for an Apple product with the integrated 3D option, justifying the price. Thank you",GB

The next option was to allow them to place a $1,200.00 hold on our account to ship a replacement to us and then release the hold when they received the n√©e device and got around to removing the hold. Not going to happen apple nice try!  Option 3 is now we are doing away with all apple products in our home and going with google.. apple did 81 billion in sales and can‚Äôt replace a phone that came cracked poor business if you ask me..

Thinking I could just make an appointment on their website, something a tech giant should be able to figure out, I was met with a security screen that asked for me to log into my Apple ID to make an appointment. To my surprise, my quest for getting a new phone required a verification code sent to my phone that I was trying to fix. I then had my dad call to make an appointment so that I could get in as soon as possible.  So today I went in and got my new phone. After paying over 1000$ I left the store only to find out that they again had changed the charging port for the usb but this time the other end and made me return to buy a wall port that could accommodate it. So more money down the drain. Once my phone was charged, it asked me to log onto my Apple ID which yet again, required me to put in a verification code sent to a phone that won‚Äôt turn on. At this point, I don‚Äôt know if Apple even knows what technology is supposed to do: Make life easier for people. After a lot more back and forth and getting no where, I was being told to buy another thing. At this point, I told them that if they don‚Äôt get this phone open, I was returning the phone and getting an android. It was only until then that they finally got me a working phone.

Firstly, a customer service representative from Amsterdam Apple Support offered to send me again a new one (for the 3rd time after the same occurred a year ago) but since this seems a factory defect, I wanted instead to have a different version of it. This worker's supervisor, Ben, stated that since 1 year of warranty has passed they can only repair it at my own costs (basically worse and entirely different story than what his colleague said minutes ago).  Obviously, Apple Amsterdam doesn't know the basics of marketing, that customer is always right and secondly Ben thinks that we pay 220 euro to use a product only for a year and also he offers a different solution to the problem (ask me to pay for Apple's factory defect). They speak about warranty while they sell defective items to Apple customers to force us to spend the same money every year. As a person who owns almost all types of Apple products, I am not going to spend a cent on Apple products especially in Amsterdam anymore. Given that the same exact defect happened to me with the same item version, this makes me also question the originality of the items Apple store sells in the Netherlands.",NL

When I took my phone into Apple Store on Regent's Street I was immediately told there was nothing that could be done and then bulldozed into buying a new phone for ¬£500. This new phone does nothing more than my 8 Plus and is in faact more fiddly. I've had to spend hours of my time on the phone to banks trying to re-set up apps and lost loads of data and passwords. In short it's been a waste of time and money and extremely frustrating.  I don't understand how a technical product such as an Iphone which was working absolutely fine can suddenly stop connecting to wifi, rendering it useless. It appears to be a CON in order to get money from customers who haven't upgraded their phone in a while. This is really unethical and unacceptable.

MacBook Pro Touch! Latest air pods! Several Apple watches! Latest Apple pencil! And 2 weeks ago my partner purchased a hermes apple watch online to be given a delivery date of today and the day after to receive a tracking alert to say that the item had been collected in China and to select alert options which we did and then nothing for nearly 2 weeks & no change in the tracking status so we called DHL Express who quite honestly admitted it didn't look good and that it appeared that since being collected from China it had completely disappeared! No scans at all & that we should immediately make Apple aware that they needed to immediately begin an investigation! Called Apple and spoke to several advisers & a manager & none of them would have it at all insiting they had tracking info that stated it was DEFINITELY going to be delivered to me on the 26th July (which DHL Express were shocked to hear as their systems were more detailed & they couldn't find that information) I argued & argued & argued and they insisted it would arrive with me today! I even had a manager named Anneget say she was taking ownership of this & would keep us fully informed needless to say that was another lie because not only did she not 'keep us informed' but she also ignored all our emails requesting an update on the status! ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è So when it hadn't arrived today and I couldn't get a response from Anneget I rang Apple and first call they cut me off after asking how we help you then went through a real rigmorole to speak to another woman called Sophia for her to say 'I don't know why DHL are being so negative as I can see it is on track to be with you today!' At which point I asked her where was the last place this item was located for her to look again & say oh I need to escalate this as your not receiving this item today? What the??? She had just insisted that I would seconds before just like the rest of them had all week! Anyway when I got annoyed at this and dared to ask have Apple outsourced the customer care as in the past I had been put through to a call hub in either England or Usa she then switched on me and said 'oh right is this just because I'm not English then? Is that the problem yeah? NO! The problem is Apple have taken ¬£1400 for an item they have not delivered and not just that but been downright rude & unhelpful over it too! And told lie after lie after lie! The reason I have always chosen Apple over everything else in the past was due to their exceptional customer service but I dont know when or where it all went wrong but its gone terribly wrong & I will never ever ever buy another Apple product as long as I live!

I had it repaired by an authorized Apple repair center because the laptop was covered under warranty. The Apple store rep did mention the repair may erase my data (not all of it was backed up); however, they never mentioned that I would not get any of my old parts back! Also, the laptop was returned in under a week which leads me to believe they never even attempted to retrieve my data from the hard drive or may have no way to do it. I wouldn't know because none of those details were mentioned on the product repair summary slip returned with my laptop! This is a problem because the hard drive (which stores sensitive data) is now welded to the logic boards on the new Apple laptops (the old Apple laptops internally stored them separately). I did not learn this until recently that the hard drive is attached to the logic board on the new laptops and all housed together. But why would they keep the old part(s) and not send it back to me, the customer and rightful owner of the part, nor tell me why? Perhaps if I had received my old part(s) back then I could have retrieved my data! Since several parts are ""all in one"" now, how do I know what was broke and what was ok?? They certainly never provided me those details. Not to mention, what did the ""authorized Apple repair center"" do with my old logic board/hard drive?? That hard drive contained sensitive financial and personal data on it, so why not tell the customer what happens to their old parts, especially parts that house sensitive data?? I did contact Apple support and they basically said once you sign off to have the repair done, they get to keep your old part(s) and erase your data and never give any details as to what really happened or what went wrong! At least with a car repair, the customer can request to get their old parts back! I'm beyond angry to the point that I do not see a future with Apple, at least not where laptop products are concerned! They can/should do better!!",US

I just used it to help myself in my job, she kept repeating talk to your job administrator, then I informed her that I was an apple care customer and requested that she schedule an appointment for me. She asked for my  serial number then said she didn't recognize it as an apple product and that she could not help me anymore. I said my problem is with iCloud and gave her my Mac serial number , then she said we chatted about an iPad , so she couldn't help. this conversation had gone on very long with her not reading or understanding my problem, and sending more links that had nothing to do with my issue. I told her I would report her and she sent a link for feedback about apple products not service. I hung up on her and scheduled a call back myself on the site which I had asked her to do.

I said I hope now you are working with apple and that you will try to help me. But she sent another link showing hoe to reset my password.

There was a time I was ready to get a tattoo of the logo on my heart to show my devotion. I used to sell them to people as an Apple seller with 150% belief that it was the BEST computer on earth. Today not so much.  I bought a brand new iMac retina 27"" desk top from Apple.ca with upgrades which cost me 8K when said and done. It took over 2 weeks to get delivered (from china!) But I thought worth the wait. Once here I unboxed it, turned it on to install my basic needs, email plus Adobe  creative cloud. About 30 minutes of use, before I shut it off, unplugged it and put it aside as I set up my new office space to accommodate it. 2 weeks later when my office was ready I plugged it in and....DEAD. No sign of life what so ever. And the fun begins! I called Apple care which I had bought for an additional 350 dollars. Spoke to individual who made me do a bunch of useless plug in and unplugging steps over and over even though I repeatedly told them it does not turn on. I finally was connected to the nearest Apple store near me which is a ferry ride away as I live remotely. First thing the person says is can you tell me what the issue is with your iPhone??!! After explaining that I have been on the phone for over an hour discussing my iMac not my ijunk, they tell me because I bought it on line the Apple store will not be able to do the return! So I called Apple care again and spoke to new person and explained my situation. They refer me to take it in to an Apple retailer, made me an appointment for next morning with an apple'genius'...code for MORON in actuality.  I explained to them that I live remotely and will not be happy if I take a ferry in just to walk in and have some pimple faced 15 year old stare at me like a deer in headlights. Oh no sir I assure you that will not happen, you're all set. So next morning I pack up the piece of junk and ferry in to my appointment with apple moron. Appointment is at 11:20, I arrived at 11:22, Apple moron shows up at 11:40, was sitting in back jerking or updating his FB status, who knows. Then I get the confused look as to why I'm there. Then explains that because I bought it on line, he can't do the return! Just as I knew it would go down, it did! Called Apple care from my car, after 1 hour of speaking to someone who was actually competent, explained that I bought it online, and was told by Apple store that I was not able to return it. The Apple care person assured me that was not true, put me on hold, called the nearest Apple store to me that was 15 minutes away and set up my return. She gave me the name of the employee to ask for when I got there. I walked in, asked for person in charge of my return, was told she was not there and had left that morning....even though Apple spoke to them 15 minutes ago!!! Why lie about it? Then was told but maybe I can help you, what seems to be the issue? After 45 minutes of explaining my horrible experience I finally got my 8K back! I am officially done with this garbage company.

On Thursday July 8, 2021 I was working outside most of the day with both phones in my pocket. Raleigh, NC was experiencing heavy rains due to a tropical storm. On Friday night, 7/9/21, the display on the iPhone 12 went out. Went online and made an appointment at an Apple store for 7/10/21.  The agent determined that it was water damage and offered the following solutions: 1) pay $449 for a repair/replacement. 2) buy a new phone starting at $399 and up based on various models. 3) pay $449 for a replacement iPhone 12 and then add 2 year warranty for $199 with a $99 deductible. However, even though I would be getting a new iPhone 12, the warranty would be retroactive to the original date of October 2020.  If I spent $449 for a new iPhone and compared extended warranty to no extended warranty it would be like this if I had another incident with water damage: Warranty: 15 months coverage (now thru Oct 2022) $199 + $99 deductible = $298 No warranty: $449 for replacement iPhone  My argument was that the iPhone 12 has a higher water resistance rating than does the iPhone 8. In addition, the water resistance decreases over time. The iPhone 8 is several years old and the iPhone 12 is less than a year old. Yet, both phones were exposed to the rain storm while in my pocket. The iPhone 8 is still working and the iPhone 12 is not.  The Apple agent stated that Apple does not get into the reasons or circumstances of how the water damage occurred, only that there is water damage and therefore it is not covered under their warranty. My counter that it appears that there was a manufacturing defect since the higher rated iPhone 12 was not as water resistant as the much older iPhone 8 was met with Apple policy of water damage = no warranty and no chance of manufacturing defect ever.",US

Are these bugs designed to spy on us? I really don't get it. Ever since Steve Jobs died, it seems that Apple is run by greedy adult children who no longer innovate, but infiltrate. It took a bit getting used to iOS Big Sur, (being a fan of the older 80s & 90s software & even iOS Catalina) but I started to get along with it. The software was fine. Now, suddenly without me doing anything to introduce malware to my computer, I think Apple did so purposefully (since it is all digital and accessible by WiFi) just so they could spy to see what else they can force-sell to me. It is sickening. My computer will not react normally anymore. It has become slower than a turtle, and I swear I did not download anything malicious. I even turn off the WiFi whenever I am not on. Sometimes, the darn WiFi will turn itself back on right in front of my eyes. I am not kidding, nor have I lost my marbles. I am a straight shooter & clear-headed. I used to fix vector scopes and beta max and VCR players for fun, so I am mechanically inclined and know those bells and whistles. I also keep up to date with the latest workings of IT.

Within a couple of weeks she dropped it from a low height (60-80cm above the floor) and despite being in an expensive apple protection case it developed a hairline crack.  I called up and arranged the return under Applecare+, the box was received and it was sent off to apple for repair.  So far, so normal... A couple of days later I received an email back saying that it was being sent back to me unrepaired and that it was not eligible for applecare+ repair.  I called up and no one at apple really seemed to know what was going on as it's a different company that deals with repairs.  I was told that the iPod might have have been deemed beyond economic repair.  The next day the iPod arrived back to me, with the same hairline crack to the screen.  I called up apple again and asked why it had not been repaired under applecare+ - again, total confusion, much waiting on the line and generally no real idea.  All that happened was I was told a new box would be sent and I would have to go through the same process once again, this time with a contact at apple I could call if the same nonsense happened again. Ridiculous waste of time.  Once upon a time you would accept apple's premium prices because of the quality of the service and aftercare.  This does not appear to be the case.  I would estimate I've spent about 3-4 hours trying to resolve what should have been a straightforward repair thus far thanks to failure in apple''s processes & systems.  Not acceptable.  At no point did anyone at apple offer a goodwill gesture / compensation for the hassle and the time I've had to waste on this matter. I had been considering upgrading my MBP to a M2 chip MBP later in 2021 when they are released.  On the basis of my experience dealing with apple support I will be reconsidering that decision. EDIT Having been given cast-iron assurances that the first return of the item without being repaired under applecare+ was a mistake I have just received notification that they are sending back the iPod again to me, once again unprepared.  I have *literally* spent 4 hours on calls to apple support who just seem as bewildered as me as to what's going on.  I'm currently 35 minutes into a call I'm being asked once again to prove that the iPod was working and only had a hairline crack...  They've received the device twice now. TOTAL. UTTER. SHAMBLES.

I followed up again only to find my complaint had not been recorded and followed up again. One technician said that it was a software issue and that you had to keep uploading until it recognised the document. It took one person 20 go's and on the 21st go it recognised the same receipt document to unlock the device. The fact that Apple won't recognise that they use faulty software as an IT company is ridiculous, wasting customers time trying to get their devices to work. I now have an ipad that my father bought for my mother for ¬£409.00 that he can't use and only got two months use out of. Having been sent in circles, every other matter of resolving her affairs have long been resolved yet we have got no where with this one. We've provided receipts, bank statements and all the evidence they've asked for and they stlll won't recognise my father as the rightful owner using the excuse of not wanting to compromise the privacy of my mother. How is compromising privacy if we want the device reset. We've offered a copy of the death certificate which they've declined. So we're sitting with a dead ipad unable to use it, apple won't respond to complaints or anything. Gone are the days where you pay a lot more than Android for 'customer service'. All I can advise is to stay clear of this company. Go with Android, never any problems.",GB

I went and cued for my appointment to be told the model was too old for the repair.  I wasted over 3 hours travelling and waiting at the height of a pandemic.  I raised a compliant and emailed the store directly.  No response. Yesterday, whilst out my 4 months old lightning mini-jack adaptor stopped working.  Although I could show it was not working and had the receipt, my only option was to buy a new one as someone from the genius bar needed to confirm it was not working.   It has taken 2 hours today to go round with the only option of booking over the phone a genius bar appointment to prove the adaptor is not working. Making a complaint is all but impossible. Shocking after care, with a view that their consumers time is completely expendable - i was shunted around 3 different people - none of whom seem equipped to deal with the issues adequately.",GB

1503,www.apple.com,2021-06-01T10:08:43.000Z,1,Apple fails to match the level of customer support with the beauty of their products,"Sexy products, but as many other electronic goods nowadays, they are programmed to fail, as soon as the warranty expires. The difference in this case is, Apple products and maintenance parts are extremely expensive, so the customer support should be flawless, to say the least. My first and hopefully last experience with Apple Service was an awful one. First off, when you want to approach them for any human interaction, you can only book a ‚Äúcall back‚Äù on their website, which, btw, is coming on the language settings defined by the browser you are booking this service from. I happened to be temporarily in Germany, so the language was not my native one, anyway, this is not the worst thing yet. As a former happy customer of an iMac 27‚Äù, iPad and lately a Macbook Pro 15‚Äù, I used to believe Apple service would have been one of the best, in any case in line with the nicely refined products they are producing. Nothing could prove to be more wrong than this assumption. Apple is clearly enjoying a position of monopoly by keeping pushing nice looking hardware on a thirsty market, neglecting the long-term consequences of a bad customer care. Now, to the point in case: my Macbook Pro is not even 3.5yrs old and became unusable because of well-known and in internet forums documented hardware defects. I start experiencing problems already a couple of years ago, with the built-in camera out of order. I could still survive without it, as the warranty expired already, although I felt a laptop of this price range should have a longer longevity of the camera.  Then the problem with repeated keys on the keyboard appeared. I am a programmer, so you can imagine how this is hitting on my nerves (and professional efficiency in the end) when with the time this becomes a frequent failure.  The last drop came few weeks ago, when the so-called ‚Äúflexgate‚Äù issue started affecting my laptop as well. Display goes off as soon as the lid is opens over a certain tilting angle (about 40¬∞, below that angle I really challenge everyone to use it for a normal job). Obviously, I could not keep using it and I brought it to the next service point. Although the defect is identical to the one recognized as covered under the Service-Program on the 13‚Äù model, the authorized service point rejected to cover all 3 defects, presenting a huge estimate for the repair. The first frustration came, as the Apple phone support suggested me to go to the next service point on the wrong opening times. I had to drive there twice during the same day.  Secondly, they did not speak about costs which might have been incurred even in case the parts were not replaced. As I said, I was in a different country and apart from the language barrier, I was assuming, diagnosing a fault was not charged to the customer, as it happens in the country where I bought the item. Instead, 2 weeks after the service point presented me an invoice through email, no repair done, no goodwill exceptions approved. Not even a phone call is an Apple customer worth. The service point was hiding behind the fact that they had to check with Apple, if the defects were to be covered or not under any service program and could not know in advance about the decision. Now, obviously I was not happy with that outcome and called the Apple support again. The personnel are not showing any empathy to the customer, regardless whether I bought merely an iPhone plastic cover or if I had been a loyal customer of expensive hardware during several years in the past. They keep repeating that if any goodwill exception, this must be coming from the local service-point, which as you can imagine, in turn bounces back the responsibility onto the manufacturer.  At the same time, Apple does not do anything to push the service point in doing so. What a disaster of a worldwide enterprise who should really take seriously the advice or changing things for the better!  The impression is really, that Apple claims to operate on the field through a well-established network of authorized resellers and service points, but in fact they are totally disconnected and not working together, at least when it comes to meet the customer‚Äôs needs. I have been working in a customer support role for a high-end product for 15 years and the first thing you learn, is that customer is king, especially, when he has invested a consistent amount of money into the brand and when an evident failure is not caused by customer abuse but rather linked to a product demonstrated weakness. Apparently Apple is not yet realizing that basic rule or is showing arrogance enough vs. customer retention and advocacy based on the high profit they are earning through pure marketing investments.",DE

My family had iPhones a few years back and one of them needed a replacement screen. The Apple Store wanted over $1000 and tried to get us to buy the latest model, so we said no. We took it to a local repair shop who did the job in under $300 but they needed to replace the button (this was a long time ago) on the bottom of the screen. He replaced the button but then the phone stopped working. He then discovered that Apple designed the phone to ""resist"" non-Apple store repairs on the devices.

1523,www.apple.com,2021-05-25T03:59:29.000Z,1,Worst customer service I have ever experienced.,"I have been a loyal Apple customer since 2005, having purchased two iMacs, a Mac mini, an iPod, two Apple TVs, half a dozen iPhones, 8 iPads, and thousands of dollars in apps, music, and tv shows from the App Store and iTunes Store. Last week I purchased multiple complete sets of classic Warner Bros cartoons.  I also purchased 15 individual cartoons from the Bugs Bunny 80th Anniversary Collection.  The entire collection sells for $39.99, or you can purchase them individually for $2.99 each.  Many of these cartoons were repeats of ones that I had already purchased from previous sets, which is why I didn‚Äôt buy the complete set of this item to begin with.  Each time I bought an individual cartoon the price to complete the entire set went down by the amount I paid for the individual cartoon, in this case $2.99.  So after buying the first individual cartoon I could complete the set by paying $37, and after the second cartoon by paying $34.01 etc.   I ended up purchasing 15 individual cartoons for a total of $44.85, which is more than the cost of buying the whole set.  At that point I assumed the cost to complete the set would be 0, since I had paid more than the original $39.99 price for the entire set.  To my surprise that wasn‚Äôt the case.  The price to complete the set reverted back to $39.99.  I contacted Apple multiple times regarding this, twice by chat and twice by phone.  I explained to them what happened.  They have a record to verify what I told them.  I respectfully asked if the could complete my set since I had paid more than the asking price, or if they couldn‚Äôt do that then could they please refund the money I paid for the individual cartoons and then I would purchase the entire set for $39.99.  Both of my requests were refused.  I even had two supervisors get involved, the last one by the name of Janina.  It didn‚Äôt help.   This is not a lot of money.  That isn‚Äôt the point.  What is disappointing is that I no longer feel I can trust Apple.  To treat a long-standing previously loyal customer in this way, by refusing a simple reasonable request, tells me everything I need to know about this company and it‚Äôs culture.  It‚Äôs sad really, because when I first started buying Apple products I raved to my friends about how great their customer service was.  At that time it was the gold standard in my opinion.

After losing $75 when my iTunes balance disappeared into thin air and the only way to get it back was to find the gift cards which I redeemed, (which I couldn't find) I started to do some research. Since 2008, thousands and thousands of Apple users have had their iTunes or App Store balances just vanish. It's 2021, and Apple has not done anything about it. It's understandable, though, because they make $millions in pure profit from those balances. The most common scenario is after an iOs update, the user's balance just goes to zero. It's been happening for 13 years and Apple knows about it. The only way to get your money back is to prove to Apple that your balance wasn't $0.00 before the iOs update. This requires hours waiting on hold, escalating to senior CSR's and having the proof, for instance- the physical gift cards you redemmed. A process that can take hours or days. Some users that have the time and energy to bear that process are able to get their balance restored, but what about everyone else? Apple simply absorbs the profit.

My Dad died earlier this year and he left behind an iPhone 11, to which my mother gave to me. I tried to get Apple to help me deactivate the phone  and clear it for a new user because it was disabled and such a simple thing turned out to be a long journey up a Garden part. I was subjected to being on the phone for hours, downloading various things and having apple staff connecting remotely trying to resolve the issue. I was then advised to get the IMEI number and proof of purchase from the store where the phone was bought. I travelled to the store, they couldn‚Äôt give me proof of purchase in store and advised I request a copy from head office. I did all of this uploaded all the documentation and received an email saying the info was insufficient. I spoke to a million different people at Apple until I demanded to be passed to a senior staff member. This senior manager then told me to get the serial number from the box, I explained my dad is dead and he bought the phone last year there is no box. I called o2 back and the lady who was assisting said  in her 9 years of working for o2 bereavement she has never been asked for a serial a number only the IMEI and other basics. To wrap this whole long saga up after numerous calls and speaking to the incompetent staff at apple I was finally put through to the BS  ‚ÄòLegacy team‚Äô who then said I need to apply for probate blah blah blah. It is so frustrating that my dad who died suddenly paid all that money for a phone my mum gave it to me and now I can‚Äôt use it because Apple want your blood and DNA. I will never ever buy another Apple phone as long as I live and take this from someone who has had Apple phones for years. BS greedy company with no compassion and consideration, they pretend to put customers at the core of their service but they are nothing more than greedy leeches  who are over saturating the market with their greed.

I really hope that others will have more luck or perhaps think twice about purchasing Apple products especially with the lack of empathy and understanding from Apple support team.  I have a visually impaired daughter who has been fighting for her sight since she was born, she is now 10 years old and has used an iPad as a key tool in her everyday life since she was a baby and unfortunately can't see more than 30cm in front of her today. We purchased the first iPad for our daughter when she was only 4 months old as doctors advised us that visual inputs were key to developing her sight and stimulating parts of her brain responsible for vision. She has learnt to use an iPad as a tool in her everyday life. It is used for everything from taking photo's of her homework to zoom in on content to relaxing and watching TV or socializing with friends. Recently her iPad Pro stopped working so we decided to purchase a new iPad Pro directly from the Apple online Store. Unfortunately the delivery time on the Apple store was over 2 months. This means that our daughter doesn't have a key tool she uses in her everyday life to assist her with basic tasks like school work or zooming in on items to see them. In an attempt to assist her I contacted Apple support in the hopes that Apple might be able to help, however according to Apple in Denmark they couldn't do anything. I asked if they would be able to speed up the delivery date, or perhaps provide a temporary solution but without even taking the time to research if this was possible I got a direct answer that this was not possible and not something Apple does. I have to admit I am shocked at the response from Apple Support and how they handled the situation. A hugely profitable company was not able to support a 10 year old girl with a solution for something so life changing. Especially as I was able to show Apple a purchase confirmation you would have thought they would be able to assist but that is obviously not the case. I will let you make your own judgements but I have to say I am hugely disappointed and it is quite obvious to me that inclusion is not a priority within Apple.",DK

But as my demands for certain things grew (had grown more than I had realized) the first Mac I got completely changed my standards. I had even disliked Apple before; thinking they just sold an expensive brand/image with the ""same"" hardware. But what I love most about my Mac is the OS; My impression is that Windows computers are built around the _computer_ whereas Macs are built around the human. It is much more fluent to use, and is far more stable than all PCs I have ever had (a couple of them high-end). Also; (I have the old kind of Macbook Air still) it has a build quality I have never encountered in any PC, and (actually the number 1 thing I look for in computers) it is completely silent 95% of the time, which is worth a lot to me.

Below is the review of Google Maps Apple refused to post on the App Store, after they had previously posted it for months without an addition I made. When you submit a review it is not immediately posted. I have recently learned that it goes to the developer, who has an option to reply or ‚Äúreport a concern‚Äù. Google had previously deleted SIX out of SEVEN related Google reviews at around the same time that were TRUTHFUL, FACTUAL, HONEST REVIEWS of appalling, abusive, corrupt treatment I had suffered over a long period of time at the hands of English solicitors, police and companies. Yet they ask you to help others by writing your honest account of your experiences with the company or at the location. Google did this to hide the shocking pattern of abuse and horrific treatment that I had suffered from these English police and firms. It deleted so many reviews without explanation, warning or notifying me or giving me a way to contact them to question, challenge or appeal its extreme and damaging actions and even when I used my Google Account feedback to write to them, they never bothered to reply. This is the Chinese Communist style censorship ability introduced by the advent of the internet and related tech firms, many of whom were seed funded by the CIA, NSA and DARPA.  My first App Store review of Google Maps was a one star review but said nothing about their funding sources. Some weeks later I added the removal of my six reviews and Apple allowed that, although Google may have reported it. It was when I added that Google was seed funded by the CIA, the previous edit disappeared (which seems to happen when you edit), but my update failed to materialise. So they removed what they had previously passed, without posting my update. Why did Apple not leave the former edit in place if they didn‚Äôt want my update? I now realise that Google developers reported my update, so they removed six of my reviews on their own website, then had Apple remove my review which spoke of their deletions. Google, which is a product of the US military‚Äôs DARPA, is a very sinister company.   I tried reposting and then re-edited my post to remove the CIA reference, I posted and waited a few days, then I became frustrated and I used the review writing facility to speak to both Google developers and Apple staff. I said my updated review was blocked, my OK‚Äôd review removed, that attempts to repost, even repost without the update hadn‚Äôt been accepted. I said I would make a complaint. Strangely, the next day the post I had been waiting to see posted suddenly appeared, but the next day Apple responded to my complaint by removing that which they had decided to allow, never to post it again, even edited, despite many attempts.  I have been prevented from giving any review of my experience of Google Maps app at all, which as an iPhone user of the app I am supposed to have the right to do, like anyone else. And this is with no communication from Apple or Google, who are deliberately frustrating me and adding to abuse I have been suffering for long. Apple tell the app devs they won‚Äôt tell the reviewers the devs reported them, but I know Google did take advantage of my frustration and that Apple is colluding with Google against one of their own customers to do to me what notorious censors Google have already done to me many times. My review of Google Maps suppressed by Apple: ‚ÄúWhat I noticed while using the app was that when I logged out and used it, I started getting ads from a taxi operator. This tells me my personalised log-in data coupled with my location data over time is very valuable to Google, like gold. So they don‚Äôt bother with the ads when you‚Äôre logged in. But when I logged out, they felt they had to monetise me in some other way. The personal and location data compromise with Google is far too much for me to use this app long term. They really prefer you to be logged in when you use the app, but it‚Äôs not necessary. I also found they encouraged (or one could say ‚Äútricked‚Äù) me to set location to ‚ÄúAlways On‚Äù, rather than ‚ÄúWhile Using the App‚Äù using the reason that I would receive up to the minute traffic information. But the traffic info was perfectly OK even when location was only on ‚ÄúWhile Using the App‚Äù, so I think it is highly questionable of Google to encourage us to have location always on.  No way is this app as ‚Äúfree‚Äù as it appears.""",GB

I know this won't stop most people from buying their products,  I'm just really really upset. I had a macbook that had stopped working. In February 2020 I brought it in with my parents. We were thinking of replacing it with a new computer, but we wanted to get it looked at first. The man at the genuis bar looked at our computer and recomended that we not buy a new computer, because our version was not sold anymore and was a really great model. He instead recomended we refurbish it. My parents agreed and we paid $1,200 to replace the keyboard, screen and battery that had water damage and we were told we had a warranty.  I returned a few weeks later to pick it up. Everything looked good, it was working fine. Then I took it home and within 2 weeks it stopped working. COVID happened and the store was moved so it took us like 4 months to come back. I made an appointment and came in. The genius man assured us we still had a warranty, that they will keep it and call us when they know the problem.  A few days a very rude lady called me to tell me there was no point fixing the computer because there was water damage all over the battery.  I swear on everything, I never EVER spilled anything on it after it was fixed. I try to tell this women and she cuts me off saying sorry but because since it waswater damage our waranty won't work plus our warranty was expired after 3 months.

Worth saying I have been a user and advocate for apple for 36 years since my LC at the age of 7 to today. This is the second time my iPhone XR's screen has failed.  The first occurrence was a massive inconvenience, having to go into store and wait for over a week or two for a repair. On first occurrence its moderately acceptable for a consumer to manage issues. On the second occurrence this time its not acceptable for a consumer to be inconvenienced considering the original price of the product.  At it is the two support options don't work for me: 1. In store repair - I have a disability, I am at greater risk during this pandemic, I cannot go into store because I don't have transport, I will also not conduct travel during the pandemic. Lastly and importantly I will likely be without the phone for personal and mostly business reasons. My business is struggling in the pandemic as it is. I cannot afford to be uncontactable for realistically a week 2. Mail in - Again importantly I will likely be without the phone for personal and mostly business reasons. My business is struggling in the pandemic as it is. I cannot afford to be uncontactable for realistically a week. I believe apple need to supply a solution to help people in this period. That means using the apple care plus track and supply a stop gap phone during repair. I have said that I would pay for this stop gap phone but that is not an option and there are NO other options than 1 or 2. That cannot be possible in a trillion$ market cap organisation? There must be pathways where apple TRULY support their customers and not just say so. That means not putting them at an extremely convenience for repeat faults. This screen fault has already consumed about 2 weeks the first time and now 1 day. The guys at the highest customer support tier claim there is nothing I can do, but there should be. Come on Apple we stand by you, stand by us with some method that works and offer paths to explore The most I was given was a feedback link with a character limit too small to explain my disappointment at apple.

I was looking to buy a new I pad or Laptop. My mom had just bought a new I phone 12. The first appointment was scheduled at 5, this one was for me to talk with a sells rep and get help to determine what product was the best for me. The second appointment was at 515. This was for my mother and my daughter. They needed help transferring the data from my moms old phone to her new one, erasing the phone, transferring the data from my daughters phone to her old one and getting her Apple Watch paired to the phone. When we walked in at 5 and told them about our appointments, they started off by telling us that we couldn't have two appointments. That every one gets one 15 min session. We tried to explain that we were there for two different things but they didn't care. After having to argue with them for 10 mins, they finally told my mother and daughter to go wait outside in the cold until their appointment. (Which was in 5 mins). I was then directed to my sells person. He asked me what I needed a new I pad or Laptop for. I explained the things I use the products for and started asking him questions about the differences between the I pad Air vs the Pro vs the different laptops. I was asking about the processors, the memory and such. The sales person told me they are all the same, when your just answering E-mail. He made me feel like a complete idiot and after asking a couple of question in less than 10 mins, He told me I would be better off just ordering something on line from home.

However, there is no excuse for a completely failed product after only 2 years of extremely light usage. I purchased a 13"" MacBook Pro which I rarely ever used, but not Apple support claims it needs a $600 new logic board for it to function. INEXCUSABLE. I wish I could verify the amount of hours this laptop has operated before dying. There are laptops in the $100 range that outperform this product. I'm angry not simply because this product has failed, but because Apple has refused to stand by their product. I understand length of warranties and whatnot, but there is absolutely no credible reason for a logic board to fail in such a short amount of time other than Apple sold me a defective product, or at the very least a product with very poor quality.",US

I have a large number of music files on a Windows PC which I wished to transfer to my Ipad, to have them physically present on the Ipad, not in the Cloud.  With an Android tablet it is an easy task, just connect the tablet and copy the folder with the music over. Not so easy with IOS.  I called the customer support line and had difficulty making the operator understand, she did not know how to do it.  So I asked for another operator, who similarly did not understand the question, nor was able to answer my query.   I finally managed to talk with someone else.  He eventually understood my request, but basically he did not know how to help me.  I I had been on the phone for 45 minutes, and three operators were unable to tell me how to make hard copies of music files held on a PC, to my Ipad. I finished the call and then went on to an Apple support page, where I found the answer, which is simply to connect the Ipad to the PC and select ‚Äòshare files‚Äô in Itunes.  It was so easy.  I copied my files to VLC and am now happy that I also have my files on my Ipad. However, I now have little confidence in Apple support, if they are unable to answer such a simple question.  Surely there must be other PC owners who have wanted to transfer files to an Ipad? May I add, that the three advisers, although not compentent were very polite.",GB

Bad customer service.,"As an owner of 7 Apple products, I am appalled at the customer service I have received today. It has made me rethink about Apple being my go-to company for technology products. It is the case in my household that an Apple purchase is often made without a second thought ‚Äì a new laptop? MacBook it is. Looking to buy a smartwatch? Apple Watch will do the job. Need headphones? AirPods are the best investment. Need computer peripherals? Apple Magic Keyboard and Mouse cannot be beaten.  Due to this decision-making process, I am upset today and challenging my thoughts; despite having enjoyed excellent customer support throughout the previous many years, it has left a bitter taste today. Having spent thousands of pounds on Apple products, my request today was for a value much smaller: I had forgotten to redeem the Apple Fitness+ 3 month free subscription when I bought my Apple watch. This can be put down to the COVID-19 pandemic and fitness not being a priority over the period. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay‚Äù, I thought, as the customer support will be able to help me, just as they always have. I was wrong. Having politely asked for an exception to the rule and have the offer on my account activated; I was rudely told that this is not possible. For a ¬£30 subscription, Apple has lost a client whose value is much higher to the company. It can be seen on my account that I am a loyal customer of Apple.  I‚Äôm not one to leave negative reviews for companies and try to see things from their perspective. I am also not disappointed about the loss of the ¬£30 subscription ‚Äì I‚Äôm disappointed that I had embedded trust into a company and felt like my trust was misplaced ‚Äì I have been let down. I feel betrayed for investing in Apple products only to be rejected without much explanation or offers provided. In contrast, other telecommunication companies offer discounts by the least.  Having portrayed my disappointment to the Apple advisor on the phone support, he dismissed my views without much thought. After telling him that I will be thinking twice before buying Apple products, he simply said ‚Äúwell, at least you know for the future how offer redemption works‚Äù.  I‚Äôm not sure I have quite grasped that yet, but I have a very clear idea of how Apple operates as a company.

After a few days I received a phone back was not my old one but apparently not a ‚Äònew one‚Äô or an ‚Äòused one‚Äô.  The reason was that my phone was stuck on the Apple logo and would not be removed.  I think it‚Äôs wrong as I have had androids phones and know people who have had them and they have had no trouble with regards to memory and batteries. For what the product costs Apple needs to improve the quality. Also, the storage says about on the device but there‚Äôs no way to remove it. Also, you should not have to pay for more memory when you buy a smartphone that costs a few hundred pounds. I expect it better than other phones.  I contacted the apple customer service again as this new phone keeps playing up since the download and told me to reset the phone and I asked whether it would delete anything and she said no but once came back on it appeared to have deleted. Another, thing also is iCloud backup as you cannot complete it without purchasing more storage as I‚Äôve tried many times to backup but won‚Äôt allow me.  I have 11.7 GB of 64GB used and yet it still appears to say the phone storage is full on my emails and settings and when I try to do backup.  I am seriously considering buying another phone because I‚Äôve had many iPhones and they are poor quality. I think it‚Äôs wrong a company can charge so much for a phone or product that battery goes quick and they expect you to pay for more memory and get fixed at their centre so you have to pay more money. Not everyone can afford to do so.",GB
1668,www.apple.com,2021-04-03T02:42:07.000Z,2,"Poor customer service, and uninformed management.","I recently took my iphone and iMac into the Apple store for long standing issues. I'll start with my iphone, while working on my phone with a store employee and getting very involved in what we were doing a store supervisor told the person who was working with me that they had to break away from me and help someone else and a new person was going to take their place and we had to almost start all over again. I ask why that took place and I was told that Apple doesn't want employees working with one person too long so they keep moving employees around. This to me is a major inconvenience to the customer, and this action demonstrates EXTREMELY  POOR customer service. We the customers deserve far better treatment than to be treaded off like an old broken piece of equipment. This practice is disturbing  and uncalled for and I would like to see this procedure changed. Remember we customers are your life's blood and your bottom line. I would love feed back...  Now my iMac, like my phone I have had a issue with my Mac for over a year, that seems to be unfixable. And after taking my Mac into the store, I was told that only software engineers could fix the issue on my Mac. Again while working on my Mac a supervisor told the employee to hurry and get done and move on. The issue was not solved and I was told that they would have someone call me to arrange to ship my Mac to a repair center, finally this morning I became tired of waiting and I called to find out what was taking so long. ""BUT"" while trying to talk to a support person my new phone started acting up and no one on the other end could hear me. I took my phone to the store and once again after working on my phone for a while the supervisor pulled the employee (who was doing a great job) and moved her and put someone new in her place and I had to explain to the new person what the issue was and what was going on, now I'm getting upset, and after working on my phone leaving me to complete the setup, I was told to once again call support about my Mac. They did say someone would call me this evening. When that person called I was told I couldn't mail my Mac to the repair center it had to be the store personal, so now I'm going bace to the store tomorrow with my Mac in hand and see what happens. Either fix my Mac or replace it... (And stop moving employees who are working with customers)...",US

A few weeks ago I had a bad accident involving my phone resulting in major cracks on the front and back of the phone. I made a Genius Bar appointment at my local Apple store to see if there was any way of repairing the phone. The employee helping me told me that the phone could not be repaired, but that I could get some trade-in value for $50. I was surprised by this and asked the employee if he could double-check with a manager just to make sure I could get a trade-in value. He confirmed and told me I had 14 days to bring the phone back to the store to receive the trade-in value (I would have done the trade-in same-day, but I needed to do backup on my newly purchased phone).  Yesterday, I returned to the same Apple store to bring my phone in. I told the employee about my previous conversation with the other employee, and he informed me that my phone would NOT qualify for trade-in. Disappointed, I asked him if he could double-check with someone. He came back and confirmed that I would not be able to get any trade-in value for my old phone.  Now, $50 really isn't a big deal. I wasn't expected to get any trade-in value in the first place. But, I drove all the way to my nearest Apple store during a pandemic and even requested time off from work to accommodate my appointment with an Apple specialist. If the phone wasn't worth anything, I wouldn't have bothered coming in. This experience didn't make me feel valued as a customer and it makes me question the way Apple employees are being trained. Why would I have received two VERY different answers about my phone's trade-in value? I'm not sure. I think this is a great opportunity for Apple to better train their employees.",US

I get that they are trying to do the best during the pandemic but I have a few issues with people telling me what I can and cannot have or telling me 1 person per household when clearly they can see the person that your with has medical issues like a cane and clearly cant walk very well... So here is my issue, I get that shops have a guideline to follow but telling someone that they cant go in to assist their mother (who clearly has medical problems) immediately and after me telling them ""so your basically saying I can't assist someone who clearly cant walk properly...and what if she falls who is going to be the one to help her up? you guys cant touch her soooo..."" which made them look childish for stopping me in the first place.... so after them making the -acception- I was then forced to change my mask to a medical grade mask that I cannot breath in due to my own medical problems (I have asthma as well as low deep breathing due to anxiety causing thick masks to make me faint... Kinda like shoving your face into a pillow and trying to breath... I have difficulty breathing as it is) so after me stunned and looking at them for a good 5 seconds and asking them again what they had said to me ""we have to comply to store guidelines that were given to make sure everyone is wearing a medical grade mask"" still dumb founded because now I am being told that my mask that helps me breath, that I have worn even before this pandemic and my doctor telling me avoid medical grade (since the last time I wore one was when I was 5 and I ended up fainting in the doctors office because I couldn't breath -complained about them then-) so now I kind of had an issue. So in order for me to be in the APPLE STORE I have to wear a mask that a) feels like a pillow on my face b) causes me to faint & c) gets to hot in them which caused me to cough and freak quite a few people. So now being told I couldn't help my mother who cant walk and not able to wear my mask because it wasnt medical grade... OKAY so my mask is a garter mask with ear peices on it. Its a light fabric for those who run, bike or do alot of activities. I have 3 of them and never had any issues of going into stores until now. Which ticks me off. I do get that they are trying their best, but dont dictate which masks is the best. Mine covers literally the lower half of my head, light fabric and has unique weaving so my own spit cant even escape and doesnt over heat unlike the 3 layered medical grade. But what really gets me is that this shop isn't outside, it was in a mall... There was a total of 10 people waiting and the store was full... I dont take my mask off until I get back into my car. but of course, I had no choice in order to assist my crippled mother I had to risk not only my health (if anyone is a carrier) or someone elses (if I was a carrier) which is reckless to say the least and defeats the purpose of trying to keep yourselves safe. That was a poor decision forcing someone to change their masks because of APPLES guidelines for their stores. I could see if it was someone who WASN'T wearing a mask but for someone who was wearing a covering over their face and thats beyond ridiculous. So after exposing the bottom half of my face and putting on the damn mask we get in and I was already getting dizzy and trying to steady my breathing which was getting harder to breath in. The poor guy was watching me as he was doing a diagnostic on my mothers cell phone and asked if I was going to be okay... and I answered ""apple needs to change that policy of these masks. I am trying to keep myself coherent yet everything is going black"" the guy also agreed that the policy on dictating on which mask is the best and forcing people to change their masks in public does defeat the purpose of wearing a mask in the first place... after a good 10 mins I booked it out of the store and immediately switched back to my mask where I could breath properly. Its a good thing I dont own an apple product (yet) and if anyone is planning on going to the stores, if you have medical issues preventing you from wearing the medical grades you might as well wait till the pandemic is over, send it through mail or if they change the guidelines about masks. At this point its not worth your health and having to risk yourself on having to change your masks specially if you have conditions (low immune disorders, asthma...etc). Sorry for typing so much, but it really does grind my gears about being told what mask I can wear in a store. Im at least wearing a covering that is comfortable for me... If I do end up in the hospital because of this stupid move on which masks I can ONLY wear in the store and forcing me to change it right there I put the blame on APPLE not the people who are force to follow APPLE's guidelines. Putting me and possible others at risk is negligent because of what type of mask you wear when you go in the store.",CA

Having chosen to repair my iPad through Apple‚Äôs online service, I waited ca 10 days to receive the packaging in which to send away my device. I believe a good deal of this delay was caused by the chosen carrier (UPS) but since my contract is with Apple, and they didn‚Äôt provide any alternative options, I am holding them indirectly responsible for this delay.  I am also holding them responsible for sending the wrong packaging, that for an Apple Watch, and not an iPad, which was of course not fit for purpose. Despite my attempts to shorten the process from here on out by using the device‚Äôs original packaging plus the delivery labels I had received, I was advised that I had to restart the process (presumably to reset the clock on the repair) and waited an additional 3 days for the correct packaging to arrive. I packed away my iPad, sent off via courier the same day. I was advised that my device had been received the following day, and actually received a replacement refurbished product the the day after that, ie today. It seemed things were starting to look up....that is until it became clear that the replacement device, which initially powered up, is unable to hold it‚Äôs charge. Another 30 minutes on the phone to Apple‚Äôs support centre (having wasted 10 minutes with one employee who took various details and then transferred me to another department with no intro, causing me to have to repeat the security process) and the best they can do is to offer to ‚Äòpay for another repair/replacement on their own account‚Äô - how generous! I‚Äôve now completely lost faith in the whole process, and don‚Äôt see why I should have to waste even more of my time on this, time which is precious given I have a 7 day old baby at home, and a disgruntled 5 year old who has been without her iPad for approaching a month....first world problems I know, but within the context of having paid so much for this device and many others over the years, this is a truly awful level of customer service in my opinion. Furthermore, my attempts to get them to rectify this have been met with a request for me to wait till Friday until the seemingly very competent customer service representative I most recently dealt with returns to the office.....is this really the way one of the biggest customers in the world wants to treat a loyal customer? I suppose time will tell.... Update: While very pleasant, the customer service representative who asked me to wait until today to ‚Äòsee what more apple could do‚Äô was ultimately able to offer me nothing more than a phone call to waste some more of my time. Confused and contradictory messaging about whether they would seek to repair or replace my device with another device which would or would not be brand new wasn‚Äôt especially helpful, especially as it rather missed the point that I lacked confidence in this process as it already yielded delays and my receiving a non-functioning replacement. Ultimately, it seems Apple are either unwilling or unable to do any more than follow the standard repair process, irrespective of the fact that I‚Äôve already had to go through an elongated version of this process once only to receive a faulty replacement device, and that now 23 days on from my originally requesting a repair, I am still without a functioning device or a timeframe on when I can expect to receive one. Well done Apple, truly terrible service all round. Second Update: After yet more wasted time, this time via the chat function, I am still no nearer to resolution. On the contrary, there is now yet another delay to my receiving the packaging from UPS!",GB

I wanted to go in person to one of the stores but all of them were closed.  I spent several hours with technical support over the phone but they were unable to fix anything, they indicated the phone was defective so they offered to send me a new phone by mail which would not work for me as I would need help to activate/ transfer everything into the new one and it would still leave me with Mac issues. I decided to keep putting up with problems until stores would be opened again.  Stores reopened, but I just had to keep waiting as I‚Äôm unable to wear a mask.  After our State Governor held a round table with best experts ever and decided to lift masks requirements, I finally made an appointment with Genius Bar. Today I made it to my appointment bringing a face shield just in case, to be in compliance but to my surprise, face shield is no longer sufficient for Apple even at this juncture when requirement has finally been lifted in light of overwhelming true science based evidence that masks not only DO NOT WORK, but they‚Äôre actually HARMFUL to healthy individuals, let alone the ones with medical conditions. I was told I had to wear a mask also under the shield or just leave the store.  I explained I was wearing a shield precisely as an alternative since I can not wear a mask but the masked man was utterly insensitive and determined to make me leave. I asked them if they were aware that the Governor had finally removed the masks mandates and he stated they only abide by their corporate policy. Then I contacted corporate office and spent 53 minutes on the phone speaking with Sr Advisor only to confirm that indeed, Apple Corporate, in utterly departure from science, have obliviously resolved to DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE WITH MEDICAL CONDITIONS.   I very much regret getting these items from these Nazis.  I‚Äôm now stuck with no service until I‚Äôm able to replace them both.  NO MORE APPLE FOR ME!!!",US

We called to get a replacement and they are saying they can not replace it until we mark our phone as lost.  We have tried and it says it won't complete the ""lost"" process until the phone connects to the internet, but the phone flew out on the freeway so there is no way for the phone to connect to the internet.  Now we have lost $1400 because they won't replace the phone.  This is crazy to me.  I just find apple care useless at this point.  I know it helps if they phone is damaged which is great but what happens if you don't have the phone at all.  I don't get it.

During checkout I was giving two choices for the order; mail devices to home by Tuesday, or Express Pickup @ local store (Apple North Star).  The item was listed as available today, so I chose Express Pickup. A logical person would assume express pickup would mean, the item would be available to the purchaser sometime today, since the order was placed at 12pm noon. So about 3:30 I head to the mall, assuming, the device would shortly be available. I stop by the Apple store with my purchase information and was greeted kindly by manager Andy. Andy stated processing usually takes a couple of hours. I educated Andy, the order was made at noon and it was 4pm at time of discussion, which is 2 x couple of hours. Andy called some corporate number and stated he was advised the order was showing still processing, but to wait on the pickup email and ask for him once I receive it and I would not have to wait in the entrance line again. Well, it's now the end of day two and the store closed already. I called Apple.com regarding my purchase,  and the young lady who answered the call asked what she could help with and I explained I was calling to check the status of my purchase. She advised me to hold on and the next thing I heard was the automated system asking me to enter the extension of the person I was trying to reach. I hung up and had to call back and spoke with a male customer service rep the second time, who stated they were reviewing my payment information and it should be cleared up in the morning. I inquired why would they they need to review my payment information and for what concerns? He stated, sometimes there could be slight errors that are reviewed and have to be cleared. I educated that I was in the local store the day before and if any information needed to be verified, then that would have been the best time to verify any concerns. The truth is, all of this has been a load of crock. These are operational issues and apple has demonstrated that after a year of closure, no one was intelligent enough to have a reopening plan in place. They have demonstrated a failure to timely process orders and provide standard customer service; which is the bare minimum below good customer service. We knew they lost the vision of the company when Steve Jobs died, but it appears they don't even have leadership capable of reestablishing a functional operation. Instead of fixing the problem, they chose to treat consumers as if we're all ignorant fools they can side track to cover their own failures.

In January I purchased the above to replace my 12 year old MacBook Pro which was still working perfectly well but I wanted to improve the sound and it was quite heavy and large. I go all the way back to the SE30's with Apple and I've bought 100's of their computers having run a print business most of my life. From the outset I have pioneered postscript and the Apple interface with the print industry and whilst always greedy for more speed they have usually met my expectations, particularly the FX. I have also often sung the praises of Apple technical support who over the years have excelled themselves. It therefore saddens me to report how disappointed I am in the Macbook Air M1 processor. I stress the M1 processor as both my children have Macbook Airs and are very happy. I'm retired now so my demands of a computer are much less. I gave my Macbook Pro to my grandson on receipt of the new  MacBook Air M1. My main interest is football & travel and I'm signed up to Sky, BT, Amazon etc to watch all the games particularly whilst traveling. I was therefore most disappointed to note Sky Go didn't work whilst it did on my  Macbook Pro! I also have a problem at my partners home where the speed of my Macbook Air is only 25% of that of my partners 7 year old Macbook Air again not an issue with my Macbook Pro. After numerous conversations with BT & Sky Go making no progress whatsoever, I and my partner made one last attempt last night. I was finally put through to senior technical support and thought at last. He said he had reviewed the history of my issues and without checking anything whatsoever claimed to have identified the issue, much to my relief, it was in fact my expectations of a new computer as in the first instance there are often issues interfacing with third party Apps etc. Well I was fuming and let him know. I finally requested the opportunity to complain at a higher level, he said it had got to as high as it can and the next step would be to complete a complaints procedure which he would forward following our conversation. I'm still waiting!!! Whilst my expectations of progress can at times exceed reality helped I would say by Apples copy writing, I did not expect to go backwards who ever is responsible! I'm not that heartless to request my old computer back from my grandson so I have to watch the game on my Iphone!!!!!

It had a green dot in any photos taken in bright lighting since it was sent to me.  I expected much MORE from iPhone and Apple.  Upon recently noticing an issue with my screen display (my phone doesn't have a cracked screen or hasn't been severely dropped), I decided to call for warranty replacement.  Since then, my opinion as a consumer of Apple has drastically changed.  They do every thing they can to avoid replacing the phone and make you do ""trial and error"" with no regards to how time consuming it is for the consumer, or how many phone screen covers you have to replace.  Then the worst was after I went in for the first ""repair"" when I really was asking for it to be ""replaced,"" and they had me wait 1.5 hours for the repair and then said the ""phone was fixed.""  After this the phone actually has MORE issues.  Including a serious issue of me not being able to hear the person speaking during inbound calls. I now have to take all my phone calls on speaker phone.  This is AFTER having the Apple Store give it back and say ""it was fixed"" and it not being ""replaced"" as I had asked.  The entire reason I was asking for replacement was to avoid these types of time consuming headaches.  APPLE has no respect for the consumer.   Today while calling to address that the phone was given back with MORE ISSUES than I brought it in with...I was hung up on by a supervisor after 30 MINUTES of TROUBLE SHOOTING because she didn't want to help me book and appointment and hung up on me when I asked her to hold for 1 minute as I own a business and a client was calling me on the business line.  She hung up an although had call back info, did not call back! So then I have to call Apple and start from the beginning.  I even explained all this to them.  I WAS HUNG UP ON AGAIN by Tia the ""supervisor,"" after doing about 40 MINUTES of phone support with her.  It seemed that she was making me go though UNECESSARY TROUBLESHOOTING when all I have been asking is simply to have my phone replaced through WARRANTY.  I  have experienced an issue with the phone that is eligible under the warranty for replacement and simply was asking for the phone to be REPLACED, not REPAIRED.  This is the THIRD time I had to call Apple support and the SECOND TIME I will be having to go back to the Apple Store in a week.

So much care & precaution were taken to deliver the replacement safely with an easy instruction to follow to return the above faulty product. Not All managers or customer service staff are identical when dealing with customers. But, a young lady called (Fulden) who was assigned to the return case, in my opinion she was the most professional person I‚Äôve ever had to deal with at Apple customer service.  I know, she was the highest points of contacts, but it‚Äôs a credit to Apple who‚Äôs trained and located a very valuable asset to their company. Very calm, highly skilled in dealing with distressed customers.  At Apple, more Fulden is needed to deal with customer issues. I don‚Äôt have her full name as I have only seen her name on the email & voice on the phone. I‚Äôm happy when customers are treated with a respect. Customers are part of the company to exist.

New phone freezes up and old phone is immediately deactivated. Spend hours online trying to see how to fix the freeze-try all the suggestions, nothing works 2/26/21 1-800-692-7753 spend hours on the phone all day with Apple support forcing me to try all the same tricks over again to get the phone to work. NOTHING works, finally they agree to let me send it back but say they have to cancel the old order to do that. (I assume that means the financing that trade in as well) She refunds what I had paid and tried to order me a new phone only to tell me that ATT will not allow men to place another order for 24 hours and there is nothing she can do about that. I explain I have no phone that works at this point and was using a borrowed phone. I explain I cannot call for police or fire that it puts me at risk.She is very sorry there is nothing she can do it is all ATT at this point. At first they wanted to get my phone in for servicing instead of giving me a new phone, I insisted on a new phone. I was instructed to put the new SIM card from the defective phone in my old deactivated phone so I could have a phone. I did that.  3/1/21-Call ATT, finally they give me a sales rep to tell me they are sorry but they can do nothing. Wait for 24 hours.  March 2, 48 hours later I sill can‚Äôt place order online because ATT still has a hold on being able to order a new phone. Now Apple says ATT requires up to 72 hours to reactivate a phone after one is cancelled.  March 3, 72 hours later I couldn‚Äôt order on Apple or ATT, old iPhone 100% dead now and can‚Äôt complete the verification code required by ATT sent to my messages because phone is dead. Can‚Äôt call anyone either. No chat function on Apple, found a chat function on ATT Spent over an hour being told my only option was to come into the store. I explained I cannot do that. They said I could call customer service and I explained I cannot do that because I have no other phone and my phone is dead. They do not serve us with landlines out here and my iPhone is my only communication device. They said they couldn‚Äôt help me. They said to try back tomorrow and see if someone there can help me.  I can‚Äôt order a phone online unless I can verify my old number and phone through text they send but I can‚Äôt do that because my phone is dead. I can‚Äôt call to order on the phone and I can‚Äôt go into the store.  March 4-8 days after receiving my new defective Iphone Fedx Tracking shows old phone returned. ATT- 30 minutes to tell me until Apple removes the installment plan from my account they can‚Äôt finance it.  Apple After being forced to go support I am rerouted to Sales Comes back with needing to ask more questions to tell sales. Wanting to know if this is a new phone return  Finally sales- shows the phone returned but said their process takes at least a couple of days to notify ATT-He could not do anything to speed that up but his goal was to make me happy. He was so sorry but could do NOTHING to help me. I am on my 8th day of trying to buy a new iPhone and being told it will take at least 2 days to a week more from Apple's side and who knows how much more time from ATT. Are they trying to run me away. I have been long time customer of both but this experience has been the most bizarre and  soul crushing as I have ever experienced. When you send a defective phone another one should be sent overnight and the paperwork to switch financing should take place behind the scenes. All of this time and heartache, I still don't have a phone. I am aghast. They deserve a -a million stars for this.",US

Out of nowhere, it stopped turning on (flickering on and off at the Apple logo) and later got stuck in recovery mode with error 4013. I scheduled a phone appointment, who only scheduled an appointment at Best Buy for me. At Best Buy, they told me my only option was to replace the phone for $550. They couldn't identify the issue, only saying it *might* be a problem with the board. I scheduled another appointment at the Stanford Apple Store where I was again told my only option was to replace the iPhone XS for out-of-warranty price of $550 ($50 less than the NEW iPhone 11).  I was given mixed answers every time about the possible issue (maybe a problem with the lightning port, maybe a problem with the logic board, maybe a problem with the software). I was told to ""yes, go to a 3rd party person to fix it... actually no, don't go to a 3rd party person to fix it"". I was told that I could then get it replaced for a price of $279, and then they turned around and told me ""whoops, we looked at the wrong thing, that can only be if there's a display issue, it's actually still $550, or you can buy a new phone"". My phone didn't even turn on, which is a worse issue than the display, yet I couldn't even get it replaced for that price. After wasting hours researching fixes, talking to customer service on the phone, & driving 2 hours, nothing was done to ensure this wouldn't happen again or to comp me for an issue on APPLE'S part.

In Autumn 2020, I had a problem one morning where it wouldn't turn on. There was nothing to show anything had gone wrong. I take very good care of it. It just wouldn't turn on, or acknowledge the charger was plugged in. So I tried my housemates laptop with the same charger. Unknowingly blowing 2 laptops logic board. All apple products and Apple chargers.   After hours talking to apple support about my options and visiting 2 different apple stores (which takes ages and is a total show where you are made to feel like a highly valued, yet, absolute idiot) I paid ‚Ç¨500 for each laptop for the new logic boards.

I was told it was a battery issue so I was given a new charger. A month or two later I took it in again and was given another new charger and no explanation as to why the Macs batter wasn't detected and wouldn't work without it being plugged in 24/7. I then took it in a third time and this member of staff took the Mac out the back and brought it back to show me the insides. The battery was leaking and had completely corroded whole board inside. (This could have been prevented if the first person I spoke to had done this to start with.  I was then told it would be around ¬£1,500 for the repair that it needed and I was best of just buying a new MacBook which is not what I wanted to do.

I received an apology by the manager who told me I would be better off buying a new Mac than getting the repair. I wanted to take this further so the manger offered me a discount on a MacBook. This was agreed that the laptop would be ¬£1,399.20 with a 24 month contract and a 14.9% interest rate. I agreed to this and was accepted through the Barclays partner finance app that the manager went through with me. However their systems weren't allowing anything to go through Barclays so I was sat waiting around for 2hours to be asked to come back the next day.  I went back the next day and the system was down still so I had to sit about for another 2 hours. At this point the manager offered me a case for the laptop free of charge. I sat for another hour with still no progress so I requested that it be stopped as I no longer wanted the Mac due to the wait. The manager then offered me another deal in which the interest rate would be dropped. I was told that the Mac would be ¬£1399.20 and there would be no interest. I agreed to this and agreed to wait a bit longer. The manager then came over and explained that it had finally went through however it would show as a 24 month contract but it would be around a 20 month contract instead as they would be taking care of the interest. He explained that I would be paying ¬£67.16 a month until the ¬£1399.20 was paid. This was what I had agreed to.  With that I received my receipt which stated the price would be ¬£1399.20 and I received my paper work from Barclays parter finance which has a total balance of ¬£1399.20 to repay and absolutely no mention of interest.  Skip forward to now. The full ¬£1399.20 has been repaid as well as more and they are charging me interest.  Spoke to Barclays and because it is an apple mistake they can't do anything about it as they didn't receive anything from apple to state interest won't be charged.  With this being an in store issue it is in store who need to resolve this however due to covid restrictions the store is closed. I tried to call the store numerous times and got no answer so rang the customer service line.  Spoke to a lady who explained there was nothing they can do as it was an in store issue but with me not being able to get in any form of contact with the store she agreed to escalate the case as I requested.  Spoke to a second agent who advised that he can see what he can do, took all the information etc to then say that apple have no procedures in place to deal with in store issues due to the COVID restrictions so I would need to wait until 'soon' at a financial expense to me until the store reopens and I can deal with this in store. I advised that the complaints get closed within a certain time frame so I wouldn't be able to escalate this again in which he advised I have a month. If the store is not open within a month I have lost out on ¬£250-¬£300+ which I should not be paying. This agent refused to accept this. I requested to go through to customer relations and was refused multiple times to then be given abuse off the agent, being spoke over and told ""you are in complete denial you can not speak to customer relations"" and then hung up on. I will be seeking legal advise, passing this onto the ombudsman and taking it to small claims court. Every time I get any apple products i always end up being miss sold, lied to and left to deal with it by myself with no help from customer service. They let me leave the store with a battery that was leaking due to water damage on the Mac and slowly corroding the inside of the Mac which could have caused an injury or anything as it was having to be plugged in to be used then I'm being told I need to pay an extra ¬£250-¬£300+ due to their mistake.",GB

I have spent hours chasing this including three calls to Apple - with no update call back. Finally, today i got a customer service guy who did something - he phoned the hub (I gave him the direct number) where he was told there was a scan on 10/02 but now they cannot find the package - does this suggest stolen perhaps? So now I have to wait until Apple take up a missing package process with UPS - Apple guy has no idea how long this will take. If package is missing I am told IMAC will be re-sent - of course it will I have paid for it!!!   MAC is a customised spec so will take some time to build and will be re-sent by, yep you guessed it UPS. How can they be trusted to do this? It is like Groundhog Day. I expect significant financial compensation from Apple as they are not meeting their part of the contract ie to deliver to me by a set date, whilst sitting on my cash. Apple, dump UPS they have a worse rating than you on Trust Pilot - look at the comment they are totally incompetent.

I would press the start button for good long time but nothing changed.  I am not a tech savvy person so naturally I brought the phone to a professional who told me they could not do anything but for me to wait for the battery to wear itself out.  This took days.  Anyone who has been using smartphone for a longest time can testify how the device has become an integral part in someone's life, how we have become dependent on one for assistance.  So the solution was not helpful and my iPhone was one of the latest models.  Recently, my Apple TV is informing that it no longer supports YouTube and I need to purchase newer model.  My Apple TV is still in perfect condition but somehow I have to fork out AUD300 to get a new model.  This comes from a company that prides itself with updates (probably the reason why my iPhone freezed in the first place) but could not update my current Apple TV model... I think Apple no longer reflects what the late Steve Jobs envisioned for the users - to empower them and the cultivation of creativity freedom.   Nowadays, using Apple products feels like in a concentration camp - all controlled and dictated by a very draconian approach from Apple.  This company is an expert in disillusionment and aim to manipulate their users with their fancy marketing ploys.  I humbly urge people to think carefully before they purchase another Apple product.

She claimed I would receive an email with an authorisation hold on my card for replacement AirPods. I didn‚Äôt get this email instead I received a thanks for contacting email and a CASE CLOSED notification. What annoys me is I double checked my email addressed and asked her to confirm that she would send this email which she did. Clearly she blatantly lied which I don‚Äôt appreciate nor do I appreciate my time being wasted like that.  She spoke ridiculously fast and didn‚Äôt make any sense.  It sounded like I got through to a call centre in India. I asked her to slow down and speak clearly but she continued to speak fast.

Her grasp of English was very poor because what she was saying didn‚Äôt make sense and she spoke fast to disguise that.   There was something untrustworthy in the way she was speaking and the way she was trying to fob us off.

Because I used to be able to register an Apple I.D. without having to use a phone number. However, the Apple company is now being controlled by American terrorists and Chinese terrorists who are anti-online privacy. Requiring me to enter my phone number to prove my identity just proves how they are anti-online privacy and they want to have their terroristic governments gather personal information about me instead of them politely minding their own damn business by not requiring me to enter a phone number and spying on my online activities. Apple doesn't have a justifiable reason to say that it cares about privacy because it's headquartered in a country that legalises gag orders. The other disappointment is that Apple's modern products have become expensively degenerated ever since Steve Jobs has passed away, which makes Apple not be able to hold a candle to its former glory anymore. Getting rid of the headphone jack lets me know that Apple doesn't care about audiophiles. What's really frustrating to me is that I've seen the quality of the customer support service from Apple drastically deteriorate because quality employees from Apple have been replaced by lazy employees who are only doing their jobs for a paycheck. I'm not surprised because more people are wanting to use Android phones, the Windows operating system, and/or the Linux operating system because they are tired of having Apple products cost an arm and a leg that don't last for more than 2 years. Because Apple's modern products have prices that have been rising to the point that only rich kids and rich adults can afford Apple products most of the time. Sorry, but I'm not going to enter my phone number and support a company that is controlled by Chinese terrorists who brainwash people with re-education camps, brainwashing censorship, and brainwashing social credit systems.

I personally love my watches but this is the last thing that I moved to purchase because to be honest, an electronic watch and it‚Äôs lack of appreciated value over time never appealed to me but my daughter, who has also become an ‚ÄòApple lover‚Äô convinced me to get one. I found the beautiful middle ground of the series 6 Hermes leather single tour deployment buckle (order number: W807248574 just to show how genuine this is) and this was delivered in mid Nov. I didn‚Äôt use it because of the lockdown and only started to use it really around Christmas time and on random occasions since then. I don‚Äôt wear my watches within the house so as soon as I walk in it‚Äôs off so it looks practically brand new apart from the now problematic strap that is the main reason that it costs ¬£1449!!!, which has started to fray, like a watch that is many years older.

In all honesty this thing (watch) wasn‚Äôt even worth the hype as are all products Apple are churning out these days and the competitors are doing much better right now. What they don‚Äôt realise is I had just purchased nearly ¬£5000 worth of products upgrading the family‚Äôs‚Äô gadgets and that stuff IS within the returns period so it IS all going back and the chain event of my contacts knowing this as well will also cost them a small drop of something.

1905,www.apple.com,2021-02-01T17:15:52.000Z,1,Screen fault and consumer rights act,"From the very beginning I experienced a pixelated screen, it occurred spontaneously and only lasted a second or so, I thought I was perhaps imagining the issue as it was so instantaneous and I could never capture it on a camera. After explaining this to an apple support provider within the 6 months of purchasing the product, I was advised there was little they could do without evidence of the issue. To be clear, this fault lasted a second or less on most occasions and appeared differently every time, very difficult to capture. I took it into the apple store (locally), within the first 6 months of owning the MacBook, they ran tests and kept the Mac for 2 days, they couldn‚Äôt replicate the issue and it passed all diagnostics tests. At this point I had already spoken to multiple different apple support advisors, spent hours of my time trying to negotiate a repair and travelled into a town centre during a lockdown to try and get it fixed, missing significant periods of university work time. I was told to keep the Mac and no further action was needed. A few weeks later I just so happened to get a picture of the screen fault (around 6 months into owning the Mac). After calling apple again, I was advised to upload pictures and take it into a repair shop. The repair took about 5 working days. Weirdly this time the diagnostics flagged up a fault with the screen. They replaced the screen. One week after the repair I noticed the screen flickering again, and now it has been two weeks after the repair the screen is significantly compromised. The screen becomes pixelated and unreadable. I have asked for a refund due to the enormous inconvenience of this issue and because I don‚Äôt have the time to return it again, wait a week, only to have a faulty product once again. Currently I am in my final year of veterinary medicine studies, a very stressful and demanding time, this issue haas been ongoing for 7-8 months, I am exhausted by it and very stressed, I just don‚Äôt want the product anymore. Without a laptop I have been totally incapable of completing assignments and revising for exams, this is a significant inconvenience. Alongside this, I have had to drive to and from an apple store twice, of which take one hour each way to commute to, I have had no expenses refunded to me despite this being a fault with the product from their end, paying for parking every time I visit the store (4 times now). I have spent over 20 hours on the phone to different apple support advisors, none of which have ever met me with a mutually amicable agreement. I have been told to await a call back from an advisor, only to never receive one. I have expressed my frustration, anxiety and stress over this faulty product and the detrimental impact it has had on my studies, which has been completely ignored by the apple team.  I have explained that I no longer want this Apple Mac product, I quoted the consumer rights act 2015 and the final right to reject, all of which were ignored by the apple team as they refused to refund/replace. I have undergone one replacement which was unsuccessful and lengthy, therefore my claim falls under the final right to reject. Apple have stated the repair was done under the warranty, however I did not consent to this. I wanted the repair and the following case to be dealt with under the consumer rights act 2015, which would therefore give me the right to a refund/replacement. The reason apple have used the warranty instead is to void my right to a replacement or refund. Apple have told me that my only option now is to wait another week, drive another 2 hours, drop the MacBook off at the same service provider that didn‚Äôt initially fix it, be without a MacBook (or any laptop) for another week (despite having exams next week and moving location every 3 weeks because I am on my final year rotations), only to commute again, pay for parking again, to retrieve a product I no longer want and be a significant loss (time, money and effort), with apple suffering absolutely no detriment.  Under the Consumer rights Act 2015, final right to reject, I demand this product be either fully refunded or replaced and my expenses be paid for.  I have looked under the information sent to me, at no point is it explicit that I have been given a 2 week period to reject the item once purchased, which can be applied to any product providing it is not bespoke. Therefore if apple choose to ignore all other consumer rights, I want to apply for a full refund via this law- something I was never made aware of initially.  It should be essential that when spending a significant amount of money on a product, if it does not conform to a satisfactory quality, it should be repaired/replaced or refunded. I have already attempted the repair option, it was unsuccessful. Apple have dealt with this case terribly.",GB

Lots of other iPhones work fine here . iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iphone 11 , anyway the iPhone 12 Pro will not receive a call and if it barely does you can‚Äôt hear anything and you will lose the call . It‚Äôs horrible and basically a phone that can‚Äôt be used and no word what so ever about when or even if Apple knows how to fix the iPhone 12 Pro. And yes I have tried resetting network settings, airplane mode , hard resets , you name it and it won‚Äôt fix it . Apple knows they have a problem so I am starting to think that if they haven‚Äôt fixed it by now these iPhone 12 pros may be no good",US

I spoke with a lady representative in apple customer service who was very kind and friendly, she tried to take the payment again whilst I was on the call and again it was refused  and she advised that I should call my bank to arrange for the payment of ¬£999 to be authorized. I spent the next 22 minutes on the phone to sort out the problem with the bank and was advised to call Apple back to arrange for the payment to be retried to see if there where any further problems.  When I called Apple to ask them to try the payment again I spoke with a male representative. He advised that the problem would now be fixed and the system would automatically retake the payment at 3pm the same day. When I tried to explain to him the situation he continued to talk over me and tell me the problem would now be fixed. I ask the representative to listen to what I was try to explain and he cut off the call.  This is not the type of customer experience I would expect from a company such as Apple and for such a large purchase of close to ¬£1000 or for any amount to be honest.

He said since it had already been activated, he was not able to reactivate.  He offered to do 3 months free of AppleTV, and said that‚Äôs the best he could do.  Since I had been working on this issue for over 3 hours, I just took the 3 months of AppleTV for my mom.

From my experience, their laptops are really good quality but their smaller devices aren't that great. My first purchase ever from apple was an iPad 3rd generation (about 10 years ago) and let me tell you, it was so glitchy and it kept crashing. After multiple visits to the Apple Store, they replaced it for me for free; which made me happy because there was something wrong with it. With the iPhone 5, it was really good except the battery would drain almost completely after a few hours. With the iPhone 5, they would not cover it under the Manufacture's Warranty and said that the battery was fine when it clearly wasn't. Fast forward many years later, iPhone Xr is very good, fast, battery lasts for days.  Point is, my experience with Apple is good when the product is good. When the product doesn't work, I am really upset. It's good when they try to resolve the issue. I do recommend the MacBooks though. My MacBook is almost 10 years old and it's still running really well. In case anyone's wondering, I never buy AppleCare, I just buy a really good case for the product so that the screen doesn't shatter if I drop it.  Customer service at Apple is hit and miss. I know Apple likes to empower the customers by teaching them to troubleshoot instead of troubleshooting it themselves; I have mixed feelings about that because it can come off a bit lazy from the customer's perspective and it's not good for customers that aren't technologically savvy.  I do think Apple is overpriced. I only purchased a new iPhone after using the previous one for many many years and there's too much glitches/issues with the product at that point.",CA

1959,www.apple.com,2021-01-19T10:02:49.000Z,1,An absolute Shamble,An absolute Shamble. I ordered a MacBook Pro worth over ¬£3500. The product was shipped from China with UPS. Apple used the cheapest delivery service available from UPS and the product is now stuck at the customs in the UK due to a missing commercial invoice.  Apple seems to be prompt in charging the consumers with so much money and only provide them with a basic service. Let alone they couldn't care less about the logistics side of things once the product leaves the warehouse. I am disappointed and I feel I am being robbed.  I will be cancelling the order and I will never purchase any more Apple products again. Marks my words!,GB

In the 6 months of owning my mac it had the screen\ and the keyboard replaced. When the screen failed AGAIN, they agreed to replace my computer. Their options were; 1. Pay full price for a new one and they will refund me the difference once my broken mac is inspected (ie several week later) 2. Send the Mac back for inspection and if they are happy, they will send me a replacement. Rather than be a further $2000 out of pocket, I chose the later. Apple arranged for a courier to pick up the broken computer. Not only did they not arrive, but the tracking number that apple supplied also showed there was no active job linked to it. After around 20 calls to support (i am serious) i was passed on to my 4th ""senior advisor"" who basically wanted to start the process again. I have a life to lead outside of talking to Apple and waiting for their non-existent couriers to arrive ""sometime between 9am and 5pm"" so I have decided to abandon the case. I wonder how many other customers Apple simply wear down through their appaling ""customer service""? Thankfully in my case its a cheap laptop - it wont break me, but i would never buy a big ticket item from Apple as you might be thousands out of pocket with zero support. And all of the above happened within my warranty period. you couldnt make this up.",AU

ICLOUD IS FAR FROM SAFE!!! TONS OF IMPORTANT BACKED UP FILES GONE!!! 6 YEARS OF BACUKPS DESTROYED!!! Now you might wonder why? The simple truth is Apple is removing your files without letting you know... After I've been testing and analyzing files ""safety"" in ios or apple environment I came to the quick conclusion after barely a week... I photographed my new saved files on IOS and then checked EVERYDAY for a week if there were files being removed or missing without my knowledge. After only a couple of days apple had deleted MANY important files that I stored on iOS without letting me know.. For a very long time I was expecting this outcome since through the years files were just missing all of a sudden??? I almost thought I was getting crazy, being extremely aware and backing up files to icloud almost everyday now since I can't afford to lose important information and files that I store on my apple devices. Unfortunately you can back up as much as you want within APPLE iCloud but is not safe at all!!! FILES WILL BE MISSING AND FAST! Now I will get rid of all my Apple gear that I praised for years because of being naive and fall for the simplicity of many apple software and products. It's simply not worth investing your time with this FRAUD company! From now on I will get a REAL SAFE BACKUP using hard drives and never cloud again! Also whatever PC with a Microsoft environment, probably and android phone. Hope that this information will help others that has been in doubt and with the same issues regarding files and safety within Apple. It was ""fun"" trying out Apple and it's environments but it was FAR FROM WORTH IT since I'm now left with big amounts of lost data and information that will be extremely hard to recreate...  NEVER will I use or trust Apple again.",SE

He wanted a different color model, so we returned the phone on the 29th of December in order to exchange for a different phone. A week goes by and I have not received my refund. Long story short I made numerous calls between Apple and FedEx in hopes to track my package. Initially I had lost my receipt with the tracking no. but luckily I found it because I had sent the original return label via email to be printed. It is now January 11, 2021 and I called Apple with the tracking no. and SURE ENOUGH the product was returned on December 31st! Apparently Apple scanned the product back but decided to keep and not return my refund. It‚Äôs been over 3 weeks now and still no refund nor phone. Customer service was/is terrible! Not one ounce of acknowledgment, apology or taking accountability whatsoever with the 6+ reps I spoke to. The s*** they put me through of trying to find the tracking no. and possibly losing the product and losing over $1,000!!! May as well speak to automated machine with minimum service.  One, If Apple had done their jobs in the first place, I wouldn‚Äôt have gone through hell to find the tracking no. and should‚Äôve received the refund after being scanned in. And two, if I did not get a hold of the original return label, the package would‚Äôve been ‚Äúlost‚Äù with Apple receiving the phone, keeping my money of over $1,000 and screwing me over! I wonder how many times Apple have screwed customers over. This ‚Äúmistake‚Äù should‚Äôve never happened in the first place.
