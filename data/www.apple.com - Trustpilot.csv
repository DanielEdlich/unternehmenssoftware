I assume that as a seller they help their customer with problems and, if necessary, approach the supplier to find a solution. But in reality their customer support is to listen in a courteous manner, and then, by definition, to prove the consumer wrong. Their creativity for this is phenomenal! Thereby ignoring any legal obligation, or effort to help the customer.",BE

After a few months, the case began falling apart and the phone would literally fall out of the case.  I contacted Apple, which is an unbelievably difficult task to accomplish.  They initiated a case number and warranty claim.  This resulted in me being passed between 6 reps and hours on hold.  All the while each rep promised me that the case would be replaced and they would make sure the problem was resolved.  Eventually, after 4 days of back and forth they connected me to a guy that says he has resolved the problem and all I need to do is start over and go elsewhere as Apple has absolutely zero responsibility for their own product failures.  Even though they lured me into buying it, took the money and profit and maintained the relationship, now they drop the ball completely.  Of course I can always try to contact the original manufacturer but why promise me so much and waste so much of my time only to conclude that their customer service department is a complete waste of space?  If they had been upfront from the start, it would be much less of a customer service failure.  But now I have deeply negative feelings about Apple.  All over an overpriced phone case.

Whenever I have had a question or issue, their customer service team has always been quick to respond and extremely helpful. They have gone above and beyond to ensure that I am satisfied with my experience. I always recommend Apple to my friends and family because of their excellent products and top-notch customer service.

He showed an interest, acted friendly, then snatched it and ran. He/they drained his account and changed his number. Most organisations have been helpful; i.e. banks, fraud office etc.  Apple however just state there is nothing we can do? Adding, he needs to buy a new phone and set up a new account. They cannot even tell us if his old iCloud account is being used? How can you walk about with a phone permanently locked? The thieves basically have his identity! He rang Apple this morning and, as a caring father, I have just rung them too. In short, Apple staff have been rude and powerless to assist in a time of need. Technology seems amazing, until the user really needs assistance, then it just appears to be about getting more money from us. Why can't they close his old account, reassure him, and help him set up a new account?  Why can't they be civil and helpful to their customer?",GB

After purchasing a new Mac I called apple support to help set up my airdrop.  I was told  to connect the bluetooth, but after a lot of work the devises never would support a connection.  After a screen share session and much effort  I was told the computer was probably not working.  So I returned it and purchased an upgrade iMac.  The same thing happened though.  I then called tech support 3 different times to see if they can help me connect my newer iMac bluetooth to my iPhone.  After sensing a bit of  confusion l I was wondering why tech support seemed quite uninformed about this issue. Not one of the 4 calls resulted in clarity that bluetooth is not supported or necessary. For such info I was able to discover within my own research that these devise do not connect via bluetooth.  The airdrop is automatically supported between devices.  It took a lot of back and for with Apple, and a big hassle it was to say the least.  I just wonder why tech support did not know this basic info.  I realize the information is easily discoverable via a Google search.  I probably will no longer rely on Apple tech support any more after this experience.",US

You seem determined to make it as difficult as possible for customers seeking redress,"In June 2021 I bought a high spec 24‚Äù iMac at a cost of ¬£2,500 from the UK Apple Store.  I was very happy until, out of the blue, it failed completely on 14th December 2022 in the middle of a Teams call.  I was not able to restart it. I contacted Apple who ran through some basic diagnostics and advised me to take it to an authorised repairer. I was told that my iMac was out-of-warranty as it was more that 1 year old, the implication being that I would need to pay for a repair. I delivered it to an iStore in Guildford on 16th December 2022. On the 20th December 2022 the iStore informed me that in addition to the ¬£90 diagnostic fee I had already paid I would need to pay ¬£475 for a new Logic Board. This seemed outrageous for a product that was 18-months old. On reviewing my rights as a consumer I wrote to Apple. The letter included the following: The Consumer Rights Act 2015 makes it an implied term of the contract I have with Apple that goods be as described, fit for purpose and of satisfactory quality. As you are in breach of contract and I've owned the product between 6 months and 6 years, I am within my statutory rights to ask for it to be repaired. The reply came back that I had sent this to the wrong place in Apple and I should contact Apple Care. 22 December 2022 - I speak to an advisor - John - who assures me he will take ownership and resolve the issue for me. He sounds very uncertain and hesitant when he learns that I am referencing consumer rights law to require Apple to pay for the repair. However, he eventually gives the iStore the go-ahead to complete the repair. He sends me a link to a site that allows me to leave a message and /or voicemail for him if I need further help. 6 January 2023 - iStore inform me that they have tried various ways to fix the iMac but nothing works. They are at a loss as to how to repair it. I contact John via the link he has sent me but get no response. 8 January 2023 - I call Apple Support and speak to Daniela who assures me she understands how frustrating this is and she will now take ownership of the case and resolve my issue. At this stage I ask for a like-for-like replacement of the iMac since it appears to be impossible to repair. She needs to talk to another department in Apple to see if this can be done but as they do not work on weekends cannot progress it further. She promises to call me the next day. 9 January 2023 - Daniela calls and says that she has confirmed with the iStore that they do not know how to repair it. She tells me that I need to collect the faulty iMac from the iStore and when I have it to let her know so that she can see if the machine can be replaced. When I question why I need to collect it to send to them rather than have the iStore send it to them and why she could not guarantee that it would be exchanged, her response was that this is how we do things and there can be no deviation from that. 10 January 2023 - I call the iStore to arrange to collect the faulty iMac the following day. 11 January 2023 - The iStore text me to say that they are not sure that they can have the iMac reassembled in time to collect that day. I contact Apple Support to express my frustration with the process. I speak to Paulo who assures me he understands my frustration and that he will now take ownership and resolve my problem. When I insist that I need progress on the replacement he proceeds to process a like-for-like replacement order even though I do not yet have the iMac in my possession. He asks me to ensure the iStore repair order completion is sent to him stating that the device is not repairable. While talking to him a text comes through telling me that the iMac is ready for collection from the iStore. I pick up the faulty iMac and the iStore immediately volunteer a refund of the ¬£90 diagnostic fee (well done iStore!) and send me the repair order completion. I forward the repair order completion immediately to Paulo via the link he sent me and as a reply to the email (belt and braces). 12 January 2023 - update to follow",GB

As it now turns out it was bought way to early as I was under the misguided thinking that the warranty kicks in when the product is activated and not when purchased and how wrong I was.  My daughter decided to wear the watch on Christmas Day as it had not been worn in a while ( but had been charged ) and it would not activate. It registered on her phone and on the find my iPhone app. We tried factory reset but to no avail.Today was the first opportunity I had to contact an authorised Apple repair centre and explained my case and was told that I MAY be able to get it repaired under European consumer law ( two year warranty ). I was then told to contact Apple to see would they authorise the repair but was passed to a manager who was very quick to tell me that I had mentioned European consumer law to one of his customer service agents and it was a legal process and they must adhere to the law. He clearly stated that Apple should have been informed within the two years but as I previously wrote above I incorrectly thought the warranty kicks in on activation. He did offer a replacement at approximately the cost of a new watch but I politely declined. If a two year warranty is a legal matter for Apple then why are their authorised sellers offering two year warranties. I would just encourage anyone thinking of buying an apple product to make themselves very familiar with the Apple warranty ( and what is included ) , it‚Äôs starting date and also their rights under European law. I would encourage consumers to contact Apple if they have any issues with their apple products well within their warranty period and to clarify if they are entitled to the extended warranty under European law ( at no cost ).

However, after two dropped calls (after being on hold about 45 minutes each call) and finally getting through on the 3rd call they still are unwilling to honor their commitment. They are now saying that it looks like the subscription was signed up for during the one-year period so I am no longer eligible. I told them tonight, as I have on every call, that I was unable to access the subscription. However, they said that they see in their notes that it looks like I signed up for the subscription and had it available - absolutely not true. Tonight after over 30 minutes I'm talking to a manager from Apple named Leonard. At the end of the call he said that he can forward a complaint on my behalf, but it's unlikely that anyone from Apple will follow up and contact me.

I bought my new SE about a week ago and the audio wasn't working properly, amongst other things, and the first support man shared my screen and ran a diagnostics check on it.  He didn't tell me the result but muttered something about a repair.  I said I didn't want it repaired, that it was only days old.  He then said we should update it.  Clicked on that and it said it would take 4 minutes - the support man said after 4 minutes it would switch off and then on again and everything should be alright.  That he would send me an email with a case number and if there was any problem I should get them to ring me back.  Well it got stuck at 2 seconds at the end for ages and then went onto a screen that said update to version 16.2, which it already was.  I then tried to get Apple to ring me back but when the call was scheduled it had the wrong number to contact me.  I then had to get onto Chat to tell them about that.  At some point I had a message that I would be put through to Repairs - that's when I lost it.  Eventually I got another support man on the phone who asked me what was wrong and when I started explaining about the audio he started shouting at me saying he didn't understand what I was saying.  I kept having to repeat it, but of course it wasn't just the audio anymore it was the fact that the update wasn't working and other things weren't working.  He got quite aggressive and I asked him why he was shouting at me which made him worse.  It was really awful.  Eventually the line went dead. I tried ringing the Apple store at Milton Keynes where I'd bought the phone.  It goes through to a central answering thing and I spoke to a really nice woman who told me that of course I didn't have to have it repaired I could take it in and get a replacement or my money back.   I have noticed before that when Apple can sort out your problem they send you a feedback form but if they don't get you sorted then they don't send one, so the person you have been speaking to never gets a bad review.

I called on the last day of the return window, telling best buy reps at the store, at the phone number on the back of the credit card, and at the geek squad desk that I can‚Äôt use the product nor the case designed specifically for the product. 3. I described my Allergic reaction, which began upon opening the product‚Äôs factory sealed cellophane & box, becoming severe within ~ a minute or so, and was the same type of allergic reaction that I have had in the past to Mold/MRSA exposure 4. Luckily, I had both rescue inhaler and epinephrine auto inject pens in case of another exposure. I contracted a serious sinus (MRSA) infection, ill 9 days after opening the seal & required Specialist appointments at $ 35.00 each & specialized meds, lasting thru May/June ~ $ 300 5. Best Buy, after several calls & disconnects, said I couldn‚Äôt return nor exchange it, I had to try Apple. 6. Apple directed me, after several calls to Simply Mac to have it evaluated on site & then return & exchange could be processed‚Ä¶ 7. Simply Mac evaluated it & tried several times over several weeks to get in touch with Apple, with no luck. They told me to call Apple back. 8. Again, I tried to resolve the issue with Apple. After several days of calls, where I was interrogated by the Risk management department, they said it was not their problem and the Mold/MRSA came from Best Buy. 9. Eventually I tried the My Best Buy credit card company and have been re-sending the same data over and over again. Apparently there are no people at the address given on the statement: PO BOX 70601, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19176-0601, nor at the address provided in the form letter denial with no specifics to my case listed in the letter beyond item & price & date, no person‚Äôs name nor department name, nor contact number nor extension for which to contact them. Second address was PO BOX 790441, St. Louis, MO 63179-0441. 10. All documentation was mailed via certified mail, so the mail center staff exists‚Ä¶ They receive payments, after all. 11. The letter also suggests trying the toll free best buy store & credit card phone numbers. The representatives said that there is no dispute department available. 12. The online dispute form section only gives computer generated responses to repeated attempts to have the case examined at all. 13. Total Time wasted ~ 19+ hours on Phone calls (10+). Online form completions (5+). Robo- generated requests repeatedly ask for the same data & forms. Prep/paperwork & Visits to the post office (4+) to mail the same paperwork to 2 different post office boxes via certified mail (over $ 20 in copies & postage) with a only an unsigned, Robo ‚Äìgenerated reply for only the first written submission. 14.

191,www.apple.com,2022-12-04T19:25:37.000Z,1,I would give 0 stars if possible,"I would give 0 stars if possible. 1 star is too generous for this company of unserious people only good to take your money when you purchase their garbage products. IPhone 12 pro max purchased September 2021. After updating May 2022, lost cellular signal. Apple would not accept it for control, they advised resetting the phone, I lost all my data, but the phone was functioning. Same problem, no signal after update July 2022, same approach, reset, lost all my data again. 3rd time 10 days ago, Apple would not accept it without charging me because 12 months went out, pointed me to the shop I purchased it. The shop starts mumbling about 12 months warranty, I remind them we live in EU, they point me to mcare, a service point. Service point resets my phone, of course I lose all my data one more time (3rd time in half year!), but I keep my patience and I get a working phone from mcare in Stockholm, last Friday 2nd December 2022. Today, 2 days after I got it from mcare service, the phone went totally dead and I am writing from a 200 euro Huawei which is 5 and a half years old and works still like it should. I contacted Apple support, only solution is to take it back where I purchased. I mean, what is this? Why should we pay 1500 euros for something that has no support at all? I am a surgeon that relies on my phone and it's impossible to keep going like this. It's not about the money, but why wouldn't you take responsibility when you deliver faulty products? This is totally unacceptable. I had never such problems with much less expensive phones. Untill you make this right I won't ever reconsider getting any of your products, not even for 20% of the retail price, it doesn't worth the hassle arguing with you. This is supposed to be Apple support??? I will take this garbage to the shop tomorrow and I really hope that you prove me wrong, because right now for me you are common small crook thieves.

192,www.apple.com,2022-12-31T18:49:21.000Z,1,My final word on Apple.,"I fail to understand how this company is even in business let alone successful. Or actually I do, they prey on the fact that people will pay exorbiant amounts of money to get nothing so long as others do it too and its ‚Äúcool‚Äù or everyone else is doing it. The iphone se I am using right now I sincerely regret buying and to think I had considered the iphone 13. Its a bunch of hot garbage. Who needs a logo with a bite taken out when something as trivial as typing is an absolute pain in the a$$. Like my fingers are in pain just writing this review and thats saying something because on my old motorolla phone (the most budget 200$ phone you could buy) my fingers never hurt and typing was fine. The app store is a garbage dump of ads and lousy apps that constantly spam you with ads and ask for money. The google play store is superior in every way. Even the reviews on the app store are biased to apples content since they claim mainstream apps only have a couple thousand reviews which is obviously nonsense. (Or the alternative that apple deletes reviews they don‚Äôt like) But on top of that you only get to see a few of the preselected reviews they want you to see. My home screen looks like someone threw up on it and is practically unusable. The customiztions are almost nonexistent and changing how it looks is such a pain you just want to throw your phone in the trash. I disabled autocorrect because not once did it help it just made an already awful typing experience worse so I am used to autocorrecting myself and constantly having to retype what I wrote (case in point has to retype ‚Äúwrote‚Äù 3 times). I can‚Äôt so much as rearrange the order of apps let alone make a gap between them so I can make things look as they should and be more productive. Why are so many people high on the cameras? I find the photos to be okay at best and the night mode on the se is nonexistent. If the lighting is bad the photo looks like it was shot on some cheap camera from a 10 dollar drone you ordered from aliexpress if that. Shall I continue? I‚Äôll take that as a yes (your fault you chose to read on) when I make a damn hotspot it not only takes about a full minute to actually turn on, it also will randomly turn off for no good reason and yes, it was actively connected. Yes I checked ever online tip and article in existence yeah I burned another 30 braincells and valuable time on this awful company. In my dads words ‚Äúthe iphone isn‚Äôt fun to use but I survive‚Äù he‚Äôs right and I respect that but I‚Äôll let my standards dictate what I‚Äôm going to survive on and if the most widespread phone brand fails to do that, then I won‚Äôt be using them anymore. Thank god I didn‚Äôt buy a macbook or airpods they are somehow worse and I haven‚Äôt gotten the pain of experiencing it firsthand yet. Lets do better people spend the hour or two with a trusted friend or website finding your needs and buy something you will actually enjoy using in the future. Maybe even for old times sake when people bothered using their brains once in a while, pull out that trusty notebook you never actually used and jot down some standards for what you want not what they want cause that I canspell out for you; YOUR-MONEY (Save a hot load of money too think free music and the ability to download stuff like apks or customize your homescreen or not pay anymore subscriptions or just upfront pay half the price for one hell of a better piece of tech that has been forced to innovate and prove itself.)",IL

All efforts to rectify this became a pain in the bum because my kids so stressed me out to fix it.  Fom one roadside charger to another and not working afterwards. Until I thought why not go to Apple directly, whom I bought both IPADs from.  I popped into 02 Store in Woolwich and asked for Apple IPAD chargers.  The agent told me both chargers would set me aback by ¬£48.  I screamed because I had been used to buying roadside chargers for ¬£10 max, which stopped working a week after.  I took the risk and bought both chargers for ¬£48 and for the next 7 months, I had respite from my kids - no more charger challenge anymore, until recently when both chargers stopped working and all hell was let lose.  My kids are so used to their IPADs the way I am so used to my smart phone. So I know what they are going through each time they can't get their IPAD to work.  I went back to the 02 store for warranty replacement and was told to contact Apple directly.  I did and Apple fixed an appointment for me to pop into their nearest store at Stratford to get the items replaced.  I visited apple Stratford and got both chargers replaced, bran new without any questions. At Apple shop Stratford, I was not only wowed by their excellent customer service amidst a huge endless crowd, I was bowled over by Apples display of a vast array of 21st century gadgets, ranging from smart iPhones to tablets and PCs. And I remembered Steve Jobs of blessed memory and his subsisting legacy, the Apple brand. May he continue to RIP.  I advise all and sundry, should you ever wish to purchase, any smart phones, tablets and PCs, please go to Apple for quality, and after care service.  Because you have purchased from Apple, (any product, even outside waranty) Apple will continue to look after you and that product for life.  Eg 2 IPADs (8 generation- 2020) I bought for my kids at the cost of ¬£450 each...  Even when it was outside warranty when my younger daughter (8yr old) had her screen broken, Apple offered me same product, bran new replacement at the cost of ¬£200 (which I considered to be a very ridiculous PRIZE). No seller out there will do similar. Hence I said if you must buy any smart phones, tablet or PCs, for Quality and your own peace of mind, pls buy ONLY from Apple cos Apple will look after u and your product for life...  Now, that's just a thought on Apple, Steve Jobs legacy.. May he continue to RIP.",GB

This sale(delivery) was such a bad experience, I was even cursed at and threatened )veiled threat) by the delivery driver (Uber, yes Uber),my product returned and now scrambling to try and get it by Christmas. I placed an order over the phone with a GREAT rep, she explained if I wanted before Christmas for $9.00 the product will be delivered by Monday (basically two days) by ‚Äúcourier‚Äù. Wow, how can you pass that up, right? She explained someone has to be at the delivery location at a scheduled time to sign for it. Knowing I couldn‚Äôt be there I gave specific instructions on where to bring it and someone who will sign(yes after the incident I checked the order it‚Äôs there). I got a call six times in a row on delivery day, I kept ignoring it, finally I picked up and scream (and cursed) who the *** is this? The person said Uber‚Ä¶I immediately said don‚Äôt call this number again and hung up. Another call and I picked up and screamed didn‚Äôt I said don‚Äôt ******* call this number? He screamed yo I got a delivery for you from Apple..I told well you got instructions on what do go do it don‚Äôt call‚Ä¶ than he said to watch the way you talk mother****** you a tough guy on the phone you think you a gangster punk mother****** , come down let‚Äôs see what happens to you‚Ä¶ Anyway my wife stopped me from running there‚Ä¶ I got an email saying order cannot be delivered, it‚Äôs being returned to the store and refund issued‚Ä¶. I waited about a hour or two calmed down, and called Apple. I explained what happened and they said now I have to replace the order and won‚Äôt be available for delivery till after Christmas, which I can‚Äôt understand, store, less than a mile alway and they are using Uber for deliveries, the latest or should have been able to be delivered with three days, really a hour to correct this mistake. The support person me she‚Äôll connect me with a sales rep and maybe they can get it deliveeed earlier than Christmas.  Now speaking with a sales rep, who I‚Äôm assuming is in the actual store (btw no such thing to speak to one from a store) this person tells me they don‚Äôt have this item in stock at the store at this time (mind you there‚Äôs a butt load of these products there I found out later and my order was just returned) I asked if he‚Äôs in the store he said no I‚Äôm in the sales department (not in a retail location)  I waited a couple of hours decided to call the store directly, for a person, he said there is a lot of them in stock, and I figured he‚Äôs in the store cause I called the store number (guess what he‚Äôs not, it gets routed to Apples sales centers which is not a retail location) Now I‚Äôm forced to try to find time to go to this store and pick up the new order all because a ‚Äúcourier‚Äù (Uber driver) didnt want to get out of his car to bring the delivery into a store for a signature as the delivery instructions stated. It was a horrible and disgusting experience.  The fact that Apple didn‚Äôt offer a comparable solution to the matter (placing the order and having redelivered immediately by ‚Äúcourier‚Äù),  or allowing people to speak with a person ina a physical retail location, and allowing these Uber drivers make deliveries for them is crazy.  They don‚Äôt understand this is Nyc Uber drivers aren‚Äôt getting out of their cars to make deliveries cause they one, to lazy, two can, in that short time get a stack of parking tickets.",US
199,www.apple.com,2022-12-19T01:37:15.000Z,1,Hard to trust employee information,"To Whom It May Concern: I am writing today to complain of the poor service and advice I received from Sherway Mall‚Äôs Apple store employee on November 30, 2022 that led me to purchase a fake iPhone and lose 1500$ in the process. I walked in to purchase a new iPhone 14 pro Nov 30th 2022 where the following took place: Your Apple employee advised me that there were no iPhone 14 pro‚Äôs available in stock and that I would have to reserve one by adding my name to a reservation list. The iPhone 14 pro would only arrive on December 28th. Unfortunately, this date would not work as I was scheduled to leave the country December 16, 2022. To my surprise, the employee proceeded to advise me that since I would be out of country Dec 28th, he could NOT add me to the reservation list. I proceeded to search the mall at all electronic stores who are licensed to sell Apple products/iPhone in attempt to locate said iPhone. With no luck, and no choice quite frankly, I started looking for iPhones in the online market. I located one on Facebook marketplace from an individual selling a brand-new iPhone boxed with receipt of purchase. This seemed legitimate, however, to be cautious and prior to completing this transaction, I phoned the Apple store at Yorkdale mall. This is where I spoke to an employee who verified the purchase based on the information on the receipt. The seller‚Äôs reason for selling was that ‚Äúhis father wasn‚Äôt an iPhone guy‚Äù. Your Apple employee assured and verified that this iPhone in question was in fact real according to the serial number and information on its receipt. However, once the transaction and exchange took place, I got home and quickly attempted to sync my iPhone with this new one only to learn that I had been scammed and this was a fake iPhone. Not only am I annoyed that I wasted a morning getting inaccurate information, being turned away by an Apple employee, but in turn due to my time constraints, I looked at other options one being to purchase an iPhone online (from a con artist). My impression of Apple has been tarnished, and I am now considering getting rid of all Apple products. I have been a loyal customer for over 15 years! My whole family has iPhones, iPhone watches, iPads, Apple desktop and laptops (including my businesses). Furthermore, your customer service representative gave inaccurate information when in fact I came to find out that Apple receives iPhones every two days if you walk in during shipment days you have an opportunity to get one (alternative to being put on the reservation list). Had I known this information, I would have made a more informed decision and gladly returned to purchase my new iPhone with confidence at an Apple store. Your service representative‚Äôs inability to provide accurate information has caused me duress, incurred expense relating to $1500 lost to a fake iPhone & now also a lost loyal customer. I would like to note that I have contacted police to file a report and they are unable to assist in these online fraud instances. I trust this is not the way Apple wishes to conduct business with valued customers‚ÄîI have been with you for many years and have never encountered such treatment before. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss matters further and to learn how you propose to prevent a similar situation from recurring. I look forward to hearing from you.",CA

Long story short the chip with this mac had issues from the start. I spoke to over 15 Apple service specialists. They even admitted at times that their were known issues with this model and the ability to upgrade operating systems (a necessity with Apple products for safety and other reasons) crashed the system. Mojave never worked right and I was led through numerous hoops.  So my son could never use his Christmas gift because it was always not booting or at the Apple store being repaired.  In the end they wanted to charge me $500 and would not offer any trade in value, well, because it didn't work. It didn't work because of the bad chip choice they made when they built it!

Once I did get it at the store, they started pressuring me to buy the Apple Care +. I said I'll decide when I get to use the phone for a few days or so. Fast forward a few days, I get the Apple Care +. A week later I decide to return the phone as I cannot get it to work for the apps that I generally use.  I called Apple Customer Support for help with my apps but they were useless.  It seems merit is not a prerequisite in their hiring protocols but the need to meet a certain inclusiveness. I go  back to the store to return the Iphone upon which they issue me a full refund. However when it comes to the Apple Care + refund, they told me I will have to call Apple in order to get my refund. I called Apple,  and after 2 hours of being passed about like a baseball they say they issued the refund. It took another week for the refund to clear my bank. Apple is a disaster, greedy and in the end they will fail. Follow up ....The refund that Apple issued for the actual iphone was by way of Paybright, the Company they use to finance your purchase should you decide to pay monthly for 2 years. Paybright issued the refund the next day but it took a solid week to have the refund posted back into my Credit Card. I had to call Paybright several times to ensure that a refund was coming. All the while my available credit on the Credit card was showing a debit of $2000 which I couldn't use for other purchases.  All in all my experience with Apple was a nightmare, one that I will never ever repeat. Both Apple and Paybright deserve each other.

I have been using iPhone Notes quite a while to store all my important notes such as passwords and important messages. It has been accumulated hundreds of notes over the year. It was pretty handy until a couple of days ago it suddenly disappeared! All of them! I did not do anything such as deleting or grouping etc. I was crazy about this lost as I can‚Äôt do my normal work without those Notes records. I looked up from internet to try to get some tips to retrieve them back. I‚Äôve tried all the methods suggested without success. I realised that my notes were not stored in either of my iCloud or my outlook account because both of these accounts were full and could not take sync from my iPhone. So I think all my notes were stored locally in my iPhone. I went to a few mobile phone shops and was told there is no way to recover those lost data. I called Apple technical support and was given 3 other data recovery companies. I tried again without any success. By looking up from Internet for more information, I can see quite a few people had these problems before. But very strange that they did not talk too much after raising this issue. I summarise all my findings here: 1. iPhone iOS has a bug in its Notes which can automatic remove locally stored data even you have upgrade to iOS16. Or maybe hardware storage is not stable (that may be dangerous to other data storage!) 2. iPhone Notes locally stored data lost cannot be recovered by any methods. 3. Apple cannot help at all and they don‚Äôt acknowledge this bug and they don‚Äôt want to take any responsibility to the data lost 4. Please use iCould or your email accounts to store your Notes rather than local stored. Also make sure those accounts have space to sync your iPhone notes.",AU

Went to Apple Store where I was told my phone was ‚Äúcactus‚Äù and blamed it all on internal damage from the glass back replacement and needed to pay for a new phone. Obviously I was very annoyed only having my phone for about a year. When I got home I noticed the battery sitting at 41% and staying on for sometime. I quickly plugged it in and was able to restore my phone without issues and now working perfectly fine and also running on iOS 16.0.3. Thanks for nothing apple.,AU

313,www.apple.com,2022-10-14T21:06:06.000Z,1,Apples phone are not guaranteed against water damage.,"I've used Apple most of my adult life and just about every device I have ever bought has had some manufacturing issue.  But as a designer I like Apple and I like the operating system so you end up staying with them. My most recent disaster was with my iPhone pro 11, I have just had the battery changed by Apple in Covent Garden and took it on holiday with me. While swimming I dropped it in the water but wasn't really bothered because it's waterproof and I have dropped it in water before. A day later the screen got a green line up it and was non operational to touch.  I took it to the Apple Store in Covent Garden and explain the situation. They explained that it had indeed got water damage, but wasn't covered by any warranty and never was since it was only water resistant. The Italian government have already taken Apple to court over this matter and I know there is further court action happening in New York. But it's still shocking when you hear someone sat in front of you saying that your waterproof phone is only water resistant and only at 8m for 30mins.  I said to the assistant that you find that statement contradictory. I also said it was clearly waterproof or water-resistant when you change the battery, to which she replied 'believe me Sir it would've been as good as the day it came out the factory if we replace the battery.' But they also said the glue they use to waterproof it weakens with time. That means 1 week I guess. Clearly this was not true since it had been in water before and never had a problem even though I had no idea that it was not waterproof but only water resistant and not covered ever by the warranty. To be honest when I bought it I don't remember it saying that it was only water resistant at eight meters for 30 seconds. But clearly Apple need to be more upfront about the water resistant claims since it contradicts the fact that they don't guarantee it and never did. It's a bit like me saying I'm a designer but I can't guarantee I can design.  I assume the same is true of my Apple Watch which I swim with!! In the end the silence was too much and the Apple assistance mouth was just oddly gawping at me.  It must be hard for these poor assistance to have to make excuses on behalf of their employer. So the bottom line is your phone is water resistant to x depth for X amount of time, plus it's also not advisable to take it into water because we don't guarantee it. It's really high time I left my dysfunctional relationship with Apple devices, hard as it is we can't go on. At the end of the day Apple probably have done some cost benefit analysis and decided the legal costs are worth factoring in.",GB

368,www.apple.com,2022-09-29T12:54:50.000Z,1,Apple placing vulnerable people at risk,"On Tuesday my partners iPhone locked her out from her phone. She had entered the lock screen code correctly; however, it was not recognised so she had to wait! After waiting she again entered the code, no joy! Eventually the phone completely locked her out for good.  Even tried the turn on and off method but again no joy. Tried to use a PC by accessing her iTunes account, however that rejected all password attempts, recovery attempts and creating a new password. iTunes then locked her out of that. I downloaded the Apple support App to my iPhone and connected Apple who called me back creating case number 101816350239. Basically, after lots of chit chat, we were told that we would have to wait for the Apple ‚Äúsystem‚Äù to allow access because the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù was sending verification texts to her phone but there was no way she could view them. We tried with the support worker various methods through the APP but nothing and again told would have to wait. Today (Thursday) my Partner received an email stating that she would have to wait until 28th October 2022 until the issue with the Apple Id and password recovery could be fixed. This I found completely unacceptable as my partner is has caring responsibilities towards a child and her father who has Dementia, so I contacted Apple again through the APP who then called back creating case number 101817389546 So, by now you can see that we are using my iPhone to communicate with Apple. In short, we were told that the Apple ‚ÄúSystem‚Äù cannot unlock the phone because they do not have enough information to verify her identity, however, was told that despite this, once the waiting period had elapsed (25th Oct 2022) the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù would allow her back into the phone. So, let‚Äôs look at this again, Apple stated that because they did not have enough DATA, they could not verify identity however if we could provide DATA, it would be unlocked, however we cannot provide that DATA as she cannot view texts sent to her by APPLE. However, if we cannot provide that DATA then she would gain access by 25th October 2022. It is clear that this is a way of harvesting DATA which in the UK is unlawful, we understand that Apple consider it as security steps, but we all know that Apple could unlock the account/phone etc if they really wanted to but harvesting DATA seems to be important to them. The other aspect is that my partner purchased an iPhone to access a service, yet Apple are now withholding that service through no fault of her own and in the UK that is unlawful. So, at great expense we have to go and buy a new phone (non-Apple, obviously) due to her caring responsibilities and because a multibillion-pound company does not want to sort this mess out that was created at the end of the day because Apple did not recognise her screen lock code on multiple occasions. Now I know, my partner is just 1 person amongst millions of iPhone users so the reality is that they wont bother with us minions, however it is important to share our experience with people which may include national media outlets as this is not right, they are placing those reliant of her care at risk.",GB

I wanted to reset my password (for most companies it is a straight forward job but not for all mighty Apple), to encounter a huge problem. They asked me to submit all via email and phone message (they emailed me and sent me a text to enter code, which I did), I punched their both codes to prove it is me and not a thief then they treated me as a thief. They said they will get in touch within 24h with further details. They did get in touch within 24h (on the 24h hour rather than a second earlier) only to say they will either call me or text me on 7 October to re-set my password. I was in shock. When I rang I was told they do not have enough date on me (I used to have Apple products from iPhone to Mac Pro but chose to switch to Samsung), hence I have to wait to reset my password. In this age and date one would think it is much easier to deal with anything, a question to Apple is, how much more data will you have for me on 7 October if you did not have enough now in order to re set my password. Imagine if  I was in need of  more complex issue!!! With such behaviour they put me off to purchase their new IPhone 14 pro and IPad, instead I will opt for Samsung 22 and 23 later on. They have way much better customer service and certainly do not need 3 weeks to re set password. Especially if they check your identity via your phone and email at the same time. Insane.

I don‚Äôt do subscription stuff like this, there‚Äôs not enough good music and I don‚Äôt have the time for it anyway. I spent a total of 7.5 hours trying to reclaim around ¬£200 of unexpected fees, back and forth between Apple (who confirmed I could neither subscribe to or use this service and acknowledged I had never accessed it as my devices are no longer supported and therefore unable) and my mobile contract provider 3mobile (who had taken the payments for Apple) they‚Äôve ripped me off for this petty amount of unauthorised subscription fees. I‚Äôm done. I can‚Äôt wait for my Fair Phone 4. I‚Äôm never going to buy or recommend Apple products again. iCloud storage is getting transferred and cancelled. Customer services isn‚Äôt what it used to be, products don‚Äôt work as intended (cloud doesn‚Äôt work properly, blue tooth is rubbish etc) Siri is a pain in the bum. 25 years of loyalty to Apple and 10 years with 3mobile over because they want to keep that extra ¬£200... well, no more of that. My next devices are going to be Fair Phone 4 and I‚Äôm going to stick with building my own PC‚Äôs and running them on Linux.  I‚Äôm also going to campaign for the prevention of sales of products that will not be supported before the end of life use expires. Letters going out to my MP today. You should all do the same.",GB

Draw your own conclusions from that. Apple‚Äôs business retail centre‚Äôs advice is on three occasions found to be lacking in accuracy.

It happened overnight.  It is under warranty. It spent a week with apple agents.  Agents have said it is not software, not battery and  unusual. Apple agree it is not right but all Apple do is insist they perform more tests. We are now 2 weeks on and they have run the same diagnostics over and over. Asked the same questions every call. Telling me there are more diagnostices to run.  It passes all their tests, but discharges 10% each hour whislt sitting on a desk. I have to pay the ¬£42 costs for the initial inspection where they tell me something is wrong and it is unusual. Now I have to wait another week for them to take a look at the next set of tests. So three weeks of looking at my phone to see if they can replace it, never once suggesting it is working as it should. I am told there is yet another set of diagnosis at the end of the three weeks. Almost 10% of the phones life spent in apples remediation process..... no obvious outcome yet.  So far over 4 hours on the phone, several hours more in the repair shop, a new phone costs Apple less than this if you charged out the time. So be warned, when you buy an i phone it should state clearly the battery life is expected to be under 8 hours within a year. Their telephone after sales service is non existant (lots of lovely people who cannot do anything). Their warranty is rendered inoperable for the burocracy. It all adds up to a major issue with the description of the goods under the sale of goods act in the UK. Escalated from tier one to tier two who tell me they have the authority to order a replacement. However they dont because the Engineers have the authority. Weird. We went to a Genius Bar ... they told us there ws nothing wrong, but we were very determined.  The replacement phone lasts 5 to 6 times as long as the old one. Still Apple refuse to believe there was anything wrong with the old phone. In fact they were rude to very end suggesting I would be back within a week complaining about the new phone!!  Their diagnostics are like the emissions tests on the VW cars, designed to show it is OK.  Looks like the apple is rotten to the core.",US

Why is it that customers are not told when there are updates and their phone stopped working with products from the App Store when, if only the customers could be told that their phones need updating, there would be no problem? You reach out to customer support at Apple, they give you bad information and you end up with an inferior product because they employ people who they do not train and who are ignorant costing us business customers in conscionable amounts of money.

Now my review: In terms of design, iOS 15 is almost the same as iOS 11, except for the widgets and the app library. iPhones also didn‚Äòt change much in terms of design. I‚Äôm disappointed of the next iOS update, iOS 16. The biggest feature of this update is only changes in the lock screen, that‚Äòs it. Any other features are small and are not required for me. If I compare iOS 16 with Android 13, I honestly need to say that Android 13 is better than iOS 16. Android 13 has new design options like the Material You. It also has improvements in privacy and in the permission manager. iOS 16 is just about the lock screen, it doesn‚Äôt have any design changes or useful features at all. The switch to iPhone  didn‚Äòt meet my expectations. I hope that Google will release their Pixel 7 series as soon as possible, because I am seriously thinking to switch to Android (stock Android this time) again.",DE

It seemed like it had a hard drive failure and the apple operator made an appointment for me to take it into their Apple authorized reseller store Simply Mac at the Avenues in Marrietta, GA.  It was supposed to take 3 to 4 days to diagnose the problem then let me know what the repair would entail.  I tried to call the store on June 10th to get an update, but I got a recording that they were busy and to leave a message.  The same thing happened on June 11th so I drove to the store that day.  It turns out that the Simply Mac store had gone out of business and June 9th and no one called me to notify me to pick up my computer.  The rental office of the mall could not open the shop for me to retrieve my computer because the Simply Mac had filed for bankruptcy and it was in litigation.  The rental office gave me the number of the bankruptcy attorney in Salt Lake City.  I called him and he tried to help but said he was being ghosted by Apple and the landlord.  I have made repeated calls to Apple support since June 11th and they could only say that I should wait for an email from Apple.  I kept calling Apple, the mall rental office  and the attorney every two weeks because I nevery received an update regarding my iMac.   I finally I received a call from Apple support today August 24th, 2022 telling me that the representative/partner who emptied the store cannot locate my computer.  So basically, my computer has been stolen from a store that was recommended to me by Apple Support.  The apple agent who emptied the store, will not return my calls or answer my emails. I was advised to contact Simply Mac attorney and file a claim. Attorney sent forms but mentioned that I may never be compensated or if I did it may be years.  How ridiculous is that?  I believe this warrants a call to All local news stations. I filed a police report for stolen computer.",US

I suggested they simply send a new ipad while they track the one they lost?  I think my only recourse is small claims court.  On friday i ordered products from Hughes and John Lewis.  I was fully informed and everything arrived on time overnight.  Apple its not this hard??? Just found an Apple customer feed back website.  Its for moaning customers.  Apple do not actually look at it by the looks of it? Update:  Its now two weeks after delivery.   Despite hours on the phone Apple have not: 1. Called me to explain why they have not delivered the ipad 2. Delivered the Ipad 3 Found the Ipad 4 Refunded oayment 5 Answered my calls 6 i did get through and they claimed to open an investigation.  Nothing Truely shocking I bought my son an ipad pro and pencil.  I have an invoice from apple via email.  But no ipad? Apple use DPD to deliver.  Bad idea.  So i called DPD multiple times.  Rudeness but no help.  So I called apple numerpus times. First call (over an hour long) the lady called DPD and determined they had no idea where they had delivered to?  She promised an ‚Äú Apple investigative complaint‚Äù was underway, that DPD would contact me and so would apple -all by yesterday.  Nothing.   So I spent 2 hours today being passed around by apple reps.  Noone wants to help.  They cant identify my order - even from their Apple customer/order/referece numbers on my apple invoice. I  cant email, they wont send transcripts of our recorded conversation, wont send sny record of our conversations and of course cant find or deliver my ipad.  They have of course kept my money.   Its dreadful.  Why wrap the apple pencil in a ‚Äúcustomer experience‚Äù but not deliver the ipad.  What to do?  They dont have email.  They control phone access.  Theyvteain staff as a Firewall.   I can only write to Apple with a hand written letter, or Small Claims petition, or fill in an Apple prewritten set of pointless complaint ‚Äúoptions‚Äù - none relevant.

But I had no time to wait bcs of my holiday I should go. So I came with the solution, I go now by car 1 hour go and 1 hour return to Amsterdam Apple store and grab it there. No that was not possible, I can go to the Apple store but should paid that one too, and the other one I needed to wait till the research it was done and after that I shoul get money back. I went to the apple store and bought the 13, now I was just on time to go on holiday. In the meanwhile I got per post the paper cover to put my old Iphone in and send it to swap in.  The employee from apple. com/ nl told me I should cancel my order and than I got automatically my money back, so I did do. When I was on holiday I received an email that the swap in should be canceled, if the Iphone 11 was already at the location it should be send back.  I called again to say that they can keep and i want the money for the swap in 290 euro.  No it goes by an external company, likewize. They couldnt call or email them because they have no phone number and not even an email program, are they lying or is this a strange community? Never met administration people without an emailadress..... So I should take contact and arrange everything by myself. After I came home from holiday the iphone 11 were sended back indeed. The good thing was I got the money back from the Iphone 13 i ordered. But now I had an Iphone 11 and I dont want to sell it at internet, that was the reason I did choose the swapp in/ trade in from apple. Now the woman told me that the apple store said things what was not true and appologize many times, I told her to search a solution and not think following the script, but I only hear her talking like a robot, and ask for a big discount than, the next time I buy I can get a small present, like a cable or Iphone cover.... they really dont listen, I asked to discus with her manager.... not possible.  Online because I was 2 weeks later back from holiday my phone was now worth 270, 25 euro less, and they even dont want to pay for it. While the whole mistake is from apple.  25 euro is offcourse for them nothing. For me its a principe to, what a way how you treat your customers... The whole conversation was really bad, I feel like in a factory, like a number, not a client. They should do this: Sorry sir, ok here is a voucher for 25 euro, show me or prove that your iphone is less worth now and you get it. You can spend it on apple products.  Than I said I want to complain about this customer service. She told me its only possible by sending a letter to apple in Ireland.... When you pay or when they need money or sell it all goes over internet, ones you complain send a letter to Ireland.... this is the way how they work... to build a wall and hope nobody will do. Why not: complaints at apple.com?  They need to change their whole attitude!  I got more angry and angry while the talk goes further.  I didnt want to send a review. because I never do and dont want to waste my time. But at the moment Im still busy to sell my iphone 11 by the company Likewize what they send. Im afraid I need to go to the apple store again..... so much time wasting and loosed only because the **** customerservice from apple and all their internall rules, reallly not helpfull!! Think out of the box and with the client! Not only about your own profit and trust people!",NL

525,www.apple.com,2022-07-31T15:23:31.000Z,1,This is a testimony to how I was‚Ä¶,"This is a testimony to how I was treated by Apple Support Portugal. Around 2018 I purchased a Macbook Pro 15 via Amazon and before the one year mark was up, I decided to purchase Apple Care + (3 extra years of support) just in case. When I received my invoice, though, I noticed the support date ended two years from the purchase date - not the 3 years I had been told via phone. This was when my ordeal began. I went to the support site and tried calling them, and after waiting for several minutes and the call not being picked up, it got disconnected. Strangely enough, when my intention was to make a purchase, customer support not only answered my calls immediately, but they even called me back within 5 minutes. I scheduled a support call (mind you, this was right after the purchase) and on my chosen date, I got no call. Fast forward a few months and numerous attempts to contact support again, and I still had no luck. One year later, after many failed calls and being blatantly ignored (scheduled calls, attempted calls from my part) I decided to contact US support. I got an immediate reply via chat, however, wrong country, so no one could answer why my Apple Care + was 2 years instead of 3. Great. On 2021, the 2 year extra support ends and lo and behold, my touchbar decides to stop working. After a few more attempts to contact or being contacted by Apple Portugal, I contact US support and a few troubleshooting steps later, the technician concludes with 100% certainty that my touchbar has to be replaced... Not only that, but since the replacement is out of warranty, it would cost me $1475 because the whole upper part of my latop had to be replaced - much like the keyboard replacement program. Again: my ""not 3 year"" Apple Care+ had just ended, like, 20 days prior to this. Murphy's Law at its best... I ask if I can send it to be repaired under the keyboard replacement program, but no ""the device has to have proven keyboard issues to be repaired under that program"", which made me seriously consider shoving dirt under the keys just to cause an issue with the keyboard and have it repaired for free. At this point, I'm basically being punished for not having keyboard issues. However, once again, US service cannot help me any further because again: wrong country. I decide to live with a broken touchbar. It still worked, I just couldn't see half of it and had to pretty much guess what I was pressing. I wasn't going to invest 1500 bucks on a 2500 computer that I was still paying (loan). This was last month: I decided to reset the Macbook and upgrade it to Monterey and the touchbar issue resolved itself. Thank you Apple for the $1500 quote on a software issue. And thank you Apple Portugal for simply ignoring my existence (I have process numbers and proof of everything that happened). Anyway I hope my experience helps anyone who had/has issues with Apple, and particularly tech issues the touchbar on the A1990 2018 Macbook Pro and was told it would need to be repaired. Also it should serve as an eye-opener to Apple so they address the huge customer service problem here in Portugal. PS - I tried making a formal complaint in Apple forums and here's their reply, after removing my post. Apparently censorship and silencing customers who have issues is considered good business practice: ""We removed your post Awful customer support in Portugal - Issue with touchbar because it contained rants or complaints that weren‚Äôt constructive. We understand wanting to share experiences, but these forums are meant for technical questions that can be answered by the community."" I personally believe a non working touchbar that started working after an update qualifies as a tech problem... But it also means less money for Apple, right? So let's pretend that it's an hardware issue and charge people 1500 bucks for a replacement that doesn't solve anything. And by the way, let's not let anyone be made aware that it's a software issue... Never again...",PT

It was in stock and it was supposed to be delivered on the following day, Friday, July 22. UPS picked it up from Apple in Chicago on Friday at 9:22 AM. We live in downtown Chicago. You'd think it would be an easy delivery, no? Well, you'd be wrong.  We didn't get it on Friday. Apple did collect the $923.56 from my wife on Saturday. But we didn't get the phone on Saturday or Sunday either.  On Monday July 25 I checked our order status at the Apple Store online. It said: ""Shipment on hold. There is an issue with your delivery and the carrier is unable to deliver your package. Please contact us at 1-800-MY-APPLE."" Come again??? We live in downtown Chicago, about 1.4 miles from the Michigan Avenue Apple Store. We get deliveries from UPS all the time. There's a doorman in our lobby twenty-four hours seven days a week. But UPS is unable to deliver our package? That's very interesting. What happened? We'd love to know more. We checked the UPS website. They had updated their tracking information. It said they'd deliver the package by 7:00 PM that evening. We waited till past 7:00 PM. They didn't. We called Apple. There was a nice lady who looked into it for us. She took a lot of notes. She said they had no idea what was going on. They would start an investigation. But we should call UPS, too. We called UPS. It took about twenty minutes before we managed to get past the automatic dragon lady who won't let you talk to a human being unless you have a magic key. We spoke to a nice lady who looked into it for us. She said they couldn't tell us anything. We weren't the shipper. They can only talk to the shipper. We should ask Apple to start an investigation. We told her we already had. She said we should be patient.  On Tuesday July 26 we called Apple again. We spoke to a nice man. He looked into it for us. He read all of the notes and took some more notes. He said he saw the problem. But he had no updates. We should be  patient. They have a process. It needs to run its course. We would hear from them no later than two days after they started the investigation. We didn't.  Today it's Thursday July 28, a week since we placed the order, six days since it was shipped, five days since our money was collected. We still haven't heard from Apple. But UPS did update their tracking information a while ago. It says that ""the delivery date will be provided as soon as possible."" Apparently it wasn't possible on Tuesday. It wasn't possible on Wednesday either. Apparently it's still not possible today.  Can you believe it? We paid more than $900 for an Apple iPhone that was supposed to arrive six days ago. It must be somewhere in Chicago don't you think? But where? When will we get it? Apple isn't able to locate it? Can't track it with some global-corporate equivalent of the ""FindMy"" app technology that works so well to track my son and my wife? UPS can't locate it either? Somebody doesn't know how to scan a bar code? The dog ate the paper? The driver got sick? ""It fell off the truck""?  I guess it serves us right for trusting Apple and UPS that $923.56 would be enough to make them do their job. We should have walked to the Apple Store and picked it up in person. It's only half an hour walk away. But we got Covid ten days ago. We're still recovering. We ought to be patient. So we're whiling away our time on the web and on the phone. We ought to get paid for this! It's hard work. Like I said: FUBAR! P.S. In case anybody cares: I bought my first Mac in 1985. Or was it 1984?

Despite having another product on the shelf, I would have to wait for my replacement product to be delivered to the store - and to make another visit. It just didn‚Äôt make sense. Notified some days later of my item bring ready for collection, I returned to the store and completed the exchange. What the store failed to tell me was that inside the sealed box was only a replacement charger. Had they have told me, I would‚Äôve kept my USB-C cable and instruction manual. But since they didn‚Äôt tell me and this wasn‚Äôt realised until I got home, I again had to reach out to Apple. Initially using the text chat facility, I was told I would need to make an appointment to be contacted by phone. Really?! That call achieved little. The member of staff didn‚Äôt grasp the problem and simply transferred my call - cold - to my local store. Needless to say, it meant ANOTHER visit to the Apple store.

It still ‚Äúworked‚Äù: I would get notifications and alarms, etc. - but there was no display at all. I took it to the local Apple Store where the tech verified my issue, went through the steps to turn off the Activation Lock, then sent it in to Apple Repair. Apple Repair sent it back without even looking at it because they said the Activation Lock was still enabled - but didn‚Äôt tell me how to disable it or what to do with it after I did! I called support and the tech walked me through the exact same steps I‚Äôd already done at the Apple Store then was at a loss and had to escalate it to a senior tech. 35 minutes later I finally got the Activation Lock removed. Mind you, it was all done on my phone so my watch didn‚Äôt need to be returned to me except as punishment! I sent the watch back for repair and was told there was a puncture in my microphone mesh which voided my warranty so I‚Äôd have to pay $399.00 to fix it.  I said I don‚Äôt know how the microphone was damaged but that had nothing to do with my display not working so could they just fix that??  Nope.  The ‚Äúaccidental damage‚Äù to the microphone voided the warranty so it was $399.00 or nothing would be done.  I refused to pay another $400 for a watch that cost $600 originally and was less than a year old - so they sent it back to me broken. I tried taking it to a 3rd party retailer for repair but they said they‚Äôd have to send it to the same Apple warehouse for repair‚Ä¶ and in fact, now that I‚Äôd turned down their original offer, it‚Äôd cost an additional $100 for a ‚Äúdiagnostic fee‚Äù and it‚Äôd be $499.  Wow.  My lifestyle is not one that‚Äôd cause ‚Äúaccidental damage‚Äù to an internal piece so I believe it was a trick to claim my warranty was voided and be able to charge me for repairs on a faulty device.",US

Well that sucks, but that can happen, at least I'm covered by mac care since it's been lest than a year, right ?  I talked to the support, they told me that I'm covered and just have to send it back for repair.... I'm gonna have to do without my work laptop for a while but so be it... at least I won't have to pay for it... 5 days after;.. I receive a notification : there's another issue with the laptop. Apparently there's now an issue with the case of the laptop in one corner. It's ""internal"" so I've never noticed it (how convenient) but I never had any problem other than the speaker issue... So now they give me 2 choices : pay for everything for 255 euros + taxes !!!! or send it back unrepaired... I call the assistance and ask them to just fix the issue covered by mac care but guess what they ""can't"" do it!! You only have the choice to pay and have everything fixed, or to get it back with nothing done... Do you see the brilliance of the scam ? Basically mac care ""covers"" you, but they only have to find any imaginary issue and now they can strongarm you into paying a ridiculous fee to fix ""everything"".  You can ask them all that you want to fix only the covered issue, they won't do it because ""it's how it's always been"".  Sure officially the first repair is done free of charges, but since the second one price is insane (255 euros because there's a small hole internally"", lol).. Honestly I don't even know what to say, the ""customer care"" of Apple is just a myth, this company will suck you out of your money at every corner, avoid at all cost!!",ES

Alas our 2016 and 2017 macbook pro‚Äôs have had problems with the keyboard from the start as they all had because of an inferior design. And now one has the screen black out problem these models also all have, a design flaw as well, widely discussed on the net. Instead of Apple being the Apple I used to know, recognize the issue being a design flaw and deal with it as they used to (giving the best service by fixing it without hesitation and with that having the best consumer relation ever), today Apple did not live up to the quality I think I pay for when choosing premium products with price tags alike. When I brought it in for service since it is a design flaw the costs were all politely played back to me anyway. Approximately 500 euro without a blink.  My first deeply disappointing experience with what once was an ultra premium quality brand with even better service. Now I felt left in the cold without any service with inferior products with premium price tags. It makes me really sad. What happened to ‚Äúmy‚Äù Apple‚Ä¶??? Fred Woerden Amsterdam",NL

As all my data was transferred from my old iPhone and I chose dark mode to protect my eyes, I did not notice there is a faulty pixel on my iPhone 13pro at the top left corner. It‚Äôs very difficult to notice because of the black margin of Apple screen.

I would not like to leave my phone cuz I will have no phone to use and I will have to drive back to get it, and the technician guy said they might only change the screen after open and check the phone. My iPhone is working well and brand new condition but with a small faulty black pixel on, I do not need more damage to the phone merely because it has a faulty pixel. So I called Apple service again to tell them the issue and ask for direct replacement because I did nothing wrong for this faulty product from them. They admit this faulty pixel might caused by the faulty hardware, or it might be caused by the software. Neither of the reasons was my fault, but according to their terms if I purchased an Apple product, I need to suffer all these troubles their faulty product caused. They will not replace it if I do not drive to the service store several time and let them open my iphone so them can find out what caused the faulty pixel even if I did not misuse. Apple causes so many troubles for customers to give up seeking for their right to get a good product in warranty time. I do not wanna to risk to get a broken phone after I got a faulty product.

If I would have been told all this upfront that this logic board issue was unsolveable,  I could have processed my insurance claim, had my replace phone early, and Apple would still have a loyal customer.

I bought the iPhone 13 pro max because I like to study and work on the go and also watch a lot of entertainment and read while travelling; but I don‚Äôt always like the faff of the larger screened iPads, as great as they are, I like to just pop my device in and out of my pocket as I need it. The pro max is almost like a little iPad, it‚Äôs got decent enough screen estate to do most work stuff and it‚Äôs great for watching movies or streaming your favourite series (the aspect ratio and proportions of the screen is much better than Samsung as there is better width, so better portrait immersion as well as in landscape, other phones like Samsung seem to favour a weird narrow style), and the sound quality from the speakers is wonderful IMO. The quality of engineering in this device is simply brilliant. The user experience is seamless and intuitive which is exactly what I like, all your services are integrated in the Apple ecosystem, but you can access other services if you want.  It‚Äôs got the power, the versatility to be a lot of things and it feels very premium, even with the MagSafe case it looks and feels amazing. I don‚Äôt often get excited about using a device but it‚Äôs a genuine enjoyment to use the 13 pro max on a day to day basis. Great job Apple, keep up the good work!",GB

Tried to log on to the Apple system but as I did not remember my password or old phone number it was impossible. I gave up after much frustration. I will say my Ipad is excellent more six years on the battery holds its charge for months. Recently I purchased two reconditioned ipods to listen to Audible books. Audible decided to close their Windows app that worked with the iPod. The replacement turns out to only work with the latest iPod. This was a fact I discovered after four hours of trying to sort out my password only to have to get a new account with a new email address. Then I had to fill in a lengthy form on the iPod's tiny screen and the keypad designed for the finger size of a three year old.

Right before the phone stopped working I got an error message that the face ID was no longer working. After doing some research myself I found out that if the face id camera gets water damaged it can cause a shortage to the logic board causing the phone not to turn on. I went an hour away to an apple store near me and I told them exactly what I stated above and his response was that they dont have any way to open it up and its most likely that the logic board is fried and the phone wont start up meanin that I would need to either spend 600 on a replacement or double that on a new phone. My main issue here was that I had not backed up my phone so there was important data on there that I needed and he told me my only other option would be to send it out to california and potentially be charged up to FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS to save my data... because the company is reputable lol. I made the right choice to take matters into my own hands and youtube how to remove the face id component. After weeks of waiting for the right tools to open the phone because they make it near impossible to do so for this exact reason, I come to find that I am correct, I unplug the face ID and my phone comes back to life. This company is pure evil and the definition of greed. Sadly so many people wont know or would be scared to try and figure it out on their own and they lose important data because of how greedy these people are.

The insanity enters at this point.   In order to reset these security questions, they asked me to answer one of them again!! I still couldn't answer so that was that. Catch 22. Who in their right mind asks a question that has already been proven unanswerable in order to change that same question??

The support guy was very patient but he couldn't fix it and he wants to call me again next week to try once more. Neither he nor I are confident. The problem appears insurmountable which means that when my old email address is switched off, all the apps I bought with it will need to be downloaded or purchased again. The issue is that all the configurations, progress and additions made to these apps will be gone. It's fu***** madness! Every other account I have updated where this kind of issue arose was fixable because the company concerned sent an email with a link in it that I could use to reset the login/password/security question/whatever. Apple however are fanatical fundamentalists who consider that if you cannot answer a fifteen year old question then you are not who you say you are. End of story. Nothing more to be said or done.

I posted the phone off and when they received it, they refused to fix it, citing the reason was that it had 'been opened before and therefore the warranty was void'. i responded and indicated it was them that carried out the previous warranty repair and could back this up with receipts etc but i also knew they would have their own records of this. Anyway, several back and forwards later and they said the screws on the bottom of the phone were marked and that their support staff would never have left them like that. i said the phone hadnt been anywhere else but that maybe the bumper case had caused some wear along the bottom.

Because apple decided to do an automatic update while I was asleep and I ‚Äúshould have backed it up before updating it‚Äù like I knew it was going to update and should have expected apple to just go through and delete tons of photos.  On another note, their products are trash I got the iphone 12 new and within 2 months it was running slowly and glitching out but ‚Äúthey couldn‚Äôt see a problem with it‚Äù so warranty didn‚Äôt cover it.

Instead of the special edition specially chosen colour, I got black headphones. Not even like for like. Customers pay the very high price and choose specisl colours for a reason. When there is a manufacturing defect on your part, you give extra care to the customer. Not use some small print to treat them poorly and without any consideration. This time again, there is a manufacturing defect with the BEATS buds bought three months ago. Instead of replacing them in the store, they have to be sent to the repair shop. It will take 4 weeks apparently. I am sure, considering the defect, I will get refurbished buds and god only knows what colour. I will put it into perspective with previous experiences with other budinesses. When i had sn issue withJOHN LEWIS product, the customer service immediately replaced the product after an apology.

Once I submitted the claim online, I called customer services to ensure I'd done everything right and that it had been submitted properly. They were extremely helpful and I received my new phone two days later. I would definitely recommend investing in the Applecare Theft/loss package especially if you live anywhere in or like London.

724,www.apple.com,2022-04-30T08:43:12.000Z,5,30 year journey loaded with Apple goodness,"About 12 years ago, I started using Apple phones with the 3gs iPhone. I buy a new iPhone almost every year, but each phone provides 3-4 years of service as my wife and children use 'hand me downs' when I change.  Yes, an annual iPhone shuffle! :)  During these 12 years, I've used over ten different iPhones, and NOT ONE has presented a problem that Apple didn't promptly resolve.  Most never had any issue.  I've sometimes wondered if the extended warranty has been necessary, but I think it is worthwhile for the duration we use them!   I've also purchased an iMac, Macbook Pro, AirPods, iPad, AirPod Pro, and other devices.  It hasn't been all smooth sailing across all these devices, but on the rare occasion I've faced issues, Apple has always taken pride in resolving them to my satisfaction. I'm pragmatic and believe problems and electronics are inevitable.  What matters to me is the frequency and how they resolve issues when they do arise.  In that regard, Apple set the standard for consumer electronics. I recently had an event where I inquired about an out-of-warranty device issue. Apple support engaged me comprehensively and ultimately replaced the item FOC (Free Of Charge) as it ""Didn't meet their standards"".  I went to their service centre expecting to spend and came away with a free replacement.  That only comes from an organisation that will stand by its products. I started as an Apple II computer user in the late '80s and, after a lengthy break, joined their Mac world in 2012.  Since then, I've enjoyed the Apple echo system, which prioritises my needs and privacy.  I consider alternatives occasionally, but I currently see no serious contender.  Ease of use, reliability, longevity and delivering a complete package is all part of the reasoning behind my conclusion. If you consider Apple's pricing versus what they deliver holistically, I believe they are not the most costly.  It can be hard to differentiate purchase price from cost over a device's life, but you will not be disappointed when you can take that step!",SG

The delivery timetable was clear on the Apple Store site -- I would have to wait longer because I was ordering the computer with the larger screen. Apart from choosing the model w/a 16"" screen, everything else about my order was standard. Nevertheless, Apple has apparently chosen not to stock these machines in its stores -- instead, the company with a larger market capitalisation than ANY OTHER COMPANY ON THE PLANET has opted for the 'just-in-time' supply chain strategy favoured by most other large multinationals. That's all fine, so long as customer needs and expectations are managed proactively by Apple.  But here, they have failed completely -- I was told at the time I placed my order that I should expect to wait roughly 8 weeks for delivery. This was irritating and put pressure on me to keep my ailing, 7-year-old MacBook Pro operational, but I was informed of the timetable for delivery BEFORE I placed my order, so at least I could make an informed decision. Now, however, Apple is apparently having supply chain problems.  Two weeks ago, they confirmed I could expect delivery this week (w/c 25th April); today, I received an update announcing the new deliery window is now between 14-27th JUNE). The unfortunate customer service reps I spoke with after receiving this unwelcome news had nothing useful to tell me, other than the usual scripted acknowledgements of my frustration and apologies for inconvenience. Sorry, Apple -- THIS IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH. Perhaps consider dedicating a tiny fraction of your insane market cap to establishing a more diversified supply chain, given there's no end in sight to the factors we can all presume will continue to disrupt manufacturing for the foreseeable future. I look forward to the day when another disruptor comes along and finally deposes Apple as the only useful non-Windows/Android option.",GB

The App Review Team and App Review Board have been consistently rejecting my app, the reason being: ""Guideline 4.3 - Design We continue to find that your app provides the same feature set as other apps submitted to the App Store; it simply varies in content or language, which is considered a form of spam."" This is 100% false because my app has unique features not found on other apps on the App Store. My app does comply with the App Store Review Guidelines because it offers unique, high quality features not found on other apps. Based on their definition of 4.3.0, their claim of my app violating 4.3.0 is false and not valid. The strange part is that the supposedly similar apps don't offer the features that my app offers, yet those apps are able to get their app submissions approved (April 2022). I should also mention that those apps were published after mine. I have already notified them about this. I have provided screenshots, video demos, source code, spoken to the App Review team and the App Review Board, filed numerous appeals and they are still rejecting the app because of 4.3.0. They appear to be ignoring the information I've been providing and are responding to me with generic responses. At this time, as I have exhausted all options, I've filed a complaint with the BBB and have consulted a lawyer to look at this case. Based on our initial investigation, it is evident that there is anti-competitive practices, selective bias, and unfair treatment going on in the App Store.

One time, they told me that my Macbook had water damage so they could not retrieve my data for me since it was ‚Äúall rusted‚Äù. This was BS because my friend was able to recover everything for me weeks later. I‚Äôve had other poor customer service experiences with them, but let‚Äôs talk about the one from today. Apple had a recall / product defect with their Macbook pro where the keyboard double types letters. I was not even notified about this that I know of, and if I was there was definitely no ‚Äòdeadline‚Äô mentioned. I only found out through my friend.  In the past year, I visited apple store multiple times to get this addressed, making appointments. Once, I even started a conversation online and she helped me make the Genius Bar appointment. Each time, the Genius Bar was delayed to the point that I waited 30+ minutes at the Genius bar and then had to go home or back to work. None of these visits were logged by Apple. Maybe because I never got to talk to a ‚Äúgenius‚Äù since they were all busy.  Today, I went to the Apple store, finally made it to the Genius specialist, and they said they can‚Äôt fix my keyboard because the 4 year warranty passed 2 months ago. They saw no logs of me coming to the apple store to fix this, and said I have to contact support over the phone since they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have the power to make an exception‚Äù. Phone specialist says they have to back up the store specialists, and that they have no record of me trying to fix this before Feb 25. Phone specialist also said the in store specialist DO have the power to make exceptions, and that the log shows ‚Äúexception denied‚Äù. So they managed to log this, but not the numerous times I talked to Apple? And they lied about not ‚Äúhaving the authority to make this decision‚Äù lol. Are you kidding me?

But I can't turn off the fingerprint lock garbage. I try adding her as a family member sharing. It makes her go get an apple id using a credit card and everything just to not let her join because the process is so convoluted that it literally brakes. It sends her an email invite that can only be opened on an apple device, and ONLY using their proprietary email app. Then, it pops up and asks to click on the invitation - but there aren't any. So we both just wasted 30 minutes, my wife had to get an apple id and jump through all these hoops just to not have their stupid family sharing garbage work. Why lock a device I purchased. It is MY PROPERTY after I buy it. Apple acts like their tech is their property after they sell it to you at over inflated prices. So, I get on the line with support.

795,www.apple.com,2022-03-20T17:45:27.000Z,1,Apple Cheating!,"Apple Cheating! I would like to share my last experience with Apple. It is my first time buying something from Apple. I decided to buy IPhone 13 Pro Max. Basically, the phone's display just got dead after 2 weeks of purchasing the phone from Apple directly. I was on the way from Manchester to London. While I was on the train, the display just died. I could not use touchscreen obviously, but by luck I was able to speak to siri to call my friend and show me the ways in London. I was literally lost there at night. The next day, I went to Apple store in Westfield/Stratford where I got the most disgusting customer service experience from the team there who was just trying to dismiss the case! She was not even knowing how to disable find my phone while she calls her self as technician! She wanted to close the case by saying ""Sorry this cant be fixed and we cant help you"" It is totally not acceptable to have a phone repaired within two weeks without getting a replacement sealed in a box! totally unfair! Despite the lack of skills, she was rude! I advised her to speak with a senior as there must be a way to disable that! she went to speak with a senior after agurments with me! The senior taught her how to do that. She could just do that immediately without working on my nerves! I reported the case to her manager, it turned out he is another smug corrupted person, to the extend that he told me ""Do not try with me by reporting my staff member, we are not going to give you replacement! We are going to replace the screen and if it wont work then we will think about replacement"" I spent like ~5 hours in there. 1. Arrived the store, got a appointment after 2 hours 2. During the first appointment, troubleshooting and figuring out how to disable find my phone, by that person who calls herself a technician. 3. The phone transfered to maintenance team, gave me another appointment to come back after 2 hours, came back again after 2 hours, they said we have technical issues, come back again after 15 minutes, and then another 15 minutes. 4. Last report by them that the screen cant be fixed and the phone has to be replaced. I was happy that they decied to replace it. 5. Awaited for another 30 minutes to get the replacement and BOOM I got a phone that is wrapped in cheap nylon! I asked is that referbushed? They told me that this is a recycled phone like a new! I was just wondering how soon they got to recycle within 6 months of releasing that phone! I said but ""I should get something sealed in the box! It is only 2 weeks, this is a manfucaturing defect and a fault from Apple! They refused to gave me a sealed new device in the box and gave me a paper to sign it by IPad, I read that paper, it is just confirming that they replaced the phone without mentioning anything about the condition of the replacement. I said I will take this as temporary solution until I get back to my home in Manchester because I am literally lost her without phone. Later, I got an email from Apple stating that the replacement phone is referbushed and that the value of it is 460 GBP! I gave them a call and the case took like 2 weeks speaking with them and the managaement over the phone, repeating the case everyday to every apple staff member! Either they tell me we are differnt than the physical stores in the street and we can only help with online purchases or they tell me that you AKNOWLEDGED that the phone is referbushed based the Email I got from Apple, it states that I aknoweledged that the replacement is referbushed, though there is no signature from my side! Here comes the evidence of their cheating. The doc I got in the store states nothing related to the condition of the replacement (New or referebushed), and it has been signed by me. The Email I got from Apple states that the replacement is referbushed. They refused to replace my phone with new one because they considered me that I aknoweldged (Which has been done by cheating by hiding the fact it is referbushed) Basically, these phones that they replace, they will just repair them later and use them as replacement for other customers! There is nothing called recycling for these phones it is just a lie, it is referebushed device and they hide the fact it is referbushed until you get an Email stating that the device is referbushed because there could be a rejection from a customer to accept the phone in store thus they will be forced to issue a refund or sealed new phone as replacement in that case Everytime I ask them to issue the refund, they tell me but you aknoweledged the phone is referbushed! This explains that there is such a case where customers just refuse the replacement. I did not know about that fact and thats how they got the chance to cheat. Apple is being managed by smug people who consider themselves as on demand nowdays thus they dont care about their customers at all in addition to the cheating.",GB

Spent 1K on an order of 2 items; they split up the order without advance notification, so you are chained to an at-home delivery AND a car trip to the store. They don't allow you to combine the two in one delivery. Of course not. They are expedite and super efficient at removing the cash from your account; then the agony begins. Tranche of bonkers nonsensical emails that contain gobbledygook force you to spend time noone has on procuring contact via live chat/calls. (eg of an email - subject header implies the email is re the ipad air delivery, yet content is a load of ill spaced out, oddly random text that seems to be about the other part of the order) - and it looks like a 3 year old has gotten onto mum's computer and pressed send after jiggling around with the content, five times. Randomly plonking bits of text here and there. No joining up and no salient relevance to the order details you're seeking. Desperately seeking by now as it's day 3 after order placement and still no clue as to when and WHAT TIME the order is arriving at the home address. Hour of life spent on live chat nets varying reports re delivery details (which are missing  even up to and including the day before the delivery) - and still no clue as to the time. One girl on live chat (16.3.22- circa 6pm) suggests  - why of course I can pick one of the hourly time slots when they land in advance of the day of delivery - yet when STILL nothing has landed the day before (today) - I force myself to call in to speak to a human and find out what on earth is going on with the chaos, mess and totally at expense of the customer's sanity. Not to mention working hours drained away.... The next call nets the total opposite - yes, wait for it - the brand Apple sees fit to re introduce 50's style housewife expectations; you WILL SIT INDOORS ALL DAY, MRS, WAITING FOR ME. Apparently it's me asking a bit much - not to have to give up 8am - 8pm on a work day - because...this...is....Apple....this is how we roll. You wait on us beatch. I'm supposed to feel better about giving up 12 hours waiting on these amoral greedsters - because  - wait for it - they will tell me the hour they will deliver in. ON THE DAY! MORNING OF! Ok bye bye any plans any meetings anything at all for the whole day from 8-8pm as I won't know until tomorrow morning when the delivery will come. Yay. 2022. Hello. When even arcane old school risible brands like British Gas having to step into modern day living - and not demand customers sit in all day waiting on their arrival - this blows Apple off the stratosphere of oxymoronic; a so called TECH company - branding itself as er progressive and forward thinking - now expects us to sit in all day - waiting on them....Yikes. Reality check so big needed that it doesn't exist. Couldn't make it up. Apple - a brand that sunk the amoral abyss of capitalism gone so horribly wrong - even lower. They don't care you've spent your time, your money, your sanity, your everything on days trying to work out what on god's earth is going on with their chaotic and ridiculous delivery system (they don't have one; they are so tight they allocate the courier company the night before - they are clearly waiting on the cheapest deals on delivery) - they really couldn't give a damn about the consumer. And their blatant hubris and ****-off attitude shows they're actually quite proud of their lack of any self awareness whatsoever. A so called senior complaints manager actually suggested there was something amiss with my attitude - to raise the subject of 50's style housewife ambitions from Apple's desire for money money money - it's cheaper for them that way of course....But she wants to tell me off for telling the truth; not a comfortable concept - the truth - for Apple. They like to talk down and boy do they go far with that premise that you're the dumbo and tell you off they will, talking over you and threatening to end calls - over - the truth. Have the customer held to ransom while they spend less on efficient and commensurate delivery. She also suggested that the customers' purchasing didn't pay for either staff  nor for Apple's existence.... :) No, sure, the fairy rainbow unicorns pay salaries. The fairy rainbow unicorns are - however - certainly in charge of deliveries - if you chase them for hours, over days..... Hubris beyond belief; of course you're expected to take a day off work, of course you're expected to wait ON US - we are the MIGHTY APPLE. Sit down and shut up little woman - was my lot. By a woman. #shame They employ a company just to deal with complaints. Not entirely convinced it's the right one. My lost working day and hours spent on chasing up the order are - she agrees - worthy of invoicing. 'They won't care' are her final words on the complaint I raise.

The review should (and would) be FIVE STAR, if it wasn't for some of Apple's apparent intransigence. Feedback below given to Apple on a recent interaction. The advisor Kevin was great, friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. The system somewhat less so.  Firstly, the automated system is not fit for purpose in any way shape or form! Considering where we are present day, with voice recognition, your automated system seems rooted somewhere in the late 1980s! It never has any idea what is being requested, which always results in me (and probably many others) just shouting obscenities at it! And then normally ending up at the wrong department, therefore wasting an advisor's time and further frustrating valued customers! Secondly, and even more importantly, I have all my music (a lifetime's music) purchased legitimately, so therefore mine, to do whatever I wish, within the realms of the law, that is now stuck on my iPhone and cannot be transferred back to my very expensive, new, top of the range custom order iMac!!! This is due to my old iMac, just stopping working! There needs to be an easy way to recover data from a malfunctioning Mac and more importantly, Apple need to make available the sort of 3rd party programmes that there are out there, for eventualities such as this! Please listen to your customers! We are personally, Apple aficionados, we have EVERY Apple product there is! We intend to stay Apple customers for ever, but that doesn't mean that we will. How can Apple leave some of their best customers (ie best advertising stream) feeling frustrated and angry? Come on Apple, must do better for the customers that you already have, and then, spend the astronomical budgets attracting others. Word of mouth and customer satisfaction is KING! Perhaps (if you don't already have) create a pool of committed, confirmed Apple users, for genuine feedback, instead of a bunch of highly paid statistic massagers! Who are probably reading these comments. And we all know that turkeys don't vote for Christmas.",GB

After calling back and forth between ups and Apple for 3 days. Someone finally told me that my phone had got lost in transit.. they sent me a new phone, after 6 days. As soon as I receive the phone I noticed that the phone was too small for me so I called them and ask them if I can go in the store and exchange for a different phone. Of which at the time they told me that they couldn't do it. that the only thing they could do is send me a refund. What the representative didn't mention is that I had to wait until after apple received the phone for them to be issue a refund. When the representative sent me the shipping label after reading the shipping label it stated three steps for me to get my refund.1 print the label, 2 take the phone to the UPS, once we receive the phone we will refund you.

I'm writing this for potential new or current Apple customers to shed light on how Apple treats their customers in after-sales, I just feel like it's just the right thing to do. The story: I went to the official Apple store in Berlin to get a screen crack on my #iPhone (I assume the most common issue) repaired. After talking to someone for 15 minutes they kept my phone and told me to come back in 1h and pay the 29‚Ç¨ since I have Apple Care+ for that phone. When I came back, they tell me they discovered some unexpected water damage in the phone (which I assume could have come from showing the QR-code for the Genius bar appointment outside - it was raining and I had a cracked screen after all..). The problem: After the ""repair"" half of the screen of the before-perfectly-working phone now doesn't work anymore, which makes the phone practically unusable. They say I need to replace the complete phone for 99‚Ç¨, which I find disappointing, but am willing to do. However they don't actually have a phone in the store and I should come back in 2-3 days to get and pay for my replacement. So effectively they're telling me: Sorry, but please get lost with a phone that we completely broke and live without a phone for 2-3 days. Obviously this is a problem / impossible in today's world for both work and personal life! So I ask for a replacement phone for the 2-3 days: Nope. I ask whether the other Apple Store in the city (far away) could help me: They cannot say and won't even tell me whether they have a phone in store, but expect me to just go and hope. They refuse to call and ask them, because it's not the policy. I ask to speak to the store manager: They send someone who tries to pretend to be the store manager, who tells me to just accept it. I ask for the real store manager: A women called Ulrike (she refuses to tell me her last name) comes and claims to be the real store manager. I explain the situation and she just says there is nothing she can do (including not connected me with someone higher up, who could solve the problem). At this point I'm actually just very confused and sad. I cannot believe that this is the way Apple treats a customer that has spent ‚Ç¨10k+ on Apple products privately during his life, not even counting using and evangelising their products at work. I actually love Apple products from both a design and product perspective and I also work in tech so I know, or at least hope, that HQ Apple would hate to see their customers be treated this way. I'm honestly just so confused, sad, and disappointed. I still cannot believe what just happened, I'm an business owner myself and I (and I hope every other business owner) would never-ever-ever treat customers this way. The most ironic part: I'm writing this from my (Apple!) MacBook Pro, since my phone doesn't work... Sorry for the long post and thanks for reading. Hope this helps potential future Apple customers know where they stand when they have a problem that doesn't fall into the Apple standard processes. I'm just sad that the most valuable company in the world treats its' customers this way. I guess shareholder value > customer value üò¢",DE

However, I bought Airpod Pros, and these are by far the worst Apple product I have ever used. I took them back to the shop now 4 times, and spent hours on the phone with their tech support. They replaced first one airpod, the the second, then the case, then did firmware updates and still they drop calls, switch between devices when not meant to, and Apple does nothing to truly fix the problem.  I bought the AirPods at an airport shop after my original AirPods stopped holding a charge (they were old, and no complaints, those had worked well for several years). Apple uses this excuse to not stand 100% behind their product. Very poor. When Apple does this, they lose the reason people are willing to pay a premium.

Justin was extremely patient and took great pains to ensure that my queries had been answered, going beyond the call of duty to give me advice as to where I could purchase a new battery in UK for my Apple Iphone.  He carried out a diagnostics test which clarified why my iPhone was not working properly and gave me suggestions and his considered opinion as to what my best course of action should be.  As I am 75-year old pensioner and not very technically-savvy, his guidance was invaluable and he assured me throughout our conversation that he was only doing his job in taking the time and making the effort to solve my problem.  An added bonus was the fact that this lengthy telephone call was free of charge to me.

Although their products were significantly more expensive than other brands, I kept buying iPhone after iPhone and iPad after iPad, plus iWatch and other accessories... Until last year when I got disgusted by their greed.  My last iPad Pro just stopped working after 2 years and 1 month. People were telling me before that they sell products with just the right amount of defects or low-quality parts so they stop working 3 years after they are been bought, but this time this expensive piece of garbage didn't even reach 2 years and a half. Before it shut down forever, it would discharge in about 40 minutes of usage, which completely defeats the purpose of having a mobile device. I had to walk around the office with a changer and prey I found an outlet that's not taken by other Apple users. Same with my last iPhone.  What is the purpose of having a mobile phone if it won't last you at least while you are at the office??? In 2020 I decided that I am not going to give them another chance of ripping me off and I bought a Samsung tablet and phone. I can finally use my mobile devices away from the outlet.  I wonder when people are going to figure out that this company is dead. It makes me think of the frog example. You put a frog in a pot filled with boiling water, it's going to jump out immediately, but if you put the frog in cold water and you start to heat it up progressively, it would die there boiling.

878,www.apple.com,2022-02-03T16:32:49.000Z,1,Won't get fooled again !!,"Won't get fooled again !! The following is my reply to Apple after they asked for 'feedback' following my recent visit to one of their 'genius' bars. I am an ex Apple engineer and I will not waste money on another one of their cynical 'nerd traps' Take my advice there are better , cheaper alternatives to paying double for faulty goods and being slapped in the face if you complain. This is my feedback: ------------------------------------------------------------- After being told I would have to pay something like ¬£10 for a magsafe charger replacement . by one of Jack's colleagues. (One of 4 magsafes I have that were constructed with sub standard cable which has frayed and constitutes a shock hazard) I was then told by XXXX that it would cost ¬£56 to replace the faulty product that Apple sold to me in the first place. I was astounded that a 'replacement' was almost the price of buying a new one. I was an Apple hardware engineer in my past and have owned a new mac desktop or laptop or phone every couple of years since my first SE30 and 3GS phone. I am now changing all of my gear to Android and Linux products because frankly Apple products are overpriced and in my time as a user I have watched (with horror) the way the company has become arrogant and dismissive of it's loyal customers. Other products are available and I will urge anyone in the future to not even consider an Apple item because they are bad value for money and the attitude to customers with problems absolutely stinks. (Before Apple gets on it's high horse about this only being my 'opinion' I would like to remind them that I used to organise spares and replacements in the 90s) -I never signed a non disclosure agreement about their practices so if anyone wants to ask me how cynical their operation is ,- get in touch! Lets get this in perspective, at one point a few years ago I had 2 dead Macbook Pro13""s with faulty graphics that Apple refused to acknowledge as a problem. I also had 2 Ipads that had shut down. Another problem Apple would not acknowledge. Nearly ¬£4000 of equipment that died within 2 years of purchase! The solution apparently was to buy a large amount of Applecare to protect me against the faulty products Apple had sold me. I would respect you more if you supplied a roll of insulating tape with your products as most of your loyal customers have to buy their own. PM",GB

Two weeks ago I visited the Apple Store in Booragoon Perth to have my screen fixed. The screen was fixed in about an hour and the phone was ready at the promised time. I bought and installed a screen protector but then after I got home, realised that I could no longer hear callers unless they were on speaker. So back to the store to have this issue checked After a diagnostic was performed, a faulty speaker was identified and a new screen booked in, same deal as last time, and a new screen protector was going to be added at no cost to me. When I went back to the store at the promised time to collect the phone, it wasn‚Äôt ready and I was directed to a table to wait. This table had no chairs and I waited 30 mins, then found someone to chase up my phone and the phone arrived, all fine and the speaker issue fixed but no screen protector, so this was then done. At all times the Apple team were lovely. BUT at no point did anyone applogise for the inconvenience to me of having to take time out of my day and drive an hour back to the store, nor did they apologise for having me wait 30 mins past my promised pick up time nor did they apologise for not having the screen protector done as promised. I‚Äôm a long time Apple lover, with 20 Apple products at my business but I just felt that an apology or a glass of water while waiting or a regular check in while I was waiting would have gone a long way.

921,www.apple.com,2022-01-15T20:13:26.000Z,1,Apple is the biggest thief in the technology sector with their loopholes. BE AWARE!!!,"My review may sound very frustrating and that is because Apple has designed obvious loopholes in their system to steal from their customers. Here goes my story with them. I financed an Apple 13 pro and I got Apple Care+ with Theft and Loss which should cover your phone if it is lost. While traveling we were put to sleep and robbed at our Airbnb and our phones were stolen. When I tried to log in to my account, my phone was put into something that Apple calls ""Recovery Mode"" and they cut my access from my account for 18 days because people who stole it, tried to get into the phone and for security reasons, Apple put my account on such a long non-sense hold. After the 18 days was over, I logged into my account and my device was not showing under my account. Of course the thieves were not sitting around for me to log in and find their location. They either jalbroke my phone, or they took it into pieces and used the hardware.  Here is Apple's loophole. In order to file a lost phone claim, I have to log into my account and put the phone in ""Lost Mode"" but this is not an option because for no reason my phone had disappeared and does not show on my account. How is that under my control? They are saying that I might have turn the ""Find My Phone"" option off which I never did. The funny fact is that when you turn that off, Apple sends you an email that the option was turned off. I never received that email and Apple knows that because they keep the record of everything in their system. In the end, Apple is telling me to go F*** myself because of their loophole I cant file a claim and the $1200 phone is gone. What is the point of getting insurance? I am switching from Apple after more than 10 years because their customer service and their ethics of business are disgusting. Apple gave 18 days to the thieves to do whatever they want so I have to go back and buy another phone from them. So unfair, so wrong. The fact is that I have insurance and my phone is stolen from me and the insurance has to cover it. Now the way to file is defined by Apple in a way for them to benefit from this. My case simply has to be filed manually because it is an error on Apple's system for not showing my device.",US

Complained to apple that strap was not fit for purpose with description, supplied photos, her appleID so they can see her brand loyalty,  who has been buying their overpriced stuff for 10 yrs if not more. Replied and said there was insufficient evidence to make a claim. Why, as fate would have it, on this occasion we weren't video-recording her wrist walking from A to B. I didn't expect them to replace or offer free or even lower priced repair as a gesture of goodwill but good to confirm and seal the suspicion and disappointment. Why try to redesign the wheel? Have been wearing real watches all my life and never had a strap which failed to keep the watch where it should be, hence this 'design' is not worthy of the name, though maybe that's why they couldn't call it a strap.

But over the past 10 years, the company has turned into a greedy conglomerate. Many would argue they were already a greedy conglomerate, but their latest practices are unforgivable. New iPhones don‚Äôt include a charger, or even a cord. Customers are forced to buy them separately, even though the iPhone cannot work without them. This would be the equivalent of buying an automobile, but having to purchase the gas tank and fuel pump separately. Earbuds disappeared years ago, along with the connector, prompting customers to buy outrageously priced wireless ones. Yet through all the things Apple has removed, their prices continue to skyrocket. The iPad 13 Pro Max sells for an outrageous $1,599. (Plus an additional $58 for that power adapter and charger that aren‚Äôt included.) For over five years, Apple has sold computers with defective, low-quality keyboards. Customers are now realizing that the storage inside them wears out after a few years, and cannot be repaired, at any cost. So Apple‚Äôs claim of being environmentally friendly is utter nonsense. After a few years, today‚Äôs new Mac will be completely worthless. Throw the whole thing away and buy another. Apple‚Äôs products can no longer be modified, upgraded, or repaired. They just wear out, turning into an environmental disaster. The last computer I bought was a used, 2015 model MacBook.

I bought this phone mainly for the camera but have had so many issues with the camera. The phone first started out having focus issues and sound on the video would have issues but went away. The videos will blur out a ton when taking the videos and lose focus half way through taking a video whether I‚Äôm moving or staying still. I thought it was something in the camera settings because people were telling me it will blur out backgrounds and stuff but it would blur everything in the video. When I first got the phone I wasn‚Äôt really using the camera a lot until I went and did something fun where I wanted to take videos and this is where I first noticed the issues. I‚Äôve taken it to T-Mobile and since it was past the 2 weeks they can‚Äôt do anything and I had to go through Apple. Apple had me do some tests where it seemed fine then had me take it to Best Buy for tests but couldn‚Äôt see anything wrong but they could all see it was having issues when I showed them. I also shared my screen where two reps could both see on two separate occasions the blurriness issue as well as turning the camera on but the video and cinematic options are gone. I‚Äôve also had issues with cropping. I think I got a dud phone and all they tell me is to reset network settings and restore phone back to factory settings where I need to delete everything off and then see if it still has the issues.

In the past few months I upgraded my iMac to a 2020 model from a 2014 model, expecting it to be a whiz-bang. It is not. My feeling is that I have not improved my situation one iota. That move cost me ¬£2000. In the past week I upgraded my MacBook Pro from a 2018 model to a 2021 model and I feel the same. I thought  the new M1 chip would be transformational. It is not. There are too many points of dissatisfaction to list them all here, though I would do so if asked. Where has all the speed gone? The security aspects of setting up new hardware are horrendous. Even the once-simple process of migrating has become a nightmare. As an IT professional, I cannot see how ordinary people cope with all this! My MacBook Pro cost me ¬£1800 and the cash back for a trade-in was ¬£240. This is really not worth it. I have had constant issues with the OS - constantly being asked to put in passwords and security codes. This is all SO unsatisfactory.

I called and went thru 3 people. Last thing I was told was that they are processing for a new one to be sent to me and I'd get an email w/details.  Never happened. I called AGAIN on 12/12/21 & spoke to someone who was eating while he was talking and he told me it was being replaced & sent out, a supervisor will call me. I asked when and he said ""today"".

After paying ¬£1200, this is what I get!!! Customer service was very poor as well in Bluewater as shop was packed with people dealing or waiting for repairs! Disgusting!!!

Next morning, I receive a text that my parcel is out for delivery again. I go to the service point, and indeed the parcel is not at the service point and has never been at the service point. I call DHL and the customer support person says he will make sure the parcel is delivered to another service point the same day. The parcel will be there no later than 4:30 PM. Around 6 PM, I still haven't received a text and call DHL again. The (different) customer support person tells me that the parcel won't be delivered until tomorrow as I have asked for an address change, which always causes the package to be delivered no earlier than the next day. Long story short, the parcel is still in transit as DHL can't get this organised. When Apple sends my packages with UPS, I never have any trouble.

1120,www.apple.com,2021-11-10T19:16:12.000Z,1,"Company is not able to give or receive phone calls, but demands them. The company is about 100 years behind the times and is not up to date with modern technologies such as how to use a phone","In attempting to sign up for a simple payment processing service I found that Apple, Inc. seems to be particularly challenged specifically in the fields of telecommunications and technologies.  Matters that seem to be relatively simple and straight forward when dealing with any other business, from a startup small business on up to a Fortune 500 company, are apparently very difficult or impossible for Apple to accomplish. It appears that Apple is not familiar with elements of modern technology, specifically in regards to how to give and receive phone calls or communications over the internet. Of all of the companies I have dealt with for the past decade or so, the company which has shown itself to be the most technically challenged and behind-the-times in the fields of internet technology and telecommunications, is Apple, Inc. Specifically: 1. I signed up online for an Apple developer account, which was the first step to getting a payment processing account. 2. I then received an email stating that the application could not be completed without a phone call.  This is a dated technology (phone communications). Such dated technology is not usually needed by modern corporations familiar with 21st internet technologies used for long distance communications.  Even in the case where a face-to-face meeting is desired for verification purposes, we have numerous methods of accomplishing this which are far more advanced than telephones. 3. Nevertheless, I set aside a time to call Apple, despite recognizing that this company is behind the times. 4. When I attempted to contact Apple, I found that they had other issues.  There is no phone number to call.  The only way to contact them is to go online and submit a request for them to contact me. 5. Despite this outdated technology and hassle, I input my phone number and waited for their call. 6. I attempted this numerous times. On some occasions, my phone rang but when I answered and responded, I heard only silence.  On other occasions, the phone did not ring at all and I then received an email that Apple was ""trying to reach me.""   7. I contacted Apple by email and requested to have their phone number so that I could call them, since they were not able to call me. 8. Apple support then told me that they do not have a phone number to receive calls.  (Another indicator that this company is about 100 years behind modern times: they are demanding a phone call, but have no number.) 9. I again made an appointment for Apple to call me. 10. I arranged my schedule and made myself available for the call.  Again, the same pattern repeated. On some occasions, the phone rang, I picked up and answered, and heard silence.  On other occasions, the phone did not ring at all and I got an email saying ""we're trying to reach you."" 11. I made another appointment.  I gave another number. I waited for the call.  The phone was sitting by me and did not ring.  There was no missed call. I received an email from Apple, stating that they had called and could not get through. I can see that Apple, Inc. is at least a few decades out of date.  It should probably get itself up to speed with modern technologies, such as how to use a telephone, and what internet technology is.  I am able to work with any other business, whether it is a bank or an ice cream shop.  I can give and receive calls and I can sign up for new services online. In the last 10 years or more, the only company I have encountered that is so technically challenged in the fields of Internet Technology and Telecommunications is Apple, Inc.",US

I found that my warranties for my apple care plus will expired in 2022.  First of all, I came to see the first level of staff named Josh with my receives . Unfortunately, I was not allowed to go to the next level of service by Josh. He didn't took a close look at those and made me a surprise; He said my cables are not covered as only devices are covered even he didn‚Äôt reviewed my receives. I said he was wrong and said I bough Apple Care Plus. After a very quick look about 2 seconds he made a decision that my cables are not coved under the plan and consider my cables have physical damages and not asking why and what happened.  As an expert, he already knows the its problem that many user have face about the I phone lighting cable rubber is wear off and corrode after 3 to six months of used. Of course, I am not agree and asked to talk to a supervisor.  After few minutes Janet and Eric came. Once again, Janet made me another surprise as she said the only device is covered and said I purchased the products in 2019 and warranties are expired. I told and show her that I have the Apple Care Plus on my both receives.  Eric and Janet then took a look on my USB C cable for my Mac book only and show the pictures and said it not covered. Even they are not looking and investigate on my lightning cable charger for my I phone even I explained to them that in the past, I came to the store to had replaced my lightning cable charger for my I phone caused the ruble wear off on several places on the cable as same as I have today. I have to covered over it with some tapped for temporary and for safety purpose and wait until the COIVID is ease a little bit. I did that as I‚Äôm concern about the safety reason as it may caused fire or electrical shock while charging it.   I came to the store for same problem for my lightning cable charger for my I phone and my USB C for my Mac. Once again, I‚Äôm not satisfy with the decision and I asked if She or Eric can write a note on the receives the reason that they refuse to exchange the cable. They refuse it and ask me to show the serials number on both of my receives that she can write something on the file. Of course, I also refuse as I‚Äôm still not satisfying with her decision.

She said the store manager is not in the store.  I asked them; I would like to make a complaint about the store and who I can make a complaint. Janet said I can talk with her and Eric.   My question is;  if somebody were me does She / He does believe the complaint will be treated fairly and transparency or they will write or do something that I don‚Äôt know? Do I still trust the service from this store in general?  Please note here, She and Eric said that I got  my lightning cable for my I phone replaced by a chance or that person gave me the first chance to replace it. She also suggested that I may call support and they may send a replace by chance. For sure, I‚Äôm not happy and not satisfy with that.

Apple swear blind that these were authorised by an iPhone 6 that belonged to my daughter. I took the phone, switched it off and locked it a my safe....the unauthorised activity continued for a while until I removed the iPhone 6 and my payment method from the account. A few payments were refunded, then the money taken back for most of them, leaving me ¬£170 out of pocket. A few months later it started up again. No payment method had been entered on the account and yet my debit card was chaged another ¬£169. This would have been much higher if I had not alerted my bank and had payments to Apple blocked. Apple Support was useless. Their agent Noel even put forward the theory that someone was accessing my Apple account, despite me changing the password several times and adopting 2 stage verification, entering my debit card details, making purchases, then deleting the debit card number until the next time. I asked how this was possible given the 2 stage verification, frequent change of password etc.No explanation was offered. I next spoke to Marcel who had a further bizarre theory that my daughter's old phone may have been cloned. This still did not answer the tricky question of getting past the 2 stage verification on my account. Next I was put through to a manager called Nicky. She was  sympathetic and superficially helpful. It turns out that Apple refund requests are not dealt with by humans but by an algorithm. In my case one refund would be approved and the next 6 denied. In classic Little Britain fashion 'the computer says no'. All Nicky could do was to suggest I take it up with my bank. Apple plays snakes and ladders with banks, giving money back with one hand, when challenged, then recharging the account a few days later when the computer says no again. It is like communicating with the members of some strange cult whose sole aim is to relieve you of your hard earned money. I have lost count of the number of hours I have wasted over this issue in the past 4 months.

I bought a brand new macbook last year. Apple products come with a 1 year warranty. After using my laptop for about 6 months my screen started flickering. I have sent in my macbook 5 times for repair. The only time that the repair slip said there was a repair made was the last time i sent it in. I am not sure exactly what they did with my macbook the other 4 times i sent it in but i kept getting it back with the same issue. I thought finally it says what the problem was and how they fixed it that it would be repaired but unfortunately my screen is still flickering. I contacted them once again today and they advised me i would have to send it in again. I told them that i cannot be without a laptop because I am a student who unfortunately has to do school virtually everyday. They then proceeded to ask me ‚Äúwell the i‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre trying to get out of this conversation‚Äù. I spent almost 2000$ on a macbook because i thought i was paying for the quality. I did not want to have any issues with it that‚Äôs why i went with apple products. But it didn‚Äôt even last me a year before starting to give me problems. I am very stumped on what to do next. Everything I own is an apple product but unfortunately I will be having to find some place else to purchase my products. VERY DISAPPOINTED.,CA

We actually own several of their products and as a result of how they handled my recent communications, they appeared deceptive and looked for any excuse as to why they could not assist. My personal opinion of this, they are happy for you to purchase their products, but if an issue arises, the aftercare ethos is ... politely shut the customer down and get rid. So, with that in mind, congrats Apple on your successful execution of this, your aftercare is somewhat vulgar and certainly not a polished service.

All buttons working.  Value accessed at $45.  Advised agent that living in Mexico and delivery here would require extra charges for personal shipper from border.  Indicated would be starting a vacation in Jackson Hole on 8/26.  Requested delivery to Parkway Inn in Jackson Hole for 8/26.  She indicated tracking info would be sent to me when shipped. 8/17/21	Notified that my mother died. 8/19/21	Informed funeral scheduled in Houston for 8/30/21.  Would need to arrive for vacation 5 days later to accommodate funeral.  Our first stop, the Parkway Inn in Jackson Hole, where we would fly in, would need to be pushed to end of vacation, 9/12-9/16.  Contacted Parkway Inn to reschedule our arrival to 9/12/21.  They notified me that 4 packages from Apple had arrived on 8/23 and the extra days for storing them would cost me $10.each.  Apple had sent me two iPad minis! 8/31/21	7:45p plane arrives in Jackson Hole.  Had to check-in at Mammoth Hotel by 10p.  Mammoth is a 3 hour or more (depending on wildlife on the road in Yellowstone) drive from Jackson Hole.  First, went to Parkway Inn to relieve them of my 4 packages, then drove to Mammoth.   9/1/21		No cell service in Yellowstone, but Mammoth room had an old fashioned telephone.  Called Apple to advise that in Yellowstone.  No Fed Ex delivery available.  Would deliver by 9/16 at the latest.  Agent said that would not be a problem and thanked me for advising. 9/7/21		Arrived in Sheridan, WY and able to return by Fed Ex and UPS the second iPad and the trade-in iPad.  Used old iPad until today for emails, texts, and GPS, so still assured that all buttons and keys working properly. 9/11/21	Received email from Apple that they received my trade-in.  Indicated value revised from $45 to $0 due to ‚Äú‚Ä¶keys or buttons not functioning properly.  Received late.‚Äù  Called Apple to protest assessment.  Apple agent advised only option is just to return to me.  I indicated it should ONLY be sent to me at my billing address, since she could not assure me it would be delivered to the Parkway Inn before we left on. 9/12.  She said she would, and I would get tracking info. 9/15/21	Called Apple since I had not received any tracking info.  Agent said had already been delivered to my Laredo address. 9/17/21	Returned home and checked with my shipper in Laredo to determine if iPad delivered.  Not received.  Called Apple.  The agent indicated there was nothing in their notes indicating delivery in Laredo.  Would do some research to determine where it is and get back to me. 9/20/21	Received email from Apple that checking on delivery. 9/22/21	A.M.

Frequent useless updates that tend to remove and hide features. Old tutorials that are just months old often lead you to nowhere. There was a setting in Pinyin Chinese that allows the mac to ignore the letter 'g', after the update, I can't find it (I went to the Apple Store and they still can't find it). 2. Disorganized file structure. It may seem clean at first, but if you are trying to delete all files related to a software like Xcode, you will find there are hundreds of them laying in many different folders. You can delete some of them. For others you can't even move them. And the Apple technician told me to delete all of them. 3. Equating unreliable new features as innovation. For whatever reason, my touchbar flashes about every 1 minute. And there is the butterfly keyboard that jams and typessss several characters at a time. 4. Slow and unprofessional support. So I tried to use the Apple Care to solve some of those issues. I tried to chat with them online 1st but they are not specialized in Xcode (my 2nd pt). I scheduled and went to an Apple shop and that person is still not specialized. They said they would call back and email me, but absolutely nothing happened. I ended up factory reset my mac after spending hours trying to do what I said in pt 2. 5. Child porn iPhone news. No elaboration needed. 6. Frequent slowing down of speed (for mac) accompanied by loud sound of the fans and heating up. Sometimes random weird stuff would happen if you haven't restarted your mac for some time like Finder deciding you have no permission to open and change files you created. It is not a secret that Apple slows down old models before releasing new models of iPhone. 7. Doesn't support most games. 8. Bluetooth feature (between mac and iPhone) that doesn't work most of the time. It all depends on the mood of the mac if it lets your iPhone find it and airdrop a file. 9. App issues. For example, Textedit issues like when you created a table and tried to enter something it becomes like this ""imgur. c0m Slash a Slash BOhpEtA"". Another example: Xcode prompted me to auto fix a line in the C++ library (not my own code) and proceeded to tell me I can't do that.",US

At the end of January 2021, the Macbook screen was black with coloured vertical lines when I turned it on. It was returned to Apple who replaced the screen. In August 2021, the same thing happened. I used the PC in the morning and then left it on the table whilst I walked my dogs. On my return, I turned the PC on to find the same fault that occurred before. I called and spoke to Apple who tried to fix the problem over the phone. The attempt was unsucessful, Apple said that because the Macbook was now 14 months old, it was outside of the guarantee but it seemed there was a hardward problem. The Macbook was returned to JLP. I've just received a call from JLP to tell me that an Apple engineer has inspected the Macbook and found a 'pressure crack' in the screen causing an LCD bleed and this is not covered by their guarantee. The crack could have been caused by extreme heat or being banged. It was neither - no-one was at my home. The person I spoke to tried to insinuate that my labradors could have jumped on the table and damaged the laptop!! This is total nonsense, they can't get to the table and were out with me. The PC was also in a protective case to preserve the outer case from scratches. I live alone, use my PC carefully. I've used MacBooks for over 20 years and never had a problem yet this one has developed the same fault twice in 6 months. If this is the quality to expect from Apple it's time I bought a different make - I also purchased an Apple IPhone at the same time and that went wrong within 10 days. Sad to say, Apple has a captive audience it doesn't deserve. On principal, I will never buy another solitary item from John Lewis or Apple and wouldn't recommend them to anyone believing they are purchasing from a reliable company. to do business with.",GB

Not only is the new phone incompatible with all of my charging and accessory devices, but it did not even come with a charger or a set of earphones as pretty much every IPhone has since they were first unveiled. I've since seen the public statements from the company that this was done to decrease the size of the shipping box in order to reduce carbon emissions but then they conveniently point you to the accessories which are sold and packaged separately in their store. Is three boxes instead of one really planet friendly? No. Truth is the company loves to be progressive and forward thinking in their marketing but when it comes their actual business practices, they are scummy enough to make a Rockefeller blush. Don't fall for it folks. Leave this company behind and buy your tech products elsewhere as I will be doing in the future. Cook has really destroyed the reputation of this company in his time at the helm and I'm sure a certain former apple visionary is rolling in his grave watching his company give up their customer's data to government agencies and then try to rip them off with these ""integral parts sold separately"" scams that should be illegal.",US

I always buy Apple, but I had to write all of these points because it's really making fun of the consumer: - Very nice closed object, the coating of which still leaves far too many traces and fingerprints. A square of fabric suitable for the maintenance of this luxury product should be provided. - Screen light adaptation is not subtle enough. It goes through shades of green, red, blue and yellow every second. It‚Äôs disturbing when you are working. The variation is poorly managed. - The fixed front icon of ""managing windows open in the background"", in my opinion the most useful tool, has disappeared. You have to go look for it in the touchscreen sidebar - The tactile sidebar is too small for the fingers (I am female). It‚Äôs a genuinely useless, time-wasting gadget. It‚Äôs really giving crumbs when Apple can do better than that. In this case, the entire keyboard should be tactile, including the customisable sidebar (example: touch bar for managing ‚Äúfixed icon‚Äù windows).

The store said they could see water damage and that I would have to pay ¬£65 per pod to replace. I explained that I have not had them long and hardly used them, only for gym.  They said that sweat from the gym can cause it.   Given my previous issues with them and that I have hardly used them, I spoke to customer service who said there was nothing they could do and that I would have to pay that to either fix them or get new ones. When I tried to escalate it, she said that that there was nothing further they could do and nobody would contact me about it. She hung up midway through the call.  I am shocked that after 3 months of having this new pair that ‚Äúwater damage‚Äù can impact them from occasional gym usage. If this is the case, then this should be made clear in their advertising. It also should not be ¬£65 each to repair them (they said this would be the cost without actually looking at the issue properly).

So more money down the drain. Once my phone was charged, it asked me to log onto my Apple ID which yet again, required me to put in a verification code sent to a phone that won‚Äôt turn on. At this point, I don‚Äôt know if Apple even knows what technology is supposed to do: Make life easier for people. After a lot more back and forth and getting no where, I was being told to buy another thing.

Firstly, a customer service representative from Amsterdam Apple Support offered to send me again a new one (for the 3rd time after the same occurred a year ago) but since this seems a factory defect, I wanted instead to have a different version of it. This worker's supervisor, Ben, stated that since 1 year of warranty has passed they can only repair it at my own costs (basically worse and entirely different story than what his colleague said minutes ago).  Obviously, Apple Amsterdam doesn't know the basics of marketing, that customer is always right and secondly Ben thinks that we pay 220 euro to use a product only for a year and also he offers a different solution to the problem (ask me to pay for Apple's factory defect). They speak about warranty while they sell defective items to Apple customers to force us to spend the same money every year. As a person who owns almost all types of Apple products, I am not going to spend a cent on Apple products especially in Amsterdam anymore.

MacBook Pro Touch! Latest air pods! Several Apple watches! Latest Apple pencil! And 2 weeks ago my partner purchased a hermes apple watch online to be given a delivery date of today and the day after to receive a tracking alert to say that the item had been collected in China and to select alert options which we did and then nothing for nearly 2 weeks & no change in the tracking status so we called DHL Express who quite honestly admitted it didn't look good and that it appeared that since being collected from China it had completely disappeared! No scans at all & that we should immediately make Apple aware that they needed to immediately begin an investigation! Called Apple and spoke to several advisers & a manager & none of them would have it at all insiting they had tracking info that stated it was DEFINITELY going to be delivered to me on the 26th July (which DHL Express were shocked to hear as their systems were more detailed & they couldn't find that information) I argued & argued & argued and they insisted it would arrive with me today! I even had a manager named Anneget say she was taking ownership of this & would keep us fully informed needless to say that was another lie because not only did she not 'keep us informed' but she also ignored all our emails requesting an update on the status! ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è So when it hadn't arrived today and I couldn't get a response from Anneget I rang Apple and first call they cut me off after asking how we help you then went through a real rigmorole to speak to another woman called Sophia for her to say 'I don't know why DHL are being so negative as I can see it is on track to be with you today!' At which point I asked her where was the last place this item was located for her to look again & say oh I need to escalate this as your not receiving this item today? What the??? She had just insisted that I would seconds before just like the rest of them had all week! Anyway when I got annoyed at this and dared to ask have Apple outsourced the customer care as in the past I had been put through to a call hub in either England or Usa she then switched on me and said 'oh right is this just because I'm not English then? Is that the problem yeah? NO! The problem is Apple have taken ¬£1400 for an item they have not delivered and not just that but been downright rude & unhelpful over it too!

I had it repaired by an authorized Apple repair center because the laptop was covered under warranty. The Apple store rep did mention the repair may erase my data (not all of it was backed up); however, they never mentioned that I would not get any of my old parts back! Also, the laptop was returned in under a week which leads me to believe they never even attempted to retrieve my data from the hard drive or may have no way to do it. I wouldn't know because none of those details were mentioned on the product repair summary slip returned with my laptop! This is a problem because the hard drive (which stores sensitive data) is now welded to the logic boards on the new Apple laptops (the old Apple laptops internally stored them separately). I did not learn this until recently that the hard drive is attached to the logic board on the new laptops and all housed together. But why would they keep the old part(s) and not send it back to me, the customer and rightful owner of the part, nor tell me why? Perhaps if I had received my old part(s) back then I could have retrieved my data! Since several parts are ""all in one"" now, how do I know what was broke and what was ok?? They certainly never provided me those details. Not to mention, what did the ""authorized Apple repair center"" do with my old logic board/hard drive?? That hard drive contained sensitive financial and personal data on it, so why not tell the customer what happens to their old parts, especially parts that house sensitive data?? I did contact Apple support and they basically said once you sign off to have the repair done, they get to keep your old part(s) and erase your data and never give any details as to what really happened or what went wrong! At least with a car repair, the customer can request to get their old parts back!

There was a time I was ready to get a tattoo of the logo on my heart to show my devotion. I used to sell them to people as an Apple seller with 150% belief that it was the BEST computer on earth. Today not so much.  I bought a brand new iMac retina 27"" desk top from Apple.ca with upgrades which cost me 8K when said and done. It took over 2 weeks to get delivered (from china!) But I thought worth the wait. Once here I unboxed it, turned it on to install my basic needs, email plus Adobe  creative cloud. About 30 minutes of use, before I shut it off, unplugged it and put it aside as I set up my new office space to accommodate it. 2 weeks later when my office was ready I plugged it in and....DEAD. No sign of life what so ever. And the fun begins! I called Apple care which I had bought for an additional 350 dollars. Spoke to individual who made me do a bunch of useless plug in and unplugging steps over and over even though I repeatedly told them it does not turn on. I finally was connected to the nearest Apple store near me which is a ferry ride away as I live remotely. First thing the person says is can you tell me what the issue is with your iPhone??!! After explaining that I have been on the phone for over an hour discussing my iMac not my ijunk, they tell me because I bought it on line the Apple store will not be able to do the return! So I called Apple care again and spoke to new person and explained my situation. They refer me to take it in to an Apple retailer, made me an appointment for next morning with an apple'genius'...code for MORON in actuality.  I explained to them that I live remotely and will not be happy if I take a ferry in just to walk in and have some pimple faced 15 year old stare at me like a deer in headlights. Oh no sir I assure you that will not happen, you're all set. So next morning I pack up the piece of junk and ferry in to my appointment with apple moron. Appointment is at 11:20, I arrived at 11:22, Apple moron shows up at 11:40, was sitting in back jerking or updating his FB status, who knows. Then I get the confused look as to why I'm there. Then explains that because I bought it on line, he can't do the return! Just as I knew it would go down, it did! Called Apple care from my car, after 1 hour of speaking to someone who was actually competent, explained that I bought it online, and was told by Apple store that I was not able to return it. The Apple care person assured me that was not true, put me on hold, called the nearest Apple store to me that was 15 minutes away and set up my return. She gave me the name of the employee to ask for when I got there. I walked in, asked for person in charge of my return, was told she was not there and had left that morning....even though Apple spoke to them 15 minutes ago!!! Why lie about it? Then was told but maybe I can help you, what seems to be the issue? After 45 minutes of explaining my horrible experience I finally got my 8K back! I am officially done with this garbage company.

Anyway I recently bought my first Mac (MacBook Pro 2020 M1) and paid for support. So I had a problem on downloading Nord onto my new computer. I had a dialogue box come up telling me I needed a password for my keychain, which I did not activate when I turn it all on and started using it. This problem blocked the internet. Intractable problem, huh! Yes said Apple Support (by telephone). You will need to get Nord to uninstall and activate you keychain with a password...

On Thursday July 8, 2021 I was working outside most of the day with both phones in my pocket. Raleigh, NC was experiencing heavy rains due to a tropical storm. On Friday night, 7/9/21, the display on the iPhone 12 went out. Went online and made an appointment at an Apple store for 7/10/21.  The agent determined that it was water damage and offered the following solutions: 1) pay $449 for a repair/replacement. 2) buy a new phone starting at $399 and up based on various models. 3) pay $449 for a replacement iPhone 12 and then add 2 year warranty for $199 with a $99 deductible. However, even though I would be getting a new iPhone 12, the warranty would be retroactive to the original date of October 2020.  If I spent $449 for a new iPhone and compared extended warranty to no extended warranty it would be like this if I had another incident with water damage: Warranty: 15 months coverage (now thru Oct 2022) $199 + $99 deductible = $298 No warranty: $449 for replacement iPhone  My argument was that the iPhone 12 has a higher water resistance rating than does the iPhone 8. In addition, the water resistance decreases over time. The iPhone 8 is several years old and the iPhone 12 is less than a year old. Yet, both phones were exposed to the rain storm while in my pocket. The iPhone 8 is still working and the iPhone 12 is not.  The Apple agent stated that Apple does not get into the reasons or circumstances of how the water damage occurred, only that there is water damage and therefore it is not covered under their warranty. My counter that it appears that there was a manufacturing defect since the higher rated iPhone 12 was not as water resistant as the much older iPhone 8 was met with Apple policy of water damage = no warranty and no chance of manufacturing defect ever.",US

It took a bit getting used to iOS Big Sur, (being a fan of the older 80s & 90s software & even iOS Catalina) but I started to get along with it. The software was fine. Now, suddenly without me doing anything to introduce malware to my computer, I think Apple did so purposefully (since it is all digital and accessible by WiFi) just so they could spy to see what else they can force-sell to me. It is sickening. My computer will not react normally anymore. It has become slower than a turtle, and I swear I did not download anything malicious. I even turn off the WiFi whenever I am not on. Sometimes, the darn WiFi will turn itself back on right in front of my eyes. I am not kidding, nor have I lost my marbles. I am a straight shooter & clear-headed.

Within a couple of weeks she dropped it from a low height (60-80cm above the floor) and despite being in an expensive apple protection case it developed a hairline crack.  I called up and arranged the return under Applecare+, the box was received and it was sent off to apple for repair.  So far, so normal... A couple of days later I received an email back saying that it was being sent back to me unrepaired and that it was not eligible for applecare+ repair.  I called up and no one at apple really seemed to know what was going on as it's a different company that deals with repairs.  I was told that the iPod might have have been deemed beyond economic repair.  The next day the iPod arrived back to me, with the same hairline crack to the screen.  I called up apple again and asked why it had not been repaired under applecare+ - again, total confusion, much waiting on the line and generally no real idea.  All that happened was I was told a new box would be sent and I would have to go through the same process once again, this time with a contact at apple I could call if the same nonsense happened again. Ridiculous waste of time.  Once upon a time you would accept apple's premium prices because of the quality of the service and aftercare.  This does not appear to be the case.  I would estimate I've spent about 3-4 hours trying to resolve what should have been a straightforward repair thus far thanks to failure in apple''s processes & systems.  Not acceptable.  At no point did anyone at apple offer a goodwill gesture / compensation for the hassle and the time I've had to waste on this matter. I had been considering upgrading my MBP to a M2 chip MBP later in 2021 when they are released.  On the basis of my experience dealing with apple support I will be reconsidering that decision. EDIT Having been given cast-iron assurances that the first return of the item without being repaired under applecare+ was a mistake I have just received notification that they are sending back the iPod again to me, once again unprepared.  I have *literally* spent 4 hours on calls to apple support who just seem as bewildered as me as to what's going on.  I'm currently 35 minutes into a call I'm being asked once again to prove that the iPod was working and only had a hairline crack...  They've received the device twice now. TOTAL. UTTER. SHAMBLES.

You, Senior managers, are contradicting on their levels of advice and customer service. I called Thursday, May 27th, 2021, in regards to an order I placed for an air pod repair.  Repair ID # A494547235. I called the day I ordered this product in order to cancel the repair because I found my air pod‚Ä¶ The customer support contacted Senior management who said she would reach out to the carrier and stop the shipping on the product (Please pull the recording on this conversation, she never told me that I would need to refuse the package.) How can I refuse a packing that you never sent me a shipping email for, even after stating you would? The product was never in shipping mode as of Thursday the 27th. I assumed that the senior manager handled this. Until today June 1st, 2021, when I received the package when I got home. No one signed for it, they just left the package. (Hard to refuse something you don‚Äôt know is coming, let alone never receive a shipping email for). I thought the senior manager handled it. Well today I called and spoke to Trey, who basically told me there will be no refund, even after told by the other senior manager that I would receive a refund. No brand loyalty. I got told on two occasions to sell the product on ‚ÄòeBay‚Äô. So much for Apple loyalty. Why have loyal customers who buy from apple, when you‚Äôre sending them to EBAY? Trey the senior manager from today, was kind and apologized, but apologies does not stand by customer support and is inappropriate when there is zero resolve and will not let you speak to another person. As a customer who has spent nearly 10k on apple products in the last few years, I‚Äôm astonished in how you treat customers over $95. Customer service doesn‚Äôt matter to you, and brand loyalty must not be important if I can buy knock offs from EBAY and you support that. It‚Äôs very upsetting.

1508,www.apple.com,2021-06-01T10:08:43.000Z,1,Apple fails to match the level of customer support with the beauty of their products,"Sexy products, but as many other electronic goods nowadays, they are programmed to fail, as soon as the warranty expires. The difference in this case is, Apple products and maintenance parts are extremely expensive, so the customer support should be flawless, to say the least. My first and hopefully last experience with Apple Service was an awful one. First off, when you want to approach them for any human interaction, you can only book a ‚Äúcall back‚Äù on their website, which, btw, is coming on the language settings defined by the browser you are booking this service from. I happened to be temporarily in Germany, so the language was not my native one, anyway, this is not the worst thing yet. As a former happy customer of an iMac 27‚Äù, iPad and lately a Macbook Pro 15‚Äù, I used to believe Apple service would have been one of the best, in any case in line with the nicely refined products they are producing. Nothing could prove to be more wrong than this assumption. Apple is clearly enjoying a position of monopoly by keeping pushing nice looking hardware on a thirsty market, neglecting the long-term consequences of a bad customer care. Now, to the point in case: my Macbook Pro is not even 3.5yrs old and became unusable because of well-known and in internet forums documented hardware defects. I start experiencing problems already a couple of years ago, with the built-in camera out of order. I could still survive without it, as the warranty expired already, although I felt a laptop of this price range should have a longer longevity of the camera.  Then the problem with repeated keys on the keyboard appeared. I am a programmer, so you can imagine how this is hitting on my nerves (and professional efficiency in the end) when with the time this becomes a frequent failure.  The last drop came few weeks ago, when the so-called ‚Äúflexgate‚Äù issue started affecting my laptop as well. Display goes off as soon as the lid is opens over a certain tilting angle (about 40¬∞, below that angle I really challenge everyone to use it for a normal job). Obviously, I could not keep using it and I brought it to the next service point. Although the defect is identical to the one recognized as covered under the Service-Program on the 13‚Äù model, the authorized service point rejected to cover all 3 defects, presenting a huge estimate for the repair. The first frustration came, as the Apple phone support suggested me to go to the next service point on the wrong opening times. I had to drive there twice during the same day.  Secondly, they did not speak about costs which might have been incurred even in case the parts were not replaced. As I said, I was in a different country and apart from the language barrier, I was assuming, diagnosing a fault was not charged to the customer, as it happens in the country where I bought the item. Instead, 2 weeks after the service point presented me an invoice through email, no repair done, no goodwill exceptions approved. Not even a phone call is an Apple customer worth. The service point was hiding behind the fact that they had to check with Apple, if the defects were to be covered or not under any service program and could not know in advance about the decision. Now, obviously I was not happy with that outcome and called the Apple support again. The personnel are not showing any empathy to the customer, regardless whether I bought merely an iPhone plastic cover or if I had been a loyal customer of expensive hardware during several years in the past. They keep repeating that if any goodwill exception, this must be coming from the local service-point, which as you can imagine, in turn bounces back the responsibility onto the manufacturer.  At the same time, Apple does not do anything to push the service point in doing so. What a disaster of a worldwide enterprise who should really take seriously the advice or changing things for the better!  The impression is really, that Apple claims to operate on the field through a well-established network of authorized resellers and service points, but in fact they are totally disconnected and not working together, at least when it comes to meet the customer‚Äôs needs. I have been working in a customer support role for a high-end product for 15 years and the first thing you learn, is that customer is king, especially, when he has invested a consistent amount of money into the brand and when an evident failure is not caused by customer abuse but rather linked to a product demonstrated weakness. Apparently Apple is not yet realizing that basic rule or is showing arrogance enough vs. customer retention and advocacy based on the high profit they are earning through pure marketing investments.",DE

1528,www.apple.com,2021-05-25T03:59:29.000Z,1,Worst customer service I have ever experienced.,"I have been a loyal Apple customer since 2005, having purchased two iMacs, a Mac mini, an iPod, two Apple TVs, half a dozen iPhones, 8 iPads, and thousands of dollars in apps, music, and tv shows from the App Store and iTunes Store. Last week I purchased multiple complete sets of classic Warner Bros cartoons.  I also purchased 15 individual cartoons from the Bugs Bunny 80th Anniversary Collection.  The entire collection sells for $39.99, or you can purchase them individually for $2.99 each.  Many of these cartoons were repeats of ones that I had already purchased from previous sets, which is why I didn‚Äôt buy the complete set of this item to begin with.  Each time I bought an individual cartoon the price to complete the entire set went down by the amount I paid for the individual cartoon, in this case $2.99.  So after buying the first individual cartoon I could complete the set by paying $37, and after the second cartoon by paying $34.01 etc.   I ended up purchasing 15 individual cartoons for a total of $44.85, which is more than the cost of buying the whole set.  At that point I assumed the cost to complete the set would be 0, since I had paid more than the original $39.99 price for the entire set.  To my surprise that wasn‚Äôt the case.  The price to complete the set reverted back to $39.99.  I contacted Apple multiple times regarding this, twice by chat and twice by phone.  I explained to them what happened.  They have a record to verify what I told them.  I respectfully asked if the could complete my set since I had paid more than the asking price, or if they couldn‚Äôt do that then could they please refund the money I paid for the individual cartoons and then I would purchase the entire set for $39.99.  Both of my requests were refused.  I even had two supervisors get involved, the last one by the name of Janina.  It didn‚Äôt help.   This is not a lot of money.  That isn‚Äôt the point.  What is disappointing is that I no longer feel I can trust Apple.  To treat a long-standing previously loyal customer in this way, by refusing a simple reasonable request, tells me everything I need to know about this company and it‚Äôs culture.  It‚Äôs sad really, because when I first started buying Apple products I raved to my friends about how great their customer service was.  At that time it was the gold standard in my opinion.

After losing $75 when my iTunes balance disappeared into thin air and the only way to get it back was to find the gift cards which I redeemed, (which I couldn't find) I started to do some research. Since 2008, thousands and thousands of Apple users have had their iTunes or App Store balances just vanish. It's 2021, and Apple has not done anything about it. It's understandable, though, because they make $millions in pure profit from those balances. The most common scenario is after an iOs update, the user's balance just goes to zero. It's been happening for 13 years and Apple knows about it. The only way to get your money back is to prove to Apple that your balance wasn't $0.00 before the iOs update. This requires hours waiting on hold, escalating to senior CSR's and having the proof, for instance- the physical gift cards you redemmed. A process that can take hours or days. Some users that have the time and energy to bear that process are able to get their balance restored, but what about everyone else? Apple simply absorbs the profit. Even worse, if you mention disappearing account balances on the Apple forums, your questions get deleted and you get blocked from posting entirely. I'll be migrating back to Android as my phones and tablets get replaced.",US

I travelled to the store, they couldn‚Äôt give me proof of purchase in store and advised I request a copy from head office.

I really hope that others will have more luck or perhaps think twice about purchasing Apple products especially with the lack of empathy and understanding from Apple support team.  I have a visually impaired daughter who has been fighting for her sight since she was born, she is now 10 years old and has used an iPad as a key tool in her everyday life since she was a baby and unfortunately can't see more than 30cm in front of her today. We purchased the first iPad for our daughter when she was only 4 months old as doctors advised us that visual inputs were key to developing her sight and stimulating parts of her brain responsible for vision. She has learnt to use an iPad as a tool in her everyday life. It is used for everything from taking photo's of her homework to zoom in on content to relaxing and watching TV or socializing with friends. Recently her iPad Pro stopped working so we decided to purchase a new iPad Pro directly from the Apple online Store. Unfortunately the delivery time on the Apple store was over 2 months. This means that our daughter doesn't have a key tool she uses in her everyday life to assist her with basic tasks like school work or zooming in on items to see them. In an attempt to assist her I contacted Apple support in the hopes that Apple might be able to help, however according to Apple in Denmark they couldn't do anything. I asked if they would be able to speed up the delivery date, or perhaps provide a temporary solution but without even taking the time to research if this was possible I got a direct answer that this was not possible and not something Apple does. I have to admit I am shocked at the response from Apple Support and how they handled the situation. A hugely profitable company was not able to support a 10 year old girl with a solution for something so life changing.

But as my demands for certain things grew (had grown more than I had realized) the first Mac I got completely changed my standards. I had even disliked Apple before; thinking they just sold an expensive brand/image with the ""same"" hardware. But what I love most about my Mac is the OS; My impression is that Windows computers are built around the _computer_ whereas Macs are built around the human. It is much more fluent to use, and is far more stable than all PCs I have ever had (a couple of them high-end). Also; (I have the old kind of Macbook Air still) it has a build quality I have never encountered in any PC, and (actually the number 1 thing I look for in computers) it is completely silent 95% of the time, which is worth a lot to me. So yeah, I do think some famous brands are overvalued, but Apple (at least their computers - the only product of theirs I have used) is not one of them.",SE

Below is the review of Google Maps Apple refused to post on the App Store, after they had previously posted it for months without an addition I made. When you submit a review it is not immediately posted. I have recently learned that it goes to the developer, who has an option to reply or ‚Äúreport a concern‚Äù. Google had previously deleted SIX out of SEVEN related Google reviews at around the same time that were TRUTHFUL, FACTUAL, HONEST REVIEWS of appalling, abusive, corrupt treatment I had suffered over a long period of time at the hands of English solicitors, police and companies. Yet they ask you to help others by writing your honest account of your experiences with the company or at the location. Google did this to hide the shocking pattern of abuse and horrific treatment that I had suffered from these English police and firms. It deleted so many reviews without explanation, warning or notifying me or giving me a way to contact them to question, challenge or appeal its extreme and damaging actions and even when I used my Google Account feedback to write to them, they never bothered to reply. This is the Chinese Communist style censorship ability introduced by the advent of the internet and related tech firms, many of whom were seed funded by the CIA, NSA and DARPA.  My first App Store review of Google Maps was a one star review but said nothing about their funding sources. Some weeks later I added the removal of my six reviews and Apple allowed that, although Google may have reported it. It was when I added that Google was seed funded by the CIA, the previous edit disappeared (which seems to happen when you edit), but my update failed to materialise. So they removed what they had previously passed, without posting my update. Why did Apple not leave the former edit in place if they didn‚Äôt want my update? I now realise that Google developers reported my update, so they removed six of my reviews on their own website, then had Apple remove my review which spoke of their deletions. Google, which is a product of the US military‚Äôs DARPA, is a very sinister company.   I tried reposting and then re-edited my post to remove the CIA reference, I posted and waited a few days, then I became frustrated and I used the review writing facility to speak to both Google developers and Apple staff. I said my updated review was blocked, my OK‚Äôd review removed, that attempts to repost, even repost without the update hadn‚Äôt been accepted. I said I would make a complaint. Strangely, the next day the post I had been waiting to see posted suddenly appeared, but the next day Apple responded to my complaint by removing that which they had decided to allow, never to post it again, even edited, despite many attempts.  I have been prevented from giving any review of my experience of Google Maps app at all, which as an iPhone user of the app I am supposed to have the right to do, like anyone else. And this is with no communication from Apple or Google, who are deliberately frustrating me and adding to abuse I have been suffering for long. Apple tell the app devs they won‚Äôt tell the reviewers the devs reported them, but I know Google did take advantage of my frustration and that Apple is colluding with Google against one of their own customers to do to me what notorious censors Google have already done to me many times. My review of Google Maps suppressed by Apple: ‚ÄúWhat I noticed while using the app was that when I logged out and used it, I started getting ads from a taxi operator. This tells me my personalised log-in data coupled with my location data over time is very valuable to Google, like gold. So they don‚Äôt bother with the ads when you‚Äôre logged in. But when I logged out, they felt they had to monetise me in some other way. The personal and location data compromise with Google is far too much for me to use this app long term. They really prefer you to be logged in when you use the app, but it‚Äôs not necessary. I also found they encouraged (or one could say ‚Äútricked‚Äù) me to set location to ‚ÄúAlways On‚Äù, rather than ‚ÄúWhile Using the App‚Äù using the reason that I would receive up to the minute traffic information. But the traffic info was perfectly OK even when location was only on ‚ÄúWhile Using the App‚Äù, so I think it is highly questionable of Google to encourage us to have location always on.  No way is this app as ‚Äúfree‚Äù as it appears.""",GB

Worth saying I have been a user and advocate for apple for 36 years since my LC at the age of 7 to today. This is the second time my iPhone XR's screen has failed.  The first occurrence was a massive inconvenience, having to go into store and wait for over a week or two for a repair. On first occurrence its moderately acceptable for a consumer to manage issues. On the second occurrence this time its not acceptable for a consumer to be inconvenienced considering the original price of the product.  At it is the two support options don't work for me: 1. In store repair - I have a disability, I am at greater risk during this pandemic, I cannot go into store because I don't have transport, I will also not conduct travel during the pandemic. Lastly and importantly I will likely be without the phone for personal and mostly business reasons. My business is struggling in the pandemic as it is. I cannot afford to be uncontactable for realistically a week 2. Mail in - Again importantly I will likely be without the phone for personal and mostly business reasons. My business is struggling in the pandemic as it is. I cannot afford to be uncontactable for realistically a week. I believe apple need to supply a solution to help people in this period.

There must be pathways where apple TRULY support their customers and not just say so. That means not putting them at an extremely convenience for repeat faults.

I had the worst customer service experience of my life last week at an apple store in littleton Colorado. It was the store in the aspen grove complex at Santa Fe and Mineral. With Covid regulations, you have to have an appointment to even walk in the store. Which is completely understandable. So my family and I made two appointments. I was looking to buy a new I pad or Laptop. My mom had just bought a new I phone 12. The first appointment was scheduled at 5, this one was for me to talk with a sells rep and get help to determine what product was the best for me. The second appointment was at 515. This was for my mother and my daughter. They needed help transferring the data from my moms old phone to her new one, erasing the phone, transferring the data from my daughters phone to her old one and getting her Apple Watch paired to the phone. When we walked in at 5 and told them about our appointments, they started off by telling us that we couldn't have two appointments. That every one gets one 15 min session. We tried to explain that we were there for two different things but they didn't care. After having to argue with them for 10 mins, they finally told my mother and daughter to go wait outside in the cold until their appointment. (Which was in 5 mins). I was then directed to my sells person. He asked me what I needed a new I pad or Laptop for. I explained the things I use the products for and started asking him questions about the differences between the I pad Air vs the Pro vs the different laptops. I was asking about the processors, the memory and such. The sales person told me they are all the same, when your just answering E-mail. He made me feel like a complete idiot and after asking a couple of question in less than 10 mins, He told me I would be better off just ordering something on line from home. I was ready to spend any amount of money I needed to, I was ready to get the best product with all the bells and whistles, but left empty handed and so upset Im looking online for other non-apple products. My mom and daughter were up next. They told the genius about their situation. They were told that would take more than the allowed 15 window they were given, after waiting almost 20 mins for their appointment. (BTW we noticed 6 or 7 other employees just standing around while they waited.) He then told them their question was basic stuff and they should be able to figure it out on their own at home. My mom wanted to buy a new case and screen protector. She was going to buy the apple I care for both phones. But was sent out the door, also feeling like an idiot. I know this is long, but I just can't believe the total disrespect and complete rudeness of this Apple store. If your planning on spending any money with apple or have a question or problem. You will be better off watching you tube videos and ordering on line.",US

I didn't get the apple screen, they seem very expensive compared to others. I went for a 4K Samsung screen which is clear enough for my needs and less then half the cost of the Apple screen.

Bad customer service.,"As an owner of 7 Apple products, I am appalled at the customer service I have received today. It has made me rethink about Apple being my go-to company for technology products. It is the case in my household that an Apple purchase is often made without a second thought ‚Äì a new laptop? MacBook it is. Looking to buy a smartwatch? Apple Watch will do the job. Need headphones? AirPods are the best investment. Need computer peripherals? Apple Magic Keyboard and Mouse cannot be beaten.  Due to this decision-making process, I am upset today and challenging my thoughts; despite having enjoyed excellent customer support throughout the previous many years, it has left a bitter taste today. Having spent thousands of pounds on Apple products, my request today was for a value much smaller: I had forgotten to redeem the Apple Fitness+ 3 month free subscription when I bought my Apple watch. This can be put down to the COVID-19 pandemic and fitness not being a priority over the period. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay‚Äù, I thought, as the customer support will be able to help me, just as they always have. I was wrong. Having politely asked for an exception to the rule and have the offer on my account activated; I was rudely told that this is not possible. For a ¬£30 subscription, Apple has lost a client whose value is much higher to the company. It can be seen on my account that I am a loyal customer of Apple.  I‚Äôm not one to leave negative reviews for companies and try to see things from their perspective. I am also not disappointed about the loss of the ¬£30 subscription ‚Äì I‚Äôm disappointed that I had embedded trust into a company and felt like my trust was misplaced ‚Äì I have been let down. I feel betrayed for investing in Apple products only to be rejected without much explanation or offers provided. In contrast, other telecommunication companies offer discounts by the least.  Having portrayed my disappointment to the Apple advisor on the phone support, he dismissed my views without much thought. After telling him that I will be thinking twice before buying Apple products, he simply said ‚Äúwell, at least you know for the future how offer redemption works‚Äù.  I‚Äôm not sure I have quite grasped that yet, but I have a very clear idea of how Apple operates as a company.

It‚Äôs wrong that when you purchase a new phone which the price ranges from 500 upwards. They want you to pay for more memory. This is not right and is unfair. Because people can‚Äôt afford these phones yet take out contracts and are expected to pay for more storage. I like Apple because it is much easier than Androids. I am seriously thinking about changing my phone. Since, I have had these phones there has been nothing but trouble. For example, I had the iPhone 8 and had lots of trouble as time went on. I contacted Apple customer service who tried to charge you to have a look which ranges from 250-300 pounds not forgotten if they have to repair. They manage to do mine because of a error on the product. So, had to send in for a repair. And was easy enough to send. The only problem I found was that the link to say what they were doing was not helpful. After a few days I received a phone back was not my old one but apparently not a ‚Äònew one‚Äô or an ‚Äòused one‚Äô.  The reason was that my phone was stuck on the Apple logo and would not be removed.  I think it‚Äôs wrong as I have had androids phones and know people who have had them and they have had no trouble with regards to memory and batteries. For what the product costs Apple needs to improve the quality. Also, the storage says about on the device but there‚Äôs no way to remove it. Also, you should not have to pay for more memory when you buy a smartphone that costs a few hundred pounds. I expect it better than other phones.  I contacted the apple customer service again as this new phone keeps playing up since the download and told me to reset the phone and I asked whether it would delete anything and she said no but once came back on it appeared to have deleted. Another, thing also is iCloud backup as you cannot complete it without purchasing more storage as I‚Äôve tried many times to backup but won‚Äôt allow me.  I have 11.7 GB of 64GB used and yet it still appears to say the phone storage is full on my emails and settings and when I try to do backup.  I am seriously considering buying another phone because I‚Äôve had many iPhones and they are poor quality. I think it‚Äôs wrong a company can charge so much for a phone or product that battery goes quick and they expect you to pay for more memory and get fixed at their centre so you have to pay more money. Not everyone can afford to do so.",GB

I'll start with my iphone, while working on my phone with a store employee and getting very involved in what we were doing a store supervisor told the person who was working with me that they had to break away from me and help someone else and a new person was going to take their place and we had to almost start all over again. I ask why that took place and I was told that Apple doesn't want employees working with one person too long so they keep moving employees around. This to me is a major inconvenience to the customer, and this action demonstrates EXTREMELY  POOR customer service. We the customers deserve far better treatment than to be treaded off like an old broken piece of equipment. This practice is disturbing  and uncalled for and I would like to see this procedure changed. Remember we customers are your life's blood and your bottom line. I would love feed back...  Now my iMac, like my phone I have had a issue with my Mac for over a year, that seems to be unfixable. And after taking my Mac into the store, I was told that only software engineers could fix the issue on my Mac. Again while working on my Mac a supervisor told the employee to hurry and get done and move on. The issue was not solved and I was told that they would have someone call me to arrange to ship my Mac to a repair center, finally this morning I became tired of waiting and I called to find out what was taking so long. ""BUT"" while trying to talk to a support person my new phone started acting up and no one on the other end could hear me. I took my phone to the store and once again after working on my phone for a while the supervisor pulled the employee (who was doing a great job) and moved her and put someone new in her place and I had to explain to the new person what the issue was and what was going on, now I'm getting upset, and after working on my phone leaving me to complete the setup, I was told to once again call support about my Mac. They did say someone would call me this evening. When that person called I was told I couldn't mail my Mac to the repair center it had to be the store personal, so now I'm going bace to the store tomorrow with my Mac in hand and see what happens.

A few weeks ago I had a bad accident involving my phone resulting in major cracks on the front and back of the phone. I made a Genius Bar appointment at my local Apple store to see if there was any way of repairing the phone. The employee helping me told me that the phone could not be repaired, but that I could get some trade-in value for $50. I was surprised by this and asked the employee if he could double-check with a manager just to make sure I could get a trade-in value. He confirmed and told me I had 14 days to bring the phone back to the store to receive the trade-in value (I would have done the trade-in same-day, but I needed to do backup on my newly purchased phone).  Yesterday, I returned to the same Apple store to bring my phone in. I told the employee about my previous conversation with the other employee, and he informed me that my phone would NOT qualify for trade-in. Disappointed, I asked him if he could double-check with someone. He came back and confirmed that I would not be able to get any trade-in value for my old phone.  Now, $50 really isn't a big deal. I wasn't expected to get any trade-in value in the first place. But, I drove all the way to my nearest Apple store during a pandemic and even requested time off from work to accommodate my appointment with an Apple specialist. If the phone wasn't worth anything, I wouldn't have bothered coming in. This experience didn't make me feel valued as a customer and it makes me question the way Apple employees are being trained. Why would I have received two VERY different answers about my phone's trade-in value? I'm not sure. I think this is a great opportunity for Apple to better train their employees.",US

I get that they are trying to do the best during the pandemic but I have a few issues with people telling me what I can and cannot have or telling me 1 person per household when clearly they can see the person that your with has medical issues like a cane and clearly cant walk very well... So here is my issue, I get that shops have a guideline to follow but telling someone that they cant go in to assist their mother (who clearly has medical problems) immediately and after me telling them ""so your basically saying I can't assist someone who clearly cant walk properly...and what if she falls who is going to be the one to help her up? you guys cant touch her soooo..."" which made them look childish for stopping me in the first place.... so after them making the -acception- I was then forced to change my mask to a medical grade mask that I cannot breath in due to my own medical problems (I have asthma as well as low deep breathing due to anxiety causing thick masks to make me faint... Kinda like shoving your face into a pillow and trying to breath... I have difficulty breathing as it is) so after me stunned and looking at them for a good 5 seconds and asking them again what they had said to me ""we have to comply to store guidelines that were given to make sure everyone is wearing a medical grade mask"" still dumb founded because now I am being told that my mask that helps me breath, that I have worn even before this pandemic and my doctor telling me avoid medical grade (since the last time I wore one was when I was 5 and I ended up fainting in the doctors office because I couldn't breath -complained about them then-) so now I kind of had an issue. So in order for me to be in the APPLE STORE I have to wear a mask that a) feels like a pillow on my face b) causes me to faint & c) gets to hot in them which caused me to cough and freak quite a few people. So now being told I couldn't help my mother who cant walk and not able to wear my mask because it wasnt medical grade... OKAY so my mask is a garter mask with ear peices on it. Its a light fabric for those who run, bike or do alot of activities. I have 3 of them and never had any issues of going into stores until now. Which ticks me off. I do get that they are trying their best, but dont dictate which masks is the best. Mine covers literally the lower half of my head, light fabric and has unique weaving so my own spit cant even escape and doesnt over heat unlike the 3 layered medical grade. But what really gets me is that this shop isn't outside, it was in a mall... There was a total of 10 people waiting and the store was full... I dont take my mask off until I get back into my car. but of course, I had no choice in order to assist my crippled mother I had to risk not only my health (if anyone is a carrier) or someone elses (if I was a carrier) which is reckless to say the least and defeats the purpose of trying to keep yourselves safe. That was a poor decision forcing someone to change their masks because of APPLES guidelines for their stores. I could see if it was someone who WASN'T wearing a mask but for someone who was wearing a covering over their face and thats beyond ridiculous. So after exposing the bottom half of my face and putting on the damn mask we get in and I was already getting dizzy and trying to steady my breathing which was getting harder to breath in. The poor guy was watching me as he was doing a diagnostic on my mothers cell phone and asked if I was going to be okay... and I answered ""apple needs to change that policy of these masks. I am trying to keep myself coherent yet everything is going black"" the guy also agreed that the policy on dictating on which mask is the best and forcing people to change their masks in public does defeat the purpose of wearing a mask in the first place... after a good 10 mins I booked it out of the store and immediately switched back to my mask where I could breath properly. Its a good thing I dont own an apple product (yet) and if anyone is planning on going to the stores, if you have medical issues preventing you from wearing the medical grades you might as well wait till the pandemic is over, send it through mail or if they change the guidelines about masks. At this point its not worth your health and having to risk yourself on having to change your masks specially if you have conditions (low immune disorders, asthma...etc). Sorry for typing so much, but it really does grind my gears about being told what mask I can wear in a store. Im at least wearing a covering that is comfortable for me... If I do end up in the hospital because of this stupid move on which masks I can ONLY wear in the store and forcing me to change it right there I put the blame on APPLE not the people who are force to follow APPLE's guidelines. Putting me and possible others at risk is negligent because of what type of mask you wear when you go in the store.",CA

I've had it fixed in local iFixIt in under 3 hours, sold it, and bought PC. Sad after 5 years with Mac. The products are brilliant when they work, but the services are awful.

1703,www.apple.com,2021-03-26T17:34:12.000Z,1,Oh how the mighty have fallen....,"I‚Äôve used Apple products for over 15 years now, and have always been pleased with both the hardware and the support I have received...until now.  Having chosen to repair my iPad through Apple‚Äôs online service, I waited ca 10 days to receive the packaging in which to send away my device. I believe a good deal of this delay was caused by the chosen carrier (UPS) but since my contract is with Apple, and they didn‚Äôt provide any alternative options, I am holding them indirectly responsible for this delay.  I am also holding them responsible for sending the wrong packaging, that for an Apple Watch, and not an iPad, which was of course not fit for purpose. Despite my attempts to shorten the process from here on out by using the device‚Äôs original packaging plus the delivery labels I had received, I was advised that I had to restart the process (presumably to reset the clock on the repair) and waited an additional 3 days for the correct packaging to arrive. I packed away my iPad, sent off via courier the same day. I was advised that my device had been received the following day, and actually received a replacement refurbished product the the day after that, ie today. It seemed things were starting to look up....that is until it became clear that the replacement device, which initially powered up, is unable to hold it‚Äôs charge. Another 30 minutes on the phone to Apple‚Äôs support centre (having wasted 10 minutes with one employee who took various details and then transferred me to another department with no intro, causing me to have to repeat the security process) and the best they can do is to offer to ‚Äòpay for another repair/replacement on their own account‚Äô - how generous! I‚Äôve now completely lost faith in the whole process, and don‚Äôt see why I should have to waste even more of my time on this, time which is precious given I have a 7 day old baby at home, and a disgruntled 5 year old who has been without her iPad for approaching a month....first world problems I know, but within the context of having paid so much for this device and many others over the years, this is a truly awful level of customer service in my opinion. Furthermore, my attempts to get them to rectify this have been met with a request for me to wait till Friday until the seemingly very competent customer service representative I most recently dealt with returns to the office.....is this really the way one of the biggest customers in the world wants to treat a loyal customer? I suppose time will tell.... Update: While very pleasant, the customer service representative who asked me to wait until today to ‚Äòsee what more apple could do‚Äô was ultimately able to offer me nothing more than a phone call to waste some more of my time. Confused and contradictory messaging about whether they would seek to repair or replace my device with another device which would or would not be brand new wasn‚Äôt especially helpful, especially as it rather missed the point that I lacked confidence in this process as it already yielded delays and my receiving a non-functioning replacement. Ultimately, it seems Apple are either unwilling or unable to do any more than follow the standard repair process, irrespective of the fact that I‚Äôve already had to go through an elongated version of this process once only to receive a faulty replacement device, and that now 23 days on from my originally requesting a repair, I am still without a functioning device or a timeframe on when I can expect to receive one. Well done Apple, truly terrible service all round. Second Update: After yet more wasted time, this time via the chat function, I am still no nearer to resolution. On the contrary, there is now yet another delay to my receiving the packaging from UPS!",GB

I spent several hours with technical support over the phone but they were unable to fix anything, they indicated the phone was defective so they offered to send me a new phone by mail which would not work for me as I would need help to activate/ transfer everything into the new one and it would still leave me with Mac issues. I decided to keep putting up with problems until stores would be opened again.  Stores reopened, but I just had to keep waiting as I‚Äôm unable to wear a mask.  After our State Governor held a round table with best experts ever and decided to lift masks requirements, I finally made an appointment with Genius Bar. Today I made it to my appointment bringing a face shield just in case, to be in compliance but to my surprise, face shield is no longer sufficient for Apple even at this juncture when requirement has finally been lifted in light of overwhelming true science based evidence that masks not only DO NOT WORK, but they‚Äôre actually HARMFUL to healthy individuals, let alone the ones with medical conditions. I was told I had to wear a mask also under the shield or just leave the store.  I explained I was wearing a shield precisely as an alternative since I can not wear a mask but the masked man was utterly insensitive and determined to make me leave. I asked them if they were aware that the Governor had finally removed the masks mandates and he stated they only abide by their corporate policy. Then I contacted corporate office and spent 53 minutes on the phone speaking with Sr Advisor only to confirm that indeed, Apple Corporate, in utterly departure from science, have obliviously resolved to DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE WITH MEDICAL CONDITIONS.   I very much regret getting these items from these Nazis.  I‚Äôm now stuck with no service until I‚Äôm able to replace them both.  NO MORE APPLE FOR ME!!!",US

During checkout I was giving two choices for the order; mail devices to home by Tuesday, or Express Pickup @ local store (Apple North Star).  The item was listed as available today, so I chose Express Pickup. A logical person would assume express pickup would mean, the item would be available to the purchaser sometime today, since the order was placed at 12pm noon. So about 3:30 I head to the mall, assuming, the device would shortly be available. I stop by the Apple store with my purchase information and was greeted kindly by manager Andy. Andy stated processing usually takes a couple of hours. I educated Andy, the order was made at noon and it was 4pm at time of discussion, which is 2 x couple of hours. Andy called some corporate number and stated he was advised the order was showing still processing, but to wait on the pickup email and ask for him once I receive it and I would not have to wait in the entrance line again. Well, it's now the end of day two and the store closed already. I called Apple.com regarding my purchase,  and the young lady who answered the call asked what she could help with and I explained I was calling to check the status of my purchase. She advised me to hold on and the next thing I heard was the automated system asking me to enter the extension of the person I was trying to reach. I hung up and had to call back and spoke with a male customer service rep the second time, who stated they were reviewing my payment information and it should be cleared up in the morning. I inquired why would they they need to review my payment information and for what concerns? He stated, sometimes there could be slight errors that are reviewed and have to be cleared. I educated that I was in the local store the day before and if any information needed to be verified, then that would have been the best time to verify any concerns. The truth is, all of this has been a load of crock. These are operational issues and apple has demonstrated that after a year of closure, no one was intelligent enough to have a reopening plan in place. They have demonstrated a failure to timely process orders and provide standard customer service; which is the bare minimum below good customer service. We knew they lost the vision of the company when Steve Jobs died, but it appears they don't even have leadership capable of reestablishing a functional operation. Instead of fixing the problem, they chose to treat consumers as if we're all ignorant fools they can side track to cover their own failures.

In January I purchased the above to replace my 12 year old MacBook Pro which was still working perfectly well but I wanted to improve the sound and it was quite heavy and large. I go all the way back to the SE30's with Apple and I've bought 100's of their computers having run a print business most of my life. From the outset I have pioneered postscript and the Apple interface with the print industry and whilst always greedy for more speed they have usually met my expectations, particularly the FX. I have also often sung the praises of Apple technical support who over the years have excelled themselves. It therefore saddens me to report how disappointed I am in the Macbook Air M1 processor. I stress the M1 processor as both my children have Macbook Airs and are very happy. I'm retired now so my demands of a computer are much less. I gave my Macbook Pro to my grandson on receipt of the new  MacBook Air M1. My main interest is football & travel and I'm signed up to Sky, BT, Amazon etc to watch all the games particularly whilst traveling. I was therefore most disappointed to note Sky Go didn't work whilst it did on my  Macbook Pro! I also have a problem at my partners home where the speed of my Macbook Air is only 25% of that of my partners 7 year old Macbook Air again not an issue with my Macbook Pro. After numerous conversations with BT & Sky Go making no progress whatsoever, I and my partner made one last attempt last night. I was finally put through to senior technical support and thought at last. He said he had reviewed the history of my issues and without checking anything whatsoever claimed to have identified the issue, much to my relief, it was in fact my expectations of a new computer as in the first instance there are often issues interfacing with third party Apps etc. Well I was fuming and let him know. I finally requested the opportunity to complain at a higher level, he said it had got to as high as it can and the next step would be to complete a complaints procedure which he would forward following our conversation. I'm still waiting!!! Whilst my expectations of progress can at times exceed reality helped I would say by Apples copy writing, I did not expect to go backwards who ever is responsible! I'm not that heartless to request my old computer back from my grandson so I have to watch the game on my Iphone!!!!!

It had a green dot in any photos taken in bright lighting since it was sent to me.  I expected much MORE from iPhone and Apple.  Upon recently noticing an issue with my screen display (my phone doesn't have a cracked screen or hasn't been severely dropped), I decided to call for warranty replacement.  Since then, my opinion as a consumer of Apple has drastically changed.  They do every thing they can to avoid replacing the phone and make you do ""trial and error"" with no regards to how time consuming it is for the consumer, or how many phone screen covers you have to replace.  Then the worst was after I went in for the first ""repair"" when I really was asking for it to be ""replaced,"" and they had me wait 1.5 hours for the repair and then said the ""phone was fixed.""  After this the phone actually has MORE issues.  Including a serious issue of me not being able to hear the person speaking during inbound calls. I now have to take all my phone calls on speaker phone.  This is AFTER having the Apple Store give it back and say ""it was fixed"" and it not being ""replaced"" as I had asked.  The entire reason I was asking for replacement was to avoid these types of time consuming headaches.  APPLE has no respect for the consumer.   Today while calling to address that the phone was given back with MORE ISSUES than I brought it in with...I was hung up on by a supervisor after 30 MINUTES of TROUBLE SHOOTING because she didn't want to help me book and appointment and hung up on me when I asked her to hold for 1 minute as I own a business and a client was calling me on the business line.  She hung up an although had call back info, did not call back! So then I have to call Apple and start from the beginning.  I even explained all this to them.  I WAS HUNG UP ON AGAIN by Tia the ""supervisor,"" after doing about 40 MINUTES of phone support with her.  It seemed that she was making me go though UNECESSARY TROUBLESHOOTING when all I have been asking is simply to have my phone replaced through WARRANTY.  I  have experienced an issue with the phone that is eligible under the warranty for replacement and simply was asking for the phone to be REPLACED, not REPAIRED.  This is the THIRD time I had to call Apple support and the SECOND TIME I will be having to go back to the Apple Store in a week.  I will do my best to never buy an Apple product again after going through such unprofessional support, and having so much time wasted.  I was hung up on intentionally!",US

New phone freezes up and old phone is immediately deactivated. Spend hours online trying to see how to fix the freeze-try all the suggestions, nothing works 2/26/21 1-800-692-7753 spend hours on the phone all day with Apple support forcing me to try all the same tricks over again to get the phone to work. NOTHING works, finally they agree to let me send it back but say they have to cancel the old order to do that. (I assume that means the financing that trade in as well) She refunds what I had paid and tried to order me a new phone only to tell me that ATT will not allow men to place another order for 24 hours and there is nothing she can do about that. I explain I have no phone that works at this point and was using a borrowed phone. I explain I cannot call for police or fire that it puts me at risk.She is very sorry there is nothing she can do it is all ATT at this point. At first they wanted to get my phone in for servicing instead of giving me a new phone, I insisted on a new phone. I was instructed to put the new SIM card from the defective phone in my old deactivated phone so I could have a phone. I did that.  3/1/21-Call ATT, finally they give me a sales rep to tell me they are sorry but they can do nothing. Wait for 24 hours.  March 2, 48 hours later I sill can‚Äôt place order online because ATT still has a hold on being able to order a new phone.

March 3, 72 hours later I couldn‚Äôt order on Apple or ATT, old iPhone 100% dead now and can‚Äôt complete the verification code required by ATT sent to my messages because phone is dead. Can‚Äôt call anyone either. No chat function on Apple, found a chat function on ATT Spent over an hour being told my only option was to come into the store. I explained I cannot do that.

He was so sorry but could do NOTHING to help me. I am on my 8th day of trying to buy a new iPhone and being told it will take at least 2 days to a week more from Apple's side and who knows how much more time from ATT.

My phone keeps freezing and not backing up my memory, three times I got the same issues but they keep putting back to factory and all these times, I lost my pictures and videos. Basically the phone fails to back up so the only solution is to lose all my memories instead of getting a replacement.  The sad part of all these issues is that I am unable to make an official complaint because when I call I am calling Nicaragua, Hondura and India!!!

They ""issued"" me an iPad that worked fine but unfortunately didn't contain the compatibility to work with the Apple pencil. I work with seniors and signing with a finger for them is sometimes difficult. No brainer for me to get the pencil. However that also required that I get a different newer iPad than the one I was ""issued"" by my company.  I went out and bought one.  The device asked for an apple ID, I put in the one work gave me.  No problems there.  The problems arose when I left that place of employment.  I returned their iPad to them, kept my own and kept my pencil.  Unfortunately the apple ID linked to the IPad I own, I do not control.  The email it is linked to no longer exists.   Apple support is totally unwilling to help despite me clearly explaining exactly what the problem is and how I'd like it resolved.  I cannot use the iPad as I cannot remove this apple ID account. Apps that require updates I can't access. Content I've paid for I can't access.  I can browse the web and my email, that's it.  $700 I paid for this. I've told them that I didn't set up the account [I didn't, IT did].  I do not have the recovery questions as I literally did not set them up.  They're telling me to do things that I've already done.  No wonder I haven't resolved this problem in 3 years.  The apple ecosystem is hot garbage.  I'm not sure why anyone would subject themselves to this.",US

I was told it was a battery issue so I was given a new charger. A month or two later I took it in again and was given another new charger and no explanation as to why the Macs batter wasn't detected and wouldn't work without it being plugged in 24/7. I then took it in a third time and this member of staff took the Mac out the back and brought it back to show me the insides. The battery was leaking and had completely corroded whole board inside. (This could have been prevented if the first person I spoke to had done this to start with.  I was then told it would be around ¬£1,500 for the repair that it needed and I was best of just buying a new MacBook which is not what I wanted to do. I then requested to escalate this as it was an issue that could have been resolved if the staff had done what they needed to do the first time and actually looked into the Mac itself.  I received an apology by the manager who told me I would be better off buying a new Mac than getting the repair. I wanted to take this further so the manger offered me a discount on a MacBook. This was agreed that the laptop would be ¬£1,399.20 with a 24 month contract and a 14.9% interest rate. I agreed to this and was accepted through the Barclays partner finance app that the manager went through with me. However their systems weren't allowing anything to go through Barclays so I was sat waiting around for 2hours to be asked to come back the next day.  I went back the next day and the system was down still so I had to sit about for another 2 hours. At this point the manager offered me a case for the laptop free of charge. I sat for another hour with still no progress so I requested that it be stopped as I no longer wanted the Mac due to the wait. The manager then offered me another deal in which the interest rate would be dropped. I was told that the Mac would be ¬£1399.20 and there would be no interest. I agreed to this and agreed to wait a bit longer. The manager then came over and explained that it had finally went through however it would show as a 24 month contract but it would be around a 20 month contract instead as they would be taking care of the interest. He explained that I would be paying ¬£67.16 a month until the ¬£1399.20 was paid. This was what I had agreed to.  With that I received my receipt which stated the price would be ¬£1399.20 and I received my paper work from Barclays parter finance which has a total balance of ¬£1399.20 to repay and absolutely no mention of interest.  Skip forward to now. The full ¬£1399.20 has been repaid as well as more and they are charging me interest.  Spoke to Barclays and because it is an apple mistake they can't do anything about it as they didn't receive anything from apple to state interest won't be charged.  With this being an in store issue it is in store who need to resolve this however due to covid restrictions the store is closed. I tried to call the store numerous times and got no answer so rang the customer service line.  Spoke to a lady who explained there was nothing they can do as it was an in store issue but with me not being able to get in any form of contact with the store she agreed to escalate the case as I requested.  Spoke to a second agent who advised that he can see what he can do, took all the information etc to then say that apple have no procedures in place to deal with in store issues due to the COVID restrictions so I would need to wait until 'soon' at a financial expense to me until the store reopens and I can deal with this in store. I advised that the complaints get closed within a certain time frame so I wouldn't be able to escalate this again in which he advised I have a month. If the store is not open within a month I have lost out on ¬£250-¬£300+ which I should not be paying. This agent refused to accept this. I requested to go through to customer relations and was refused multiple times to then be given abuse off the agent, being spoke over and told ""you are in complete denial you can not speak to customer relations"" and then hung up on. I will be seeking legal advise, passing this onto the ombudsman and taking it to small claims court. Every time I get any apple products i always end up being miss sold, lied to and left to deal with it by myself with no help from customer service. They let me leave the store with a battery that was leaking due to water damage on the Mac and slowly corroding the inside of the Mac which could have caused an injury or anything as it was having to be plugged in to be used then I'm being told I need to pay an extra ¬£250-¬£300+ due to their mistake.",GB

Finally, today i got a customer service guy who did something - he phoned the hub (I gave him the direct number) where he was told there was a scan on 10/02 but now they cannot find the package - does this suggest stolen perhaps?

I am not a tech savvy person so naturally I brought the phone to a professional who told me they could not do anything but for me to wait for the battery to wear itself out.  This took days.

My Apple TV is still in perfect condition but somehow I have to fork out AUD300 to get a new model.  This comes from a company that prides itself with updates (probably the reason why my iPhone freezed in the first place) but could not update my current Apple TV model... I think Apple no longer reflects what the late Steve Jobs envisioned for the users - to empower them and the cultivation of creativity freedom.   Nowadays, using Apple products feels like in a concentration camp - all controlled and dictated by a very draconian approach from Apple.

Because I used to be able to register an Apple I.D. without having to use a phone number. However, the Apple company is now being controlled by American terrorists and Chinese terrorists who are anti-online privacy. Requiring me to enter my phone number to prove my identity just proves how they are anti-online privacy and they want to have their terroristic governments gather personal information about me instead of them politely minding their own damn business by not requiring me to enter a phone number and spying on my online activities. Apple doesn't have a justifiable reason to say that it cares about privacy because it's headquartered in a country that legalises gag orders. The other disappointment is that Apple's modern products have become expensively degenerated ever since Steve Jobs has passed away, which makes Apple not be able to hold a candle to its former glory anymore. Getting rid of the headphone jack lets me know that Apple doesn't care about audiophiles. What's really frustrating to me is that I've seen the quality of the customer support service from Apple drastically deteriorate because quality employees from Apple have been replaced by lazy employees who are only doing their jobs for a paycheck. I'm not surprised because more people are wanting to use Android phones, the Windows operating system, and/or the Linux operating system because they are tired of having Apple products cost an arm and a leg that don't last for more than 2 years. Because Apple's modern products have prices that have been rising to the point that only rich kids and rich adults can afford Apple products most of the time. Sorry, but I'm not going to enter my phone number and support a company that is controlled by Chinese terrorists who brainwash people with re-education camps, brainwashing censorship, and brainwashing social credit systems.

1910,www.apple.com,2021-02-01T17:15:52.000Z,1,Screen fault and consumer rights act,"From the very beginning I experienced a pixelated screen, it occurred spontaneously and only lasted a second or so, I thought I was perhaps imagining the issue as it was so instantaneous and I could never capture it on a camera. After explaining this to an apple support provider within the 6 months of purchasing the product, I was advised there was little they could do without evidence of the issue. To be clear, this fault lasted a second or less on most occasions and appeared differently every time, very difficult to capture. I took it into the apple store (locally), within the first 6 months of owning the MacBook, they ran tests and kept the Mac for 2 days, they couldn‚Äôt replicate the issue and it passed all diagnostics tests. At this point I had already spoken to multiple different apple support advisors, spent hours of my time trying to negotiate a repair and travelled into a town centre during a lockdown to try and get it fixed, missing significant periods of university work time. I was told to keep the Mac and no further action was needed. A few weeks later I just so happened to get a picture of the screen fault (around 6 months into owning the Mac). After calling apple again, I was advised to upload pictures and take it into a repair shop. The repair took about 5 working days. Weirdly this time the diagnostics flagged up a fault with the screen. They replaced the screen. One week after the repair I noticed the screen flickering again, and now it has been two weeks after the repair the screen is significantly compromised. The screen becomes pixelated and unreadable. I have asked for a refund due to the enormous inconvenience of this issue and because I don‚Äôt have the time to return it again, wait a week, only to have a faulty product once again. Currently I am in my final year of veterinary medicine studies, a very stressful and demanding time, this issue haas been ongoing for 7-8 months, I am exhausted by it and very stressed, I just don‚Äôt want the product anymore. Without a laptop I have been totally incapable of completing assignments and revising for exams, this is a significant inconvenience. Alongside this, I have had to drive to and from an apple store twice, of which take one hour each way to commute to, I have had no expenses refunded to me despite this being a fault with the product from their end, paying for parking every time I visit the store (4 times now). I have spent over 20 hours on the phone to different apple support advisors, none of which have ever met me with a mutually amicable agreement. I have been told to await a call back from an advisor, only to never receive one. I have expressed my frustration, anxiety and stress over this faulty product and the detrimental impact it has had on my studies, which has been completely ignored by the apple team.  I have explained that I no longer want this Apple Mac product, I quoted the consumer rights act 2015 and the final right to reject, all of which were ignored by the apple team as they refused to refund/replace. I have undergone one replacement which was unsuccessful and lengthy, therefore my claim falls under the final right to reject. Apple have stated the repair was done under the warranty, however I did not consent to this. I wanted the repair and the following case to be dealt with under the consumer rights act 2015, which would therefore give me the right to a refund/replacement. The reason apple have used the warranty instead is to void my right to a replacement or refund. Apple have told me that my only option now is to wait another week, drive another 2 hours, drop the MacBook off at the same service provider that didn‚Äôt initially fix it, be without a MacBook (or any laptop) for another week (despite having exams next week and moving location every 3 weeks because I am on my final year rotations), only to commute again, pay for parking again, to retrieve a product I no longer want and be a significant loss (time, money and effort), with apple suffering absolutely no detriment.  Under the Consumer rights Act 2015, final right to reject, I demand this product be either fully refunded or replaced and my expenses be paid for.  I have looked under the information sent to me, at no point is it explicit that I have been given a 2 week period to reject the item once purchased, which can be applied to any product providing it is not bespoke. Therefore if apple choose to ignore all other consumer rights, I want to apply for a full refund via this law- something I was never made aware of initially.  It should be essential that when spending a significant amount of money on a product, if it does not conform to a satisfactory quality, it should be repaired/replaced or refunded. I have already attempted the repair option, it was unsuccessful. Apple have dealt with this case terribly.",GB

They bounce it back to the store & vice versa. After creating a recorded memo they would not take the time to listen and still will not hold themselves accountable. We were quoted $129 for a battery replacement, not once but twice. They came back at $199 solely because they say it was a ""quote"" from customer service. Model 13"" MAC PRO BATTERY REPLACEMENT STATED AT $129 ON APPLE'S WEBSITE AND WAS ALSO QUOTED 2XS BY 2 APPLE ADVISORS.  BEWARE THEY WILL HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR MISTAKES. We spent several hours going back and forth and you can show them all of the hard evidence of the mistake yet they are not intrested.  Never call customer service. Always go to the store for quotes.

I registered help online and was called back within 5 minutes.  I had to reset my AppleID account on a new device, however all the Apps, contacts, mail and calendar, phots etc did not restore. A very helpful customer assistant, 'Perge' took control of my iphone to resolve why. He erased my account details on the phone and then called my landline while the phone reset. 'Perge' then went through the ID reset with me. Within 10 minutes, all my apps, contacts, mail, calendar and photos, everything  had before were restored.  I know Apple products cost more, the price is reflected in their after service support.  I'm so pleased they were there for support in my instance as all my appointments and 'life' are in the iCloud.  I am really appreciative of Perge's patience with me, his product experience and knowledge, restoring everything I had to this new iphone I originally had on my previous device.",GB

From my experience, their laptops are really good quality but their smaller devices aren't that great. My first purchase ever from apple was an iPad 3rd generation (about 10 years ago) and let me tell you, it was so glitchy and it kept crashing. After multiple visits to the Apple Store, they replaced it for me for free; which made me happy because there was something wrong with it. With the iPhone 5, it was really good except the battery would drain almost completely after a few hours. With the iPhone 5, they would not cover it under the Manufacture's Warranty and said that the battery was fine when it clearly wasn't. Fast forward many years later, iPhone Xr is very good, fast, battery lasts for days.  Point is, my experience with Apple is good when the product is good. When the product doesn't work, I am really upset. It's good when they try to resolve the issue. I do recommend the MacBooks though. My MacBook is almost 10 years old and it's still running really well. In case anyone's wondering, I never buy AppleCare, I just buy a really good case for the product so that the screen doesn't shatter if I drop it.  Customer service at Apple is hit and miss. I know Apple likes to empower the customers by teaching them to troubleshoot instead of troubleshooting it themselves; I have mixed feelings about that because it can come off a bit lazy from the customer's perspective and it's not good for customers that aren't technologically savvy.  I do think Apple is overpriced. I only purchased a new iPhone after using the previous one for many many years and there's too much glitches/issues with the product at that point.",CA

In the 6 months of owning my mac it had the screen\ and the keyboard replaced. When the screen failed AGAIN, they agreed to replace my computer. Their options were; 1. Pay full price for a new one and they will refund me the difference once my broken mac is inspected (ie several week later) 2. Send the Mac back for inspection and if they are happy, they will send me a replacement. Rather than be a further $2000 out of pocket, I chose the later. Apple arranged for a courier to pick up the broken computer. Not only did they not arrive, but the tracking number that apple supplied also showed there was no active job linked to it. After around 20 calls to support (i am serious) i was passed on to my 4th ""senior advisor"" who basically wanted to start the process again. I have a life to lead outside of talking to Apple and waiting for their non-existent couriers to arrive ""sometime between 9am and 5pm"" so I have decided to abandon the case. I wonder how many other customers Apple simply wear down through their appaling ""customer service""?

The simple truth is Apple is removing your files without letting you know... After I've been testing and analyzing files ""safety"" in ios or apple environment I came to the quick conclusion after barely a week... I photographed my new saved files on IOS and then checked EVERYDAY for a week if there were files being removed or missing without my knowledge. After only a couple of days apple had deleted MANY important files that I stored on iOS without letting me know..

2039,www.apple.com,2021-01-10T18:42:41.000Z,1,I am deeply troubled by Apple‚Äôs‚Ä¶,"I am deeply troubled by Apple‚Äôs response to Parler. Anyone could understand taking a stand against violence; however Facebook and Twitter, to this day, continue to allow violent threats against conservatives and Republicans, and allowing them continue gives the appearance of political bias shows it has nothing to do with ethics.  I used to resist getting an iPhone but eventually got one on recommendation. I grew to like the feeling of security and got the iPad and a Mac, but when I see police state tactics, silencing a group of people strictly based on their political beliefs, I no longer feel secure; in fact, I feel targeted. Why is this important to all? My family fled Europe before the rise of fascism. The first primary tactics of fascist is to use the circumventing of communication of the opposition and allow derogatory propaganda to persist. It is ironic that a company which makes itself successful providing superior communication would actually advocate to suppress it. If Apple had intended to take a stand against violent rhetoric, they would not have targeted one source dominated by one political affiliation. This means Apple has decided to advocate the promotion of propaganda and is no longer a company for all users. I find this action not only threatening but hypocritical of a man (Tim Cook) who no doubt faced discrimination of his own. Even in modern days, I face discrimination for my religious beliefs because it seems to be acceptable to judge my people based on stereotypes rather than merit. And now we add politics. So when you turn on the TV or listen to democrat politicians advocate for or dismiss violence against their opposing political parties, Apple refusing to take a stand against it takes away credibility. When technology changes fast, credibility can be the deciding factor in the longevity of any tech company. Also, it is important to point out that Apple refused to work with law enforcement following the Christmas terror attack on Dec 2015. Apple insisted they show that they protect their customers. I hated that they didn‚Äôt help but it made me feel that they would protect my freedom of privacy. So how does it appear now that Apple is willing to protect the rights of a  terrorist‚Äôs after murdering 14 people but won‚Äôt protect the rights of fellow Americans because their politics are different? The very civil rights we had to fight to get, you decided was no longer valid.  Rather than working with the creators or Parler, you chose to cancel them. Republicans are not the only ones who should be afraid of this. Government stance on anything always changes but people have opinions and opinions change. No group is collective in thought; if they were we would all like the same foods and the same weather, would drive the same cars, follow the same religion, same preferences, etc. Eventually every person grows and changes no matter what type of politics you agree with. Once someone deviates from that thought, everything changes.  Apple never took a stand when the news media and the politicians did nothing to curtail the violent organization from burning down buildings, murdering policemen, violently attacking conservatives, threatening to rape their wives, developing autonomous zones, verbally abusing Republican politicians, firing employees who are not democrats, and so much more.  I would prefer Apple take a real stand against tyranny and support all platforms or be fair and remove platforms on both sides of the political spectrum for exactly the same reasons to prevent the perceived bias and to show they really do stand against violence but this may be too much to ask coming from upset customer/investor.  Remember that in order to understand, you must have dialogue. The lack of dialogue is exactly why there is so much political turmoil these days and the prohibition of conservative voices will make it worse. This will cause unrest not seen in this country since the civil war. The Nazi uprise happened because of intolerance. You only have to listen to the incoming political party to hear the similarities. Even if you are angry and agree a little with them, you have to see it will take us on a very dark path.  I doubt if my leaving the Apple family will go noticed but while I search for a new phone with a different company and get rid of the many Apple devices I have, I ask that you reconsider your stance on Parler and work with the creators to come up with a solution which will be acceptable for everyone. I also ask that any solution you come up with will be strictly enforced to their competitors as well. Be the leader of free communication and at the same time condemn calls to violence. Be the leader and set the example that all can follow; not just the ones that agree with you.",US

2111,www.apple.com,2020-12-31T17:23:57.000Z,1,Oh where do I even start?,"Oh where do I even start?? Apple is a evil and capitalistic company. Apple only has many customers because THEY LIE AND MANIPULATE CUSTOMERS. For example, they say the iphone 12 has a new design. Look at all the phones they released in the last 3 years. The design hasn't changed since the iphone 10. Compare Apple to Samsung and you'll see who is innovative. Apple either is taking advantage of the brainwashed public and/or they don't know the definition of innovation. They say customer service with them is 99 percent and Android is 5 percent. That's bulls*it. Apple has such a stronghold against the public and so they can say whatever they want and people will listen, EVEN if there is hard evidence proving they are wrong. Android is far better and easier to use and I'm speaking from experience. I used to own Apple products for years and after switching to android, I can't go back. Android is easier to use and it's much simpler. Oh and when people say android gets viruses is bullsh""t. What about PCs? You have to be smart how you use it and not go to sites you don't know. Itunes is downright garbage and is very complicated. I saw a CBC news video of them scamming a customer. Apple rigs and locks down your phone so you can't repair it. If you repair it, it will disable the phone and tell you to go to the apple store. Samsung on the other hand doesn't do that. Apple charges you for icloud whereas android has expandable storage. To put in in a sentence, iphones are for noobs who don't know how technology works and android is like a pc and is for people who like tech.  Apple as a company takes advantage of you. The iphone XR uses a display of 720p but they say it's the biggest display ever, wth. Apple is a controlling and manipulative company. They don't care about you, only your money. They don't allow anyone except them to repair their products and they claim it's because it's done by professions. That's BS. Samsung doesn't do that. There is many videos on youtube that proves they try to take money from you. Louis rossman showed that they clearly lied and claimed it was water damage even though they just needed to bend a pen back. APPLE CAUSED THAT AND THEN SAYS IT IS THE CUSTOMERS FAULT!!!! Android just offers a much better deal and treats their customers right. Apple claims that your phone is screwed and you must buy a new phone for $300-$500 where as a 3rd party company see how it's built and it is reparable but Apple says it isn't. Apple wants you to buy a new phone instead of getting your current one fixed. I hope people will realize Apple is screwing customers over and doesn't admit it. I'm never going back to Apple. Apple has so much money which makes them think they can get away with the very wrong acts they do to customers. They will continue to do it until the public says to apple I'm leaving until you do things right. Apple is screwing you and everyone else. I have been with Samsung since last year and it's sooooo much better and I love my s10. Apple has nothing on Samsung. Samsung's displays are amazing.",US

We have purchased a high spec MacBook Pro which unfortunately we have experienced multiple problems with within the first 6 months. (we also have a 7 year old MacBook Pro which we have had no problems with). Upon calling Apple our options were to return the machine and wait for up to two weeks to find out if it is repairable or to be replaced.  Genius bookings are not available (which granted is not apples fault due to COVID) For us being without the machine is not an option which we of course explained to the help centre. With the prices apple charge and the whole foundation of the brand being built on the user experience there's a few options you would have hoped were suggested: - An express repair service - repaired or replaced within a few days (when you pay over ¬£2k for a laptop I don't think this is a big ask) - A courtesy machine (again I don't think a huge ask for apple to offer a courtesy machine as an option if people are going to be without their machine for up to two weeks through no fault of their own) - A replacement machine (as we have had to have 4 calls with you now for the machine that is less than 6 months old we're happy to replace it) These are just three options that could have been suggested... but none were offered. Even when we enquired about each we were told 'it's just not what we do'. We outlined that we were being told our only option was to continue to work off the faulty laptop and wait until shops were re-opened as we cannot be without the machine to which the response was 'when you put it like that, yes' This is a simple process that Apple needs to review... a little bit of effort goes a long way. Even the express turnaround option (which isn't the best) is still something that would have made us feel a little more valued and less likely to write a bad review. I'd like to stipulate that the customer service personnel were very professional and friendly, they just either have poor training on what options are available OR Apple just have terrible options available (I have a feeling it's the latter) I'm not writing this to give Apple a bad name, we're Apple product fans through and through. I'm writing in the hope that Apple read this and adapt to it. You can never please everyone, especially when you're the size of Apple but you can certainly do a better job and give your customer service teams something better to work with - I feel sorry for them.",GB

I made an appointment Apple Store Southampton Uk. At the store I was seen by Wayne. He said my phone despite being advertised able to cope with a rain shower had set off a sensor showing water had damaged the phone. He said not covered under warranty. In order to fix would cost me ¬£269 plus VAT. I said but phone sold as can cope with such situations. He indicated I could be lying. I said but the phone is mis sold and how do you get the rating then. He said different conditions as in a laboratory. I asked for a more senior person and then George arrived. He said if paid the money would replace. I said but I am the customer and your product is faulty why should I pay? He said nothing they could do as policy . I asked who the senior manager was and he said there are quite a few he would not give surnames as said not policy. The store was closing and lights going off. They were tuting and clearly annoyed still trying to resolve. I explained my mother is terminally ill and I can‚Äôt use my phone a phone that does not do as advertised. The security men were all around and felt very intimidated. One said I hope you have a very happy Christmas and gave a horrid look and another laughed out loud.. Clearly all annoyed and all men just clearly wanting to get me out of the store... The product does not do what they say and a genuine issue and problem. I don‚Äôt think ever felt so upset, belittled and disappointed at a very difficult time. I have always supported Apple but a a time of great need and sadness no support from Apple back...

I brought an IPhone 12 pro in gold and traded my IPhone 11 Pro in for it and they received it back and was to give me the max of ¬£500.00 given it‚Äôs condition I should hope so. I received various emails explaining my trade in amount of ¬£500.00 will be in my amount in 3-5 business days on the 3rd November 2020 it was only by chance I queried with Apple because the last 4 digits of my card it was being refunded too was not one of my cards, Apple took over an hour to answer, once I finally got through they took another hour to finally tell me that when you use Apple Pay it creates a unique 4 digit card number to avoid fraud - understandable! On the same phone call I queried when I will receive the money and they informed me it had already hit my bank account and that the case has been closed. Monday 9th November my bank accounts were searched by myself, by my bank, every phone call I had with Apple blamed my bank but my bank could do nothing as it was money coming in and not going out, the phone calls I made took 2 hours on every occasion. I then finally got through to someone that was talking a bit of sense last Friday (13th December 2020) and I was informed (nearly a whole month later) to be told that the ¬£500.00 never hit my bank account like they said and that it‚Äôs going to arrive in gift card format instead which I didn‚Äôt want. I appealed as it wasn‚Äôt even discussed if I would take that instead, even so I still to this day never even received the gift card! On Monday (14th) I called again, once again took ages to get through to someone but this time they took bank details to try sending the money to my account again, at this point I thought I was getting somewhere but no I was back on the phone on Friday (18th December) chasing again and going through the same thing I did right at the beginning of November, being told the same advice, ‚Äòsomeone will ring you from the payments team‚Äô, ‚Äòyou need to ring your bank‚Äô. We are now 20th December and still not received the ¬£500.00 and I even requested to send the phone back which they can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt do.

I have sat on hold for hours at a time to cancel the Macbook 16 inch for my son. I never received it and canceled it before shipment. I was notified on December 16, 2020 by Kiesha your customer support that I needed to return it before I can get a refund when clearly it was not sent to begin with. I asked for a supervisor and she ended the call making me wait to call back and sit on hold again.

I spoke to a Jeff who was a supervisor in sales department who put me on hold to check on these issues and told me I was ‚Äúcondescending‚Äù After these dealings of sitting on the phone for hours and not getting anywhere she also hung up on me and said i swore and disconnected the call. Your employees feel they can treat customers any way they want to because you have no complaint department and no way to speak to anyone higher than these so called supervisors that treat customers like garbage. I told Luther another supervisor about this issue and he said it would be a pending charge on my card, which was charged to my card on December 9, 2020. Your website shows that I was getting a refund in the amount of $189.74 for the leather case which was not opened nor altered; it was still in the same package it was shipped. I see that Apple is trying to get one of my returns to an apple card which I paid for on my credit card and should be applied directly to my credit card. I don‚Äôt see what the problem is because they were both shipped FedEx and not opened or altered in any way. I am terribly concerned with your company's return policy and the way that they are doing things. I was also charged a fee of $2.40 by Apple that has no explanation as to what these fees were. It should be a simple transaction that has turned ridiculously complicated for no purpose. I also was notified by Luther that they have received the packages that were returned and that it will take 5-7 business days for the refund, when your policy states it will be refunded when you receive the items in question. I am saddened that your company is turning into another chaotic corporate monopoly where customers don‚Äôt matter. I asked for an explanation as to what these charges on my credit card from Apple were and couldn‚Äôt seem to get anyone to explain what the exact charges are for.

If you dont know what your talking about, stop talking. 3. Listen to what is being said, instead of repeating the same line like some annoying robot 4.

My wife and I bought an iPad in December 2019. In August of 2020, the iPad developed wide lines on its screen, making it virtually unusable. We had not dropped the iPad or damaged it in any way. Even though the iPad was under warranty, we were charged $249 to repair it. We contacted Apple and asked that the $249 repair charge be waived. Apple refused to do so. At the time, I felt that I had been treated unfairly by Apple, but that there was nothing else that I could do. I recently came to the conclusion that I should share my experience with others so that they could be aware of the risks they are taking when purchasing Apple products. Here, in more detail, is what happened to me. The text below is from a letter that I wrote to Apple CEO, Tim Cook, on September 5, 2020. On August 30, 2020, I noticed that there were two intersecting lines (not cracks) across the screen of my 7th generation iPad. I phoned Apple Support and described the problem to the agent who answered the phone. He told me that since I bought the iPad in December 2019, the repair would be covered by an Apple warranty. I was then told that I would receive a box from Apple via FedEx, which would be used to ship the iPad to Apple for repair. Using the box that was supplied, I shipped the iPad to Apple on September 1. The repair ID for this transaction is D463437069 and the case number is 101170295110. On September 3, I received an email from Apple saying that its technicians had found a problem with my iPad that wasn‚Äôt mentioned in my phone conversation with Apple. I phoned Apple and was told that there was a crack in the iPad‚Äôs screen. Before the iPad was sent to Apple in the supplied box, there was not a visible crack in its screen.  I am requesting that Apple provide me with documentation of the crack ‚Äì the location of the crack on the screen, its dimensions and any other relevant information that would show that the crack was in existence when the iPad was in my possession. Since I needed my iPad back as soon as possible, I agreed to the repair. However, $249 is a high price to pay for an Apple product that is under warranty and was without a crack in its screen when I mailed it to Apple. I have owned several Apple products and have always been impressed by the company‚Äôs integrity. In fact, Apple has stated that:  1.	Apple conducts business ethically, honestly, and in full compliance with all laws and regulations. This applies to every business decision in every area of the company worldwide. 2.	Apple's success is based on creating innovative, high-quality products and services and on demonstrating integrity in every business interaction. Apple's principles of business conduct define the way we do business worldwide‚Ä¶ 3.	[Apple demonstrates] honesty and high ethical standards in all business dealings. As CEO of Apple Inc., I ask that you provide me with the information that I have requested in the third paragraph of this letter. I am asking you to issue me a refund of $249 if your inquiry into this matter concludes that I was treated unfairly by Apple, Inc.",US

To my shock, after turning on the phone I realised there was no charger!!!  I was sure it couldn‚Äôt have passed by Apple, a world class electronics company, to include a charger with a mobile phone. But after searching a bit more inside the box and doing a search on google I learned that actually the new iPhone does indeed, really, come without a charger!!!!  My options were to buy a MagSafe, a compatible power plug or use my old phone charger!!!  I called Apple and raised my concerns about the compatibility of my old iPhone charger with the battery of the iPhone 12 pro max.  I was told that indeed, the charging would be a slower, but that I can purchase the MagSafe or a charging cable separately! How can any company suggest for someone to use a sub-optimal charger (potentially battery damaging) or suggest for them to BUY an essential accessory like a charger (required for merely keeping a phone turned on) after they purchase the phone for ¬£1200...??? The adviser explained that the reason a charger is not included is because phones are being transferred to some new method of charging... So, instead of providing the option to charge the old way OR providing the convenience of charging the new way, Apple has decided to do neither and instead left it to the customer to worry about how they‚Äôll charge their brand new iPhone after they purchase it for about the same price as a the new MacBook Pro 13‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know about everyone else, but I would find it inadequate for any company to sell any phone at any price without a charger, unless the phone is purchased merely for the purpose of dissembling it using the parts or something It‚Äôs quite baffling how Apple can get away with selling a phone for ¬£1200 (possibly one of the most expensive phones on the market world wide) and NOT include a charger in the box!!!

Apples solution was for me to return the laptop and wait up to 10 working days to get a replacement. This would mean and I am unable to work. I asked if it would be possible to Apple to drop off and collect where they would exchange the laptop for a replacement which was agreed.  It was then apparent that there was no further laptop in stock and the only solution would be for me to upgrade and pay an additional ¬£300 pounds to resolve what was Apple initial negligence in selling me a laptop with 12 defected keys. I agreed to this, and then at the 11th hour receive a call saying that this is not possible and that they cannot exchange the laptop for a different spec and can only offer me a refund. After countless calls back and forth Apples only solution is to offer me a refund, leaving me laptopless and unable to work.

I spoke to one of their advisors who advised that I was outside of my warranty period, but for ¬£200 I would receive another pair of beats in the same colour porcelain rose.  What has happened so far:  I was sent a replacement pair of studio 3 beats in white.  This was a shock to me, as I did not and would not buy a pair in white, or a pair that was not limited edition.  At no point did any of the advisors suggest that this might be the outcome from this warranty exchange.  I called the customer services to understand what was going on, and I was told a number of different stories.  - Yes they are in stock in Porcelain Rose and we can replace them - No they are not in stock, but we will see what we can do to replace them.  - Yes you can have the white ones collected and get a refund - No you have to keep the white ones, and we cant give you a refund - We could swap the white ones for black ones - When you return yours there was no guarantee that you would get porcelain rose - When you return your beats you only get the option of white or black and it is pot luck As you can see the messaging of what options there are has been really confusing.  I have been on the phone to many different agents for around 3+hrs over the last 24 hrs discussing all of these options.  Where I am now:  Apple are refusing to refund, or provide any alternatives, and so I am left with a pair of headphones I did not order without any packaging to enable me sell on.   I am so disappointed with this service. I have many apple products and am a loyal customer, and this seems completely off.",GB

2290,www.apple.com,2020-11-18T03:40:59.000Z,1,Exploding iPhone Battery,"Last night while my mom was using her phone, it overheated and the battery exploded, splitting the phone and exposing the interior. My mom was very upset when this happen as it was a clear safety hazard and it was something we had never experienced from Apple products. We googled whether this is safe, and the results stated that this is not safe, due to the chemicals in the battery being toxic and flammable. Which is ironic, as the report Apple gave us stated they had to replace the display, due to chemical damage from the battery leaking onto the display. I wouldn't want to know what could happen. We took the phone in today to let Apple know that this happened and that we were upset. They said we had to pay for a new battery. Which my mom reluctantly accepted, as all her photos and data were in the phone and she didn't want to loose them. When we picked up the phone and asked for a report on why the battery exploded and whether this was safe, as well as why we had to pay for the replacement, the employee was unsure. Fair as this didn't appear to be a common occurrence or anything the employee had experienced. My mom asked to speak to the manager, as she may have more insight and and could hear our concerns. She was very rude and disrespectful, in regard to my mom being upset and concerned about her safety. When my mom stated that she did not feel safe with having a phone that could explode and asked whether she should turn off the phone before she goes to bed, the manager replied ""sure, do whatever makes you feel safe"", as if an exploded phone was not shocking. When my mom asked why we had to pay for the replacement when this was an issue that was out of our hands, the manager replied, ""It's just like the warranty on a car. If you don't have warranty then you have to pay."". Additionally, while my mom was visibly upset and had begun to talk over the manager, the manager rudely replied, ""It's my turn to talk"". A few points. This phone is a safety hazard. The battery was leaking. This is not your regular warranty situation as it is not regular wear and tear related. My mom didn't crack her screen and was looking for quick fix. We're not adding to the millions of reduced battery life complaints (however that was present). And lastly, this is not something which we as customers made happen due to our negligence. This is an appliance, provided by Apple, which is faulty and is a safety hazard. As customers, we shouldn't have to be penalized for Apple's faulty products.",CA

An apple employee and a mall security guard walked up to me about my issue. They told me I had to call AppleCare. I told them my phone is NOT working for the second time. How am I supposed to call? Then they proceeded to tell me to get a hold of a friends phone. My friends live 45min or more away, I have no phone to call them on, and I need service. I asked if they could schedule me for an appointment at the store like they usually would and said they had limited services and could not help me. I left helpless, drove to an outside source to hopefully get my phone fixed.

I was trying to ask about consumer law as well but apparently batteries never fall under that.. So I had to fork out ¬£129 to replace the battery. The only good thing was that they had it replaced within a few hours, hence the second star. Other than that, the 'Genius' guy offered hardly any advice, I felt like I wasn't really listened to and having been out of a job for nearly 6 months I really could have done with a bit more help, especially bearing in mind they make MILLIONS.

2322,www.apple.com,2020-12-04T19:51:21.000Z,2,Poor Customer Service & Poor Memory on Devices,"Update: I was having issues with my MacBook Pro updating. I finally got it updated, but Apple support was no help at all. I‚Äôve also been having other issues. Apple has an issue right now where all of my devices keep having memory usage being filled in what they call the ‚ÄúOther‚Äù category. It‚Äôs to the point that I can‚Äôt update my devices because the ‚ÄúOther‚Äù category is using up almost all of the memory on my devices. Even if I delete all apps, photos, files, etc. On my devices there is still not enough storage. I‚Äôve chatted with Apple support a number of times and the ONLY way to fix they can give me is to do a full restart wiping ALL memory. Which is VERY frustrating and time consuming. I just have to keep using my Apple devices watching the ‚ÄúOther‚Äù category slowly taking up more and more memory until I need to do another restart wiping all of the memory from my devices and then set up the device again starting the whole process over. Apple has NO fix for this and the feeling I get is that this is planned obsolescence by Apple so customers will see their devices with no memory and many customers will find it easier to just buy the latest devices rather than spend time wiping the memory and restarting the device from scratch. I‚Äôm sure this is great for more business in the short term to get people buying new devices, but I no longer recommend Apple to others like I used to. I‚Äôm on the search for better devices. Original Review: Apple used to have good customer service. I‚Äôm not sure what happened, but now it takes forever to schedule an appointment at an Apple store. Then you still need to wait for help even with an appointment. Then the ‚ÄúGeniuses‚Äù at the Apple store seem to be mildly trained employees that take forever to figure out what the issue is. Today (11/12/20) my Mac won‚Äôt update, and Apple removed the chat option from customer service on their website, so if I want to get help, then they make you call them and wait on hold until someone is available to pick up the call. This is SO disappointing. They don‚Äôt even have an option to leave your phone number to call you when they‚Äôre ready, so you don‚Äôt need to wait on your phone for hours.",US

I am a designer and apple is used in every job and every home application I have ever had. I now have a family with two young children and I have been having a lot of issues with the parental controls and family sharing. These issues are costly and dangerous as the settings for location content and billing are all affected by the technical problems. We paid arms and legs for Apple care support and every person in my family owns multiple Apple devices. However the support has been completely ineffective. We‚Äôve already been escalated to senior advisers and I‚Äôve spoken to multiple senior advisers and they all assured me that they are going to help me and then either drop off the face of the earth or completely ineffectively try to address my problem with ridiculous and basic solutions. Finally they have escalated the problem to engineering however the engineers ask for one task or one setting to be changed per week or month essentially getting us nowhere. Meanwhile my children‚Äôs privacy and use of their devices, during a pandemic when we are dependent on these - is compromised. We have not been able to speak to engineering directly it‚Äôs always through messenger which takes a lot of time and if you don‚Äôt happen to be available right when they call you‚Äôre essentially dropped. I have a full time job and 2 children to care for.The amount of time that I have spent trying to speak with and deal with this issue with multiple advisers is unacceptable. It has been months and my issue has not been resolved or even addressed in a complete manner. This is really the worst technical support experience I‚Äôve ever had with any company and I expect more from Apple. Products and support service are so expensive. Then to have problems that affect your family safety and your accounts and not even be able to actually address these issues with tech-support and not have any compensation or any additional support or escalation is ridiculous.

In fact most companies will not allow their secure information to go onto any cloud let alone the fallible servers at Apple. (No, Apple is not perfect and apple has no business even glancing at medical or engineering files). The bottom line, Apple does not serve professionals. It serves consumers.

Shame on you APPLE!  Mistreating a customer of yours that‚Äôs been using Apple products since the beginning! Apple customer service used to be top notch, now it‚Äôs simply awful. I Just upgraded from 2014 MBA to 2020 MBP that‚Äôs fully maxed out. I had the WORST experience ever buying from Apple directly. I had a little issue with my new MBP that I thankfully found out within 5 minutes of opening my new MBP. The CAPS LOCK key DOESN‚ÄôT WORK! So I call 1800 Apple who then transferred me to another department, who then incorrectly, transferred me to the iPhone department (even though we were always discussing a MacBook Pro), who transfered me to Matthew in which him and I had a conversation and Matt scheduled a call back to me with resolution.  After the call back from Matthew @ Apple in reguards to my issue and a promise/resolution he made me, he made me a promise to help me and then (yet again) I was blindly transferred me to the wrong department to a guy who had no idea what was going on. Even though Matt said he made the next representative fully aware of what Matt promised me and what‚Äôs going on. He even warmed transferred me over the the person and assured me that he informed the next department of what is going on.  So, after Matt hangs up the 3 way, warm transfer and said goodby to me and the other Apple representative that Matt had warm transfered me to, the next representative HAD NO IDEA OF WHAT WAS GOING ON!!!! How incredibly frustrating. This was so frustrating, that I literally felt SICK for the whole day because of how much time and energy was wasted and how Apple could lie to you after making a promise and then blindly transferring you to someone whose supposed would be ‚Äútotally filled in‚Äù about what‚Äôs going on, just for this representative to tell you the last representative ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt fill me in on anything‚Äù and that‚Äôs he‚Äôs really sorry but unfortunately can‚Äôt in ANY WAY get back over to Matthew (who we both just spoke to on the warm transfer). So Apple can‚Äôt even get you back into touch (not via phone transfer, not via notes, not via a call back with the representative (Matt) who you waited hours to talk to, who called you back and made you a promise that was NEVER FULLFILLED!!!! Oh and Apple representatives also told me there was absolutely NO NOTES on my account at all from Matthew, even though Matthew called me back from 1800apple with a resolution to my issue... So I ended up having several hours of my time wasted on the phone, transferred around over 12 different times, getting transferred to the wrong departments, getting told I had to wait 7 hours for a supervisor to call, and then being told it would be 10 DAYS for supervisor to call and that the previous representative shouldn‚Äôt have told me that I would get a supervisor call the same day.

However, I was also given a Smart Keyboard Folio, which is the worst keyboard I have ever used. The edges of the keyboard are heat sealed, like a plastic bag, and start to come apart within two months under normal usage. I didn‚Äôt have a receipt, so when mine reached the maximum level of decrepitude - literally came apart all around its edges - I went in to Bangkok‚Äôs smart new Apple Store and bought a second one for myself. Lo and behold, after two months, the same problem occurred with the new one, despite being carefully coddled. So I go back to the same store, receipt in hand, and the staff there, after considerable queuing, delays and whispered conversations, begrudgingly acknowledge that I was entitled to a new one. They first tried to allege that I‚Äôd had an accident and I had to argue with them that, no, this was a manufacturing defect - the edges are simply not wide enough for heat sealing to be reliable. After going through this treatment for 25 minutes, they then tell me they don‚Äôt have any in stock and I‚Äôd have to return in 14 days to undergo the same treatment, at my own expense. I asked them would they please deliver to my address, but no, they ‚Äúhave no such service‚Äù. The worst, most unco-operative, least sympathetic customer service imaginable.

The Apple products I currently own are: an iPad Pro 12.9 2nd generation, an Apple Pencil, an iPhone XS, Aipords first generation, Beats Studio 3. I used to own a Macbook Pro 15"" 2018 full specification laptop. I have had nothin but incredible customer service with Apple. The only issue I had was that I wanted to play AAA games on the go and I need a Windows gaming laptop for that. To solve this problem, I sold my Macbook Pro at a great price (Apple products keep their value more than the competition) and I bought an affordable Dell gaming laptop. Being introduce to the horrible customer service from the PC World made me instantly regret my decision (especially since Dell is rated as having one of the worse customer service experience ever). I plan on selling my gaming laptop and coming back to Apple. Apple might not have the best products for all of our needs, but one thing is for sure their customer service and their resell value beat the competitions, hands down.",CA

The iphone 11 experience I had was horrible, I've actually been crying over it. Bought an iphone at the Apple store, along with insurance, and unlimited icloud storage just last week. Yesterday my boyfriend proposed while we were pumpkin picking and then surprised me with an engagement/30th birthday party. We took a bunch of photos on my phone. At the end of the party, my phone starting going through a restart loop and kept turning on & off, only making it to the start screen with the apple icon before turning off and going black. It continued that way for over 24 hrs, so I took it to the Apple store where they said they could restore the phone or trade it in, but because I didn't back up my phone in two days none of the pics from the proposal would be there. I checked icloud and only some photos showed up for some reason, and of course the one selfie of us with my hand (you know, that basic ""We're engaged"" photo) is not there. The folks at the Apple store were sympathetic to me not wanting to restore my phone there, and pointed me in the direction of a tech company who may be able to open up my phone and grab the photos out of storage that way. However, that would likely not fall under insurance so on top of what I just paid for the phone, I would have to pay this company to get into my phone, and then I would need the phone back in the original condition in order to get it exchanged at Apple. I'm wondering what I can possibly do. Either I have to pay more many than I just paid last week to see if the photos are salvageable and maybe not be able to return my phone, or I definitely won't see those photos again. Just goes to show how reliable Apple products are. At least the Apple store employees were nice and did truly want to help after hearing the situation.

First off, I'm at fault for what happened, not blaming anyone else. My 6 year old grandson was buying some stuff for his games with an itunes card we had bought him. We completely forgot the account was tied in with my Visa (pre-authourized Apple TV payment). $2087cad in charges later and I called Apple support in a panic. The woman who helped (Leslie, she was amazing and sweet) said there wouldn't be an issue with refunds because it was obvious a child had made these purchases, but it could take up to a month. I waited and in the end got $195cad refunded. All the other charges didn't qualify for a refund. I appealed this decision and was turned down again. I called support back and they said they couldn't figure out why they weren't refunded so she asked a senior supervisor. That person  also agreed and couldn't figure it out either. I asked for them to contact the dept. that does the refunds but they are separate from customer service and they have no say. What is really horrible is that we have been long time Apple customers, spending thousands of dollars. Iphones, ipads, macbooks, Apple TV. I work in a customer based field and I've never refused a refund to one of my customers. Sometimes they order the wrong thing, mistakes happen. And I would understand if Apple was in financial difficulty but we all know they make a huge profit. With social media so prevalent, companies need to be aware that customers have a say now, and that can be detrimental to future sales. My family and I will no longer support this company. $1900cad is a drop in the bucket for Apple, but lost business from my family will be a lot more than that.

They will only cause more strife and issues for everyone during this disaster. It doesn't matter who you are, they hate everyone the same (but that's still a form of prejudice). That company is Apple!!!!! Apple has closed all of their stores down,in addition to their customer service is less than pathetic, and that's being generous. After talking to multiple ""customer service representatives"", they send an email for me to reply to, for an answer (that I might never receive), just for me to give the same information I already did multiple times.

I decided to go with apple because people claimed it was the best and it was the most expensive leading me to believe if people paid these prices it must be worth it. In the year 2020 I purchased a brand new MacBook Pro  and iPhone 11pro max.  I must say in all the years of using computers and cellular phones I have never had as many problems lost data and inability to fix these problems as I have in the past six months with Apple alone. Thousands of photos disappeared that were saved in a file on the MacBook Pro and that can never be replaced due to it being from a vacation to years prior that were placed in a specific folder and tagged. And now nobody can figure out what happened to them and nobody can seem to tell me how to get them back. You can Google 1 million things and none of them work and they take hours an hours for anybody to figure out even what half the time they‚Äôre talking about and Apple itself as far as support is completely an early useless. If you do not have a completely and utterly generic problem that they understand that they already have and put in a pre-recorded way to solve it you will never find an answer. Right now during COVID-19 their stores are basically closed down there is no way to get an actual person to help you and they deny having 90% of the problems that they actually have. Every day when I turn on the laptop more information is just gone. Every time they doing update more information that has been saved is permanently gone. And then their only response is basically to back it up to a cloud that you have to pay monthly membership fee towards. Which is ridiculous because I have not even utilized 5% of the total memory of either the data on the cellular phone or the laptop itself I should not require a cloud with a monthly membership fee for overage data when I have all of this space and I don‚Äôt want my information in a cloud I want it on the very expensive machines that I purchased. The reason I purchased these machines with all of this space is so I did not require information to be in a cloud it could be at my fingertips on the device itself.  It‚Äôs as if every single time they offer to sell me cloud space with a monthly fee and I say no they purposely delete more of my information and then proclaim it was because I don‚Äôt have cloud back up. I shouldn‚Äôt need cloud back up when I have 118 GB of space left. And all I‚Äôm trying to do is access 200 photos that were saved and in a file on the laptop. I made a horrible mistake of investing in three iPhones one for me and one for each of my children as well as this  expensive MacBook Pro.  Every day I think it‚Äôs going to get better and I spend hours of my life wasted away researching how to save in ensure things are saved on these devices into work with them and it is a waste of time because the next day I turn them on I try to do something in the information is gone again and I‚Äôm starting from scratch. People are purchasing the name Apple.  They are definitely not purchasing these devices for quality or ease-of-use they are buying it for the name alone in the logo as a status symbol. Me being my age have absolutely no interest in either of these things and wanted quality. It is unfortunate that this brand gets this morning rave reviews despite it having  such poor quality and poor performance.  My 19yo son with is majoring in computer engineering and my 16yo daughter who is completely tech obsessed have both admitted over the last 6months that apple appears to have no concern or intent on fixing it‚Äôs problems and design flaws, it is too preoccupied with putting out a newer version and charging even more money. With the newer version they can claim they have fix the problems in millions of people of already purchased them before they realize they have not. And it does not appear like they have any interest or intent on fixing previous versions to where they function and are useful for even general use. The largest tragedy aside from lost business and not meeting deadlines due to missing information on the MacBook was losing an entire folder full of photos from my vacation two years ago.  These photos have been in this file for the past 5 1/2 months I have looked through them with the intent of making an album for my mother as me and my two children and my parents have gone on a two week cruise and vacation. After my father passed away from COVID-19 I today went to put together an album and realized everything is gone.

That is likely to change on principal. I have bought 4 new qualified devices from apple in the past year. Each time they tell you your device comes with a free year of Apple TV plus. That is a lie! It was never offered. Apparently at some point someone on my Family share plan use a 3 month trial earlier this year. Which was cancelled when it ran out. We have bought 2 new iPhones since then and never got the free year. After contacting customer support and dealing with Kayla for an hour and a half and sending in receipts showing my purchase was only a month and a half ago, she told me that my free trial had to be claimed with in the first 3 months. I asked her to look at the date on the receipt. She said yes I see you are well within the 3 month window but I still can't help you. What a joke! Apple is not living up to their promises.

My problems arose when I requested for the Apple I.D to be removed from my own refurbished handset which was sent to me by my mobile phone insurance provider. After NINE months of going back and forth with Apple Customer 'Support' they have repeatedly asked for a proof of purchase for a refurbished handset which I received in 2018.  Had I not used the apple iPhone for downloading iTunes and apps I would understand but it seems that they are very desperate to force people to stick with their products even when they can no longer be used properly.   I understand why now, it's because their device sales have dropped consistently year after year.  Samsung and Huawei make magnificently better devices at cheaper prices. You have been warned people.

2500,www.apple.com,2020-09-26T10:01:55.000Z,1,"Avoid the new MacBook 16""","It's disappointing how low standards have dropped over the last 7 years, and is no doubt a symptom of poor leadership and lack of accountability.  There are certainly some highly intelligent, capable and well meaning people working for Apple, but this is outweighed by the quantity of moronic and incapable. It is now more of a fashion show than it is a genuine desire to design and deliver the very best tools.  The new MacBook 16"" has two major issues. One of these is the battery. I have a top spec model with 32GB Ram, 8GB GFX Card and i9 processor. Of course, this is going to use more power! What I have noticed though is when running certain programs that the battery will drain faster than it can charge. This seems totally daft. I would rather have a heavier, larger machine that can actually support its spec. These day's it's all about having the thinnest and sexiest looking tech and people care less and less for practicality and performance (as for most people who are not power users or do not rely on these tools to make a living, won't notice). The battery life when taken off mains power is also considerably less than that of my 2013 MacBook Pro 15"" which is still running like a train. It‚Äôs appalling really. I was advised that this is due to using programs that activate the GPU (like Google Chrome).  The Apple store assistants response was ""it will be because of the i9 processor and will say in the small print somewhere"". Are you kidding me?  The biggest issue is the screen. Which isn't surprising, as I had two replacements on my last MacBook. This one however won't reach the advertised brightness of 500 Nits, and the colour is off. This has been confirmed by Apple, who have offered a replacement. Only, there would be a minimum of a 1 week turnaround to repair what I work on every day. Great, good job I have one of their 5K LG 27"" monitors (which works perfectly). If I didn't have this, I'd have flipped my lid! The main reason I buy Apple products is for the quality of their screens, as I work in design. When I went into the shop to get it booked in (before finding out about the 1 week turnaround), the same assistant added to the case notes that ""he was unable to observe the issue"" with the screen.  So much for the hours that I spent diagnosing it, getting support and an engineer over the phone to take a proper look. You don't have to look far through Google to see that both of these issues are quite prevalent with this model. Neither am I surprised to read other reviews about iPads bending. QA (quality assessment) has clearly gone down the toilet, and in-store employees are pretentious know-it-alls who can't comprehend that you might actually know something. Which isn't a surprise either, as it seems there's a trend forming between buying Apple products and a lower IQ. All that said, when can I get the iPhone 12?",GB

2502,www.apple.com,2020-09-25T13:42:32.000Z,1,Don‚Äôt trust Apple,"Don‚Äôt trust Apple.  Okay now I never thought I would say that or be in this situation but, Apple is a waist of time and a joke.  We have countless Apple products in the house and one of them belongs to my girl friend. She is a well known illustrator and for her work uses the new iPad Pro with all the extras coming on at over ¬£1500. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the price of a product dose not mean it should or should not be taken seriously.  She has had this iPad Pro for 2 months and......, it has bent! Yes I said bent.  This iPad never leaves her desk in the office. So it stays on a flat surface at all times. Apple have said that this is a normal thing that happens with this product, in fact some people are opening the box to find its bent straight out of the box. Who the hell is in charge of Apple quality control. If this was a car company, or any other. This would be placed on recall for the item to be fixed. After all it‚Äôs not to say Apple are short of money, they have just exceeded 2 trillion in worth. That‚Äôs more than Englands national debts.  The problem is with the The devices that have a cellular capability, the aerial is wrapped around the side of the iPad, thus making it week and flimsy. Oddly none on display in any shops I‚Äôve check are bent. That to me is mis selling a product and as it‚Äôs known by Apple but not told to the buyers is also mis-selling and must fall under the Trades Description Act.  On all phone calls and face to face contact with Apple they are not taking any responsibility. In one case the rep hung up the phone. I do not think that we, or anybody else should be paying for this to be rectified as it‚Äôs not the customers fault. It‚Äôs a known fault of the manufacture and more than that, they don‚Äôt tell you about the fault.  So why do Apple get away with all of this. We are not the first and I‚Äôm sure we can remember the iPhone 6 that also had a similar problem. That was never solved. It‚Äôs wrong that the consumer protection bodies let Apple get away with this and are not protecting the consumer. VW got hit hard for the dirty engine that didn‚Äôt meet the standards it said it should so how and why is Apple, the most expensive in America aloud to get away with this.  The concept of the iPad has now gone obviously as the excitement, inspiration and creativity of an artist is diminishing due to the fact the tool she has to use is not even flat.... The funny thing is I‚Äôve just found out that mostly all of the components that make the new iPad Pro are not made by Apple, guess what is..? Yes that‚Äôs correct, it‚Äôs the frame. So you had one job to do and you couldn‚Äôt even do that properly.   Apple you have waisted people‚Äôs time money and trust in your products and your after care is awful.

High covid security, ""raise your mask higher, stand here, move here, get in that line,"" and worse.

Fine, but the man who brought it used his bare hands holding the cloth in the middle as though I'd be happy to wear a mask with whatever he has touched in the last 4 hours.  Then their staff takes my phone and computer and without wiping it or themselves, works on it and scrolls at will.  It's given back the same way...without being wiped.  Sorry, but if you want to play the heavy rules, then play by them yourselves.  Additionally you will find that the largest computer wizards in the world have an on line appointment system that can take an hour to process.  Seriously?

Why were we not notified of changes before they occurred?    You have completely spoilt my Apple pleasure which means I have wasted thousands of pounds.    Firstly you should not have removed Safari Top Sites without notification first.   That shows total disrespect for customers.    We went round and round the houses and got nowhere.

Apple have caused me to lose some very important details which a back up would not have saved as the facility (Top Sites) is no longer in existence.

I don't think the IT engineers at Apple have a clue what they are doing and because of that you'd have to conclude that the other departments are the same. I got into computers in the mid to late 1980's and at that time considered there offings third rate compared to what else was available. This is why it took me until the late 2000's to take a chance on them. I've spent money replacing their products than any other company in my entire life. They are garbage, just pure garbage. Fortunately there are many ways now to get the sources I use other than Apple and I'm in the process of re installing retro sound systems in my home with the new high quality systems available that weren't available before 1989.",US

2581,www.apple.com,2020-09-03T01:21:39.000Z,1,Defective Mac Pro and terrible customer service.,"Absolutely terrible customer service and defective flagship product that Apple know about but still sell. Bought new Mac Pro in April 2020 - Apple‚Äôs flagship system - but due to exorbitant cost charged by Apple for upgrades to the base system I chose just above the base, with a view to using third party components - priced at half what Apple was charging (as per the tech advice in numerous expert videos on you tube).  Advised Apple in advance of the need to upgrade it - even got clarification on what components would work/were compatible and the specifications - even confirmed the third party suppliers and tech support had no concerns.  Within a week the first system started crashing - did everything I could and everything Apple tech support advised - nothing worked.  Apple finally agreed the system was defective and none of the third party components was to blame - I had even removed all of these (RAM and additional ssd) and still system crashed in Apple factory sold configuration.  Apple agreed to replace the system completely - but nothing for the 8 weeks of wasted time, phone calls etc. The 2nd system was delivered in June and ran for 3 weeks before the same thing - crashes continually and randomly.  I hadn‚Äôt even copied any data or installed any third party RAM or ssd.  Upgraded and re-installed full operating system - several times, sent data dump to Apple at their request - to hear nothing, installed RAM and ssd at Apple request and removed it again at Apple request - Mac Pro still crashed repeatedly and would not copy any files.  I suggested it was a defective machine and something seemed inherently wrong for 2 to have the same issues.  I also suggested that Apple own operating system was significantly faulty (something echoed all over the web) - Apple refused to accept any of it.  Lastly I queried if their fabled T2 security chip might be the issue and one senior tech support made an aside comment of Apple having lots of problems since introducing it.  Apple suggested taking the machine away for several weeks and then letting have it back if they could repair it.  I pointed out I had paid for a new working machine not a repaired one.  After ignoring a number of my emails Apple finally agreed to refund the whole system (incl the XDR monitor).  However I pointed out I had purchased third party components to upgrade the machine and would be significantly out of pocket with no machine to use them in and they were not defective.  Apple accepted they (third party components) were not defective but refused to even discuss the cost.  I pointed out that legally these were direct costs and Apple had sold the system as upgradeable (so should expect people to do this) and I had advised Apple of my intention to do this before buying the Mac Pro.  Apple took advice from it‚Äôs legal dept and queried how much I‚Äôd paid for the additional components. I thought they were finally being reasonable but no their response to me advising of the cost was to again ignore my emails and mere re-state they would only refund the original purchase from Apple.  I appealed to senior Apple exec‚Äôs including Tim Cook but none answered and Apple exec customer service continued to ignore anything but the option they wanted.  In essence bullying their customer - I either accept a repaired machine (although no one could actually explain what they intended to repair) - not what I paid for.  Or I got a refund and was stuffed for the 3rd part components - which couldn‚Äôt be returned as they worked perfectly well !!.   Over the years I‚Äôve been a loyal Apple customer and spent a lot of money with them but all that counts for nothing.  I did try register a complaint about their exec customer relation - but guess who deals with those complaints - yep ! The very person who has been responding all along - so totally useless.  All in all, 5 wasted months, 2 defective Apple flagship products, appalling customer services, totally dis-interested senior exec‚Äôs just looking to cash in their own shares.  Wish I‚Äôd looked more carefully at the level of bad reviews on here - even if some are incorrect - just the sheer level of bad would be a red flag to any other company - but Apple don‚Äôt really give a fig for their customers at all.  I‚Äôm sure some of their general staff are good and some of the tech support were fine (just couldn‚Äôt fix the issues), but exec customer relations needs a new name - perhaps ‚Äúdo what you want the customer can‚Äôt do anything service‚Äù.    A flagship system, sold at very inflated price should work - Apple‚Äôs certainly does not ! And don‚Äôt ever try to upgrade an Apple system (even if they say you can) cos when the system crashes - you‚Äôll be left with all the costs and wasted time - Apple will just ignore you. I could not recommend avoiding Apple more strongly - if they treat someone spending thousands this way what hope has anyone got !",GB

Then there is a new charging cable, then there isn‚Äôt an aux jack so you are forced to buy special equipment to use a regular aux cord or be forced to use theirs. Now it is the 30% fee they are taking from people when they invest their money into something they want to buy. When will it stop? When will people realize that this company is a sham.

Swapped for another which had the very same problem of caplock not woking or requiring pressure to enable it.  Apple organised for the collection and sent confirmation of receipt, and I subsequently received an email saying my money had been refunded. This was on 2 July. I believed Apple, and checked PayPal which showed an amount of ¬£2,939. I stupidly didn't check to see if it was a credit until recently when I had a problem making a purchase elsewhere. I went through my bank stats and there was no refund from Apple. I rechecked PayPal which showed that of the ¬£3,338 I paid to Apple, I was only refunded the ¬£399 I paid for the after cover. My payment of ¬£2,939 was not refunded.  The figure of ¬£2,939 I had seen over a month before was showing that I had only received a partial refund of ¬£399 and ¬£2,939 was what was outstanding. I went back and forth between my PayPal and bank account, finally contacting Apple by email adding screenshots. They never responded. I contacted Apple by phone and after repeatedly explaining and being passed around for over 45 minutes, I was promised a call back which never happened.  I contacted Apple today to chase and the man from yesterday who had promised the call back (but never did), never left a note on the system, so there was no history of my contact. My calls are thankfully recorded. Anyway, I had to go through the lengthy process of being passed around, repeatedly asked the same questions and kept on hold, only to eventually be told that they'd made the full refund and that PayPal was responsible for my not receiving the refund. The proof? The same 'credit for return' note I had received on 3 July, which isn't proof of refund, but a commitment to refund. I contacted PayPal who not only confirmed that Apple had not refunded the ¬£2,939 but also that if Apple had refunded the amount, it would have credited just as the ¬£399 had done. They've now raised a dispute. Apple cannot refund the time invested in my running around for this, and the anxiety it has caused me. They also need to be taught to think outside the box. If a refund hasn't been received it's not enough to send the same email showing that a refund 'would be' processed, but confirming with your account team that it 'has debited Apple's account and was processed' Apple also needs to check its team for fraudulent activity, as this would have gone unnoticed and undetected had I not been impacted when trying to make a purchase. Iam now in a financial pickle while awaiting my money!!! Got to find that this has happened to others as well!  Lesson is never to trust Apple's refurbished items, never trust Apple's refund commitments, and always triple check EVERYTHING!!!

On September 23, 2016, my iPhone 7 plus was purchased with apple care for $1500 from the apple store. No service claims were made during the 2 year apple care period as the phone was taken very good care of. The microphone on the phone has started to show intermittent problems since two weeks. The issue went away for a day or so after I hard reset the phone. This exact same issue and behavior turned out to be a common issue with this phone that has been experienced by many customers including the 223 who logged their complaints on the Apple discussions forum on the web link  Clearly, this is a design problem that Apple knows about but denies it to avoid paying for all the unhappy customers. I have booked an appointment with the Apple Genius Bar at the Bayshore mall in the city of Ottawa. The front line worker and his manager (Eric Vinkle) both confirmed that this issue cannot be repaired and the entire phone has to be replaced for $449. I explained to them that this is a common issue with this model and that Apple has to fix it at their expense since my phone is in pristine condition and no visible or water damage could be detected. They looked up the phone and confirmed that it has not be brought in for service since it was purchased. The fact that they would not replace the defected components of the phone confirms that this is a bigger problem that Apple knows about but does not want to admit and bite the bullet.  Apple put something in the new ios that causes issues in older iPhone's to force customers to ditch their expensive phones and buy new ones. I made a complaint on the Better Business Bureau against Apple, they refused to repair it as the apple care is expired. After responding to Apple, they wrongfully closed the case. If you want to save your money and don't want a headache, please don't buy an iPhone",CA

Unfortunately, many recurring ‚Äùincidents‚Äù make me rethink apple more than ever before.

Gee thanks Francisco. At this point Apple won't even verify they took a claim and are looking into it.   Lesson learned...the old Apple is dead! Second lesson...if someone steals thousands of dollars from you, call the cops. They'll do the investigation for you and they'll prosecute. Last sad lesson...Don't buy from Apple anymore. They have zero customer service in case you get your identity stolen and have it used while in their shop to run up thousands of dollars of purchases for Mac Pro's and Sonos speakers.

Yet when I am finally able to book an appointment, the apple store said there wasn‚Äôt a CS code on my case and that they wouldn‚Äôt fix it because the extended warranty of the fault was 4 years and in their eyes I either don‚Äôt have the problem or its been so long that I‚Äôve learnt to deal with it.

I have been a fan because your customer service has always been way beyond exceptional, not only in Amsterdam, where I reside, but worldwide. ¬† Also, it is widely known that the 2016 Macbook Pro Touch Bar  had a defective  keyboard and was ordered to be replaced. I guess that when the keyboard was changed something was left disconnected and I had to take to a retailer to get it fixed. We noticed that the screen had a crack similar to my dog‚Äôs hair. So I decided to take to the computer to the main Apple store in Amsterdam. ¬† I talked to a girl who helped me check in my computer to be fixed and then I asked her to please call her manager because I wanted to make a formal a complaint. In comes Christian, who is the General Manager there, and I noticed he was looking at me inappropriately, and I proceeded to give him in the detail all the situation that was happening with my computer, and told him I was going to take responsibility for it (I had already signed all the documents taking full responsibility before talking to him) and I  agreed to paid the repair, which total was near 849 EUR. ¬† I wanted to make sure that the issues the computer had and what I had gone throw with it be known by him so I told him I had a recording of the conversation of what the technician at the retailer told me what he thought was going on. ¬† Christian, upon hearing this started acting defensively and telling me that I am not allowed to record or take pictures at Apple Amsterdam, yet other customers where doing so. He thought I had recorded him‚Ä¶ I also informed him that by law, if I wanted too, I could record anything I want to in the whole country without permission. He hastily decided to delete my complaint that the girl who had assisted me previously had graciously typed in previously. ¬† After I left the store I received a call from Christian telling me that he had decided not service my computer. I told him that  my lawyer would get in contact with him and hung up. He kept calling me several times almost to the point that I felt assaulted. ¬† My lawyer proceeded to send him a letter to Apple and Christian called my lawyer, and my lawyer had to tell him to calm down because he was too emotional and that in that way would be hard to fix the situation. ¬† ¬† After this I contacted Apple Europe on June 2020 and talked to a Jr Manager who understood my situation as very empathetic with me, he gave me a confirmation number for the fixing of my computer and told me that I should be receiving it soon. Well, I did receive an empty box, but with nothing in it. Christian keeps insisting not fixing my computer and has yet to give me my computer back. ¬† Keep in mind this has been happening since the end of October 2019. I have lost many projects and thousands of euros in investments because I have had to share someone else‚Äôs computer. ¬† It is August 2020 and I still don‚Äôt have my computer. Christian insisted in acting like a child and completely immature and refuses to fix the computer and because of this principle I need to take Apple to court. ¬† I have decided to make my situation public because of the childish behaviour given by the GM of the Apple Amsterdam store who represents this distinguished brand. Oh, and my amazing lawyer, Gerard Geelkerken, one of the top lawyers in Netherlands, will be taking this court because justice needs to be served and we cannot live in a world we‚Äôre an immature General Manager decides whether or not discriminating people. ¬† So, if you are in the Amsterdam area, and have issues or want to purchase an Apple product, please abstain yourself from going to the Apple store in Amsterdam.",NL

I told the guy helping that my son should of never even done that and to just take the charge off. I was told he couldn‚Äôt and it would have to be cleared before he could update my card information for my Apple Care since the original card was about to be deactivated but we could put in a refund. I wanted to update my Apple Care because of a bad experience before with Apple where my iPhone 7 stopped working because of a recall that they supposedly fixed two years before that caused the same problem but when I took it back to be fixed again I‚Äôm told oh well that recall has expired so you‚Äôll have to buy a new phone. I have to buy a new phone because your product stopped working again because of YOUR defect that you‚Äôve acknowledged and repaired before. I was told when I bought the new phone that as long as I paid for my Apple Care every month they would fix or replace my phone even past the two year mark which is good because I take care of my phones and I‚Äôm not replacing an almost $1000 phone every two years. So I wanted to make sure my Apple care wasn‚Äôt interrupted because Apple has shown to be shady before. That is why I even cleared the charge to begin with. Hindsight I should of waited and let the charge fall off after they saw hey we‚Äôre probably not getting this money. It‚Äôs not like my son was using what he charged during the pending charge state. It‚Äôs ridiculous they can‚Äôt cancel a charge that they‚Äôre being told shouldn‚Äôt of happened anyway. So I clear the charge just for the refund to be denied. Talked to 5 different representatives including a manager just to be told well he shouldn‚Äôt of said that but it‚Äôs nothing we can do. We can‚Äôt refund it. So I was tricked into paying for this $50 charge just to not be refunded like I should of and the solutions being I‚Äôll track down the guy who helped you at first so he can be better educated like his education helps me with the $50. We‚Äôre in the middle of a pandemic and this is how Apple handles mistakes by their representatives.

I kept explaining about problem in IPhone 7, I had multiple issues with  my unit like Reception, charging port was filled with ash one day but I had to clean, so that I can start my phone (for this I took that damaged charging wire to apple too, which nobody bothered to look) other problems Mic,. Now unfortunately their diagnose shows it has stereo output issue, which they said they will change screen. So problem here is that warranty will expire in next month plus I have seen charging port filled with ash, what if this phone starts fire in my house?  Now that girl was unable to help because she kept asking same questions ten time, I said I would like to see manager to keep it short as of Covid 19 issue. I ask manager i am 200% sure that charging port has issue and I always face issues at home, he kept saying one thing in arrogant way that we can only replace screen and for reception they told me you might be turning DO NOT DISTURB, which I am not because me and wife are well aware of this Option. So end of the story I have no proof of problems I was facing in physical form. He was diagnosing something else with his device. They never listen to my issues or might be thinking that i am trying to scam new phone from them. But I can't risk bringing that phone and charging in my house now anymore. So last I ask manager to keep phone there and try this with any employee or tech and whenever they trust my issues, they can send me other phone or repair all issues. Now on this manager said that we have note and even warranty expire we will try to look into it. I asked how long your note and your words are valid, so that I know clearly and avoid argument in future and he replied "" i can't give you time"".  In the last I left wire and iPhone 7 on the table and told them to just keep it. He rudely again said, ‚Äúyou can't leave this on our table"". I was trying to avoid making scene and shouting there. But this guy frustrated me that much I asked him, if I can't leave my phone on table because you guys are not repairing it, do you want me to throw in your ""GARBAGE BIN"", he said ""OK GO AHEAD"".

Send me away for 2 hours and a rude, disrespectful manager (Steven) at this store...with a smug look on his face then says ""well, you don't have to be here"".  Appalled!  Disgusted!  I could go on and on....but they've already taken up too much of my precious time.  They are not worth it!  No wonder some of my friends keep their Androids!",CA

Was meant to go to Manchester today but now am unable to hire a car due to this additional charge.  4 hrs later Apple tried to charge for the laptop again ¬£5499! They blame the bank and the bank blame Apple, they say apple pre authorised the payment but then didn‚Äôt claim the payment and left the funds in limbo. The bank can‚Äôt release it without something in writing from Apple. Apple say they have to use the method of authorising a payment at the point of purchase then charging when shipped because they get a lot of cancellations. I find that hard to believe, they are penalising customers that don‚Äôt cancel there orders over customers that do?? After spending several hrs on the phone to Apple / bank and even going to Apple store no solutions just a total mess! They have blocked money on account and tried to take both payments for MBP & Care twice. I am now loosing this shoot in Manchester tomorrow and feel like Apple don‚Äôt care. The store Manager said he can‚Äôt do anything, phone support are just as powerless and are messing with my work and am loosing this job!

Apple products and their service seems like a scam. They work fine until warranty expires and then boooom problems start kicking in ...SSD fails, logic board, issues with touch bar...If you bought apple care (on top of stupidly expensive machine) you could get all these taken care...but I am so annoyed by the quality of apple products and competency of people who make these products that a $3000 product does not even last for 2 years...I bought this macbook pro with touchbar and it did not even last more than 1.5 yrs, SSD or logic board died in the middle of a zoom meeting all of a sudden.  On tops of that with newer macbooks you cannot fix/upgrade anything easily. For example, if SSD fails...good luck you need to replace entire logic board (as SSD and RAM are glued to the logic board)...Making a simple repair...more expensive....  A perfect scam for getting customers hooked to expensive repairs or replacement. This was my last apple product  ...surely not buying anything apple brand in future...",US

I looked at the Apple employee who told me to get back on my spot and asked if he was serious? I hadn‚Äôt stepped any closer to the person in front of me or behind me, I had just moved to the side a little. I ignored this annoying incident and continued to queue distracting myself with my phone. Not paying much attention I soon got to the front of the queue and the next incident rattled me further. Without request, explanation or even curtesy another employee pointed a temperature at my forehead!!! It was the oddest sensation looking up and suddenly having a gun pointed at your head!! I must have looked shocked as he only then explained what he was doing. I told him he should ask first. My temperature was fine. He then gave me a mask, for which I declined. He told me it wasn‚Äôt optional and that I had to wear it to enter the store!!! Well what excessive rules Apple have imposed and Military style marshalling of their customers... the people who pay their wages!!!! Well over the top. Unfriendly, authoritarian staff, felt like I was in WW2 at checkpoint Charlie. Not going back to that store ever again. The experience left me feeling very uncomfortable and uneasy.",GB

Well they cant help you because you bought the phone used. They have wasted three weeks of my time. My recommendation would be buy any phone not made by apple.

I have been using mac from 2013 and I am very disappointed with this new purchase and will definitely returning it. The fan just keeps running on a normal task. old mac air was way nicer. had two ports of usb+ car reader and best they had magnetic charger which was awesome. in my point of view, Apple has degraded their product. hope with this arm chip they will bring something good. I am mean why somebody will pay extra to check their USB. not many external hard drives and USBs come with type c still, I guess its a stupid move. the whole point of buying a laptop instead of iPad is you don't have to carry extra stuff with you all the time.",CA

I am not well versed in the different features of Apple technology and was seeking some guidance to best accommodate my needs. I asked a gentleman the difference between a the MacBook Pro and air and he was very condescending stating that the name is obviously the difference. I quickly moved away from this rude man saying I‚Äôll have to think about it, when In reality I was trying to find a different advisor.  A couple of months after my purchase I noticed that my keyboard was faulty. I took it back to the Trafford branch and explained my predicament. The colleague took apart the keyboard but couldn‚Äôt put it back correctly and agreed it was in need of repair. He then went on to tell me that he would have to keep it for a minimum of 10 days. Due to the nature in which I use the laptop this was just not possible. I asked if there was anyway I could have a courtesy laptop to carry on my work but I was rudely rebuffed. So I returned home with my laptop in worse shape than before, I did however gain a verbal agreement that I could bring it back when I didn‚Äôt have such a heavy workload. A few months later, upon making an appointment to get my MacBook fixed I was told that I would be charged a large amount regardless of our previous agreement.  Fast forward to my recent interaction. I reached out to another Apple support colleague the customer service I received was just fine and after an hour or so going back and forth she agreed that my MacBook should be fixed as it was faulty and not damaged due to my own actions. She then arranged for packaging to be sent to my house followed by a collection Service in 3-5 working days. However, this has not materialised nor has it been collected. I feel very let down by Apple as I‚Äôve been trying sort this out for over a year now and trying to use a Broken MacBook is making my life increasingly difficult. Having invested a considerable amount of money into a product I thought would be substantial and a company that I thought was trustworthy I don‚Äôt feel this is acceptable.

2840,www.apple.com,2020-06-17T11:04:46.000Z,1,Apple Support is inexistant.,"Yesterday I had to engage with apple ID services for the first time. This was one of the most dreadful experience I ever had with a company in the telecom industry. My iPhone was broken but fortunately insured with EE. To be able to complete the claim process I was told that I will need to deactivate or delete the phone from my Apple Id account, which I did. Somehow the EE agent could not see any change on their screen which showed the phone was still active. There was nothing else I could do through the apple website since the device was no longer listed there. The phone was broke therefore I could re-list the device on my apple id account to try again. The EE agent suggested that I contact apple as they were the only one who could deactivate the device.  I called apple, got through their 4 minutes automated process before been put on hold for half an hour, when I finally managed to speak to an agent, the agent did not listen what I was saying, did not seems to believe that we deleted the phone from the account and insisted that I must have another Apple ID account, (which we do not). Finally, as the agent was unable to resolve the situation, I was told to hold while they were consulting with their supervisor. About half an hour later the music stop and a message saying that my call was in the queue started playing every minute. I waited a further 15 minutes and the phone call want down.  I called EE to make sure that the phone was still active and to check that I had the correct MEI number, EE confirmed that the phone was still showing as active and that they could not process the claim as if they did while the phone was still active I may be invoiced by Apple for the replacement of the phone.  I called Apple again and the same scenario repeated Itself, 4 minuted to talk to a robot before been put on hold for half an hour then 10 minutes conversation with a human, on hold for another 45 minutes and the call was disconnected. I call apple straight back and after waiting for another half an hour I was speaking to an agent again. This time to avoid been disconnected and treated with complacency, I informed the agent that I was recording the call, then explained the situation. after listening carefully the agent started to ask few questions before demanding for the conversation not to be recorded, I asked him to wait for a second, I stopped the recording pointing out, that since I informed him that the conversation was recorded I intended to keep the recording up to that point. He then asked me to delete the recorded conversation, as I refused to do so, he then ended the call without further discussion. It is now 08.00 pm I made the first phone call to EE at 2:45. After wasting 5 hours and 15 minutes I am getting nowhere, I will have no option but to try again tomorrow. This beg the following questions: 1) why the phone still showed as active after been deleted not working and switched off. 2) Why after having to hold half an hour to speak to someone on two occasions I was put on hold die a further 45 minutes until the call was disconnected. 3) What does Apple has to hide about a  conversation with a loyal customer related to a seemingly small technical issue, to go to the extent of refusing to deal with the customer who wants to record what has been said? 4) Why a customer should be threatened to have to pay the cost of a phone replacement following a genuine insurance claim, simply because he is unable to disconnect the phone through the platform Apple is providing for this purpose? 5) Why an Apple and a EE Business customer should be deprived of a claim and the use of a device properly insured for days because of an Apple ID glitch? This is how Apple treats customers having an iPhone, Apple Watch, Apple notebook, Apple TV and Iplayer...  If  Steve Job was still alive Apple will surely not be treating customers this way. Android provider must be delighted that Apple is becoming such a poor competitor.",GB

Anytime you used the speaker your conversation had a crackling audio sound. I did replace it with Sprint because they would only send me a refurbished phone. So I decided to go with Apple since they would give me a new phone. However, Little did I know I was going to have the same problem with my new iphone. It seems Apples 8 plus phones have the same issue. Having my mom at home in hospice I did not need any extra stress or headaches. Called Apple and they told me they would send me a new phone, however, it was not in a new box. It was a box just for the phone. I called apple and they advise me that this was a new replacement. The phone still had the same problem. Called Apple again (keep in mind it was my 3rd phone now in 2 months and the phone did not accept my sim card. Apple could not send me a new sim card because my provider was Sprint. Well, I had to go to 5 Sprint stores in order to get the sim card. Now that I had my new phone working I immediately mailed back the old one so I could get a refund. They tell you that they only take your credit card as a security, however, my credit card got charged. So within 2 months, I was charged $1000. Now let see how long it takes for Apple to give me back my money. That same day I mailed back my phone, my new phone started having problems with the upgrade and my new phone stopped working that night. So now, I have no phone. Called Apple again and tried to be patient. However, I spent 3 hrs on the computer with my new phone updating the software and guess what, my phone died completely; Now I have no phone. Apple called the Boca Raton store and they got me an appointment for 5:30 pm. So I asked Apple if they had a new Iphone 8 Plus and the Senior Advisor told me that they would not tell them of inventory. So here I am dealing with apple who is just wasting my time again, they had me do upgrades on the software, making me run around like a chicken without a head to find out that they did not know if the Boca Store had any new iphones 8 plus in stock. So I decided to call Apple again and have them send me a new phone but they wanted a credit card to hold a charge of $500 again and worse part is that they were not mailing me a new phone. They were mailing me a refurbished/certified phone. I did not paid for an used phone, I paid for a new phone. So if you are all reading this review, please be advised that Apple sends out refurbish phones. So is not worse buying from Apple anymore. Their products do not stand by their names. I will never buy an Apple phone, Mac laptop, or table to say the least because they all work the same way. I am a very disastified client and I do not recommend Apple to anyone anymore. What a horrible way of doing business with them. Their policy only benefits them, not their clients.",US

On 9/19/18, my husband and I purchased 2 Apple watches through Sprint(my second). I have been wearing my watch almost all of the time since then with no issue. On 6/12/20, I woke up and realized my watch was dead. Upon taking it off to charge, I found a round burn on my wrist from the bottom of the watch. I called Apple support on 6/15/20 to report the issue, just hoping for a replacement watch. I submitted photos to the representative and while on the phone with the rep, Tonya, I attempted to put the watch back on for the first time since I found the burn; she had said they may want a photo of it on to see how I wear it. I put it on and almost immediately received a shock from the device. The rep heard me yelp and advised me to NOT put it back on. She sent the information to another division and advised she would call me back in a few hours. Upon calling me back, she told me that they had determined that they would not be replacing the device and that I should follow up with my physician as I may be allergic to the watch materials(that I've not had an issue with since purchasing.) I am extremely disappointed with the way that Apple has handled this, especially because their product has caused me physical harm.

2855,www.apple.com,2020-06-12T05:05:46.000Z,5,Apple does care!,"I'm surprised that there are so many negative comments about customer service. I've been purchasing Apple and Windows products for 15 years and Apple have always treated me well. I had a Sony Vaio that was constantly plagued with problems (wifi, keyboard, screen, battery, trackpad) and would spend 8 weeks at a time being serviced by Sony (thats how long it took them to repair any issue I had). Since these issues didnt all arise at once I would send it in for repair and wait 2 months to get it back only to have used it for a few days until a new issue would pop up and the cycle repeated. I ended up shoving the laptop at the back of my closet in frustration and Sony would go on to cease making laptops altogether. My next purchase was a 13 inch Macbook Pro in 2017 that served me well over the years with no issues until recently. One was the problematic keyboard that many complained about (thankfully the new 2020 models don't have this issue any more). The second problem I had was with the screen. In an act of rage i slammed the lid on my Macbook with great force because of some bad news I received and the screen went completely black and would'nt turn on. My Macbook was just out of warranty and I was worried it would cost me a fortune to fix. I took it in to the Apple store in Chatswood for repair and they replaced my keyboard for free and they replaced my screen and didn't charge me for the parts (which is not cheap and can cost anywhere between $400-$1200 for a new screen). Apple only charged me $149 for the service fee. Since my warranty was void Apple could have charged me for every piece i needed repaired if they wanted to. However, they were kind enough to supply the parts free and only charge me the service fee. This goes to show that Apple does really care about customer satisfaction. Thank You Apple!",AU

She said that the apple watch may do the things I wanted. What cutting edge, out of the box, innovative features did I hope to have? 1. A screen large enough so that I don't have to hold the device to my face to see the tiny letters; and large enough that I don't have to have a finger the size of a pencil to press tiny buttons on the screen. 2. I wanted to be able to play music from the watch. NOT to have the watch just act as a middle-man between my smartphone music app. That's just stupid. Let me repeat, having a smart watch that just plays music via bluetooth from the smartphone then to headphones is something concocted by a special kind of stupid human. I want to have the music downloaded ON the smartwatch and played via bluetooth to headphones. You know, like how some MP3 players worked 10 years ago. So.... actually not original or innovative at all. 3. I want a stopwatch. One that has a timer countdown before an auto-start. You know, like how many quality watches that costs about $100 or above can offer. But with a smartwatch, I need only tap on the screen to start, and tap again to stop. Because, and I know this sounds crazy and requires totally out of the box thinking, after running really fast, or performing an exhausting exercise that you're trying to time, it's infuriatingly annoying to have to find and press a button to stop the timer. Especially when your drenched in sweat and sweat is running in your eyes. Just tap the screen to turn on the auto-timer...wait for the beep countdown, and start training. As soon as you're done, tap the screen again. I KNOW, I KNOW, This kind of innovative, genius thinking is beyond the high-paid designers at Apple. 4. I know FOUR things. But this is the last one. Ready? This will blow your mind. I would like a watch (especially one that costs nearly half a grand) to display my heart rate at all times. Have it in a corner of the screen. Because, and I know this is expecting far too much, but while I'm physically exerting myself doing interval training, I would like to simply look at my watch and get my heart rate. I don't want to have to press a button on the screen. Wait for the results and wait to see the data. I don't want to carry Apple's brick of a smartphone that I must also wrap with a large protective covering, because iPhones are fragile as overpriced fine china. Well, I got this iWatch piece of garbage. Charged it. Set it up. I downloaded Spotify (because I stopped using Apple's terrible music service a lone time ago). Oh, one can see a parallel between Apple's worsening quality of products, lack of innovation, and idiotic ideas with the slow demise of what was once a great music platform: iTunes. Apple failed to deliver yet again. I couldn't do not a single thing I mentioned above. A $500 watch failed to do any of the things I listed because of lazy design, needless app restrictions, or design flaws.",US

I have owned a MacBook Pro for some years now and when I purchased it I took out AppleCare. It ran out many years ago but when I call Apple for help the service is second to none. I am not very technologically inclined but they always help me if I get stuck by taking over my screen (with no access to my content I hasten to say) and very soon set me back on the right path. If the service person hasn‚Äôt enough knowledge for my particular problem they refer it to a specialist and I have never, in about seven years, been let down. They are never in a hurry and will spend as much time as is needed to resolve any problems. This service is why I would never purchase anything but Apple and can absolutely recommend the products, especially for  people like me (I am 82) who do need a bit of help with technology. I still have my MacBook Pro but my IPad is a dinosaur so I decided to upgrade to an 11‚Äù 2020 I Pad Pro. I really like the photo editing software on my MacBook Pro and had checked the editing on I Pads over the past couple of years and found it to be lacking and so delayed upgrading my I Pad. Now that I have taken the plunge I am glad I waited because the new 2020  IPad Pro has brilliant photo editing software and once I get used to it I think it will be even better than the MacBook Pro editing software. When on holiday (If we ever get any of those again) it means that I can do everything I need on my new IPad  I will not need to take a laptop.  I have also lashed out on the Magic Keyboard and am loving it. It is easier to take around the house than my MacBook Pro because the combined weight of the IPad and the keyboard is far lighter than the MacBook Pro. It is excellent for emails etc but my other hobby is writing and I think I will probably stay with Pages on my MacBook Pro for that because it is less sensitive when typing. But then again, I might be finding it sensitive because I am not yet ‚Äòacclimatised‚Äô to the Magic Keyboard size. It really is a great piece of equipment though. So my five stars are for Apple service, the new 2020 11‚Äù IPad Pro and also the Magic Keyboard. Well done Apple, you are the Rolls Royce of computer technology.",GB

I believed you get what you pay for that the premium price tag meant I would experience exceptional service.  THAT USED TO BE THE CASE. I was less than enthusiastic about the continuing iOS updates and how that gradually made rather good handsets obsolete.  Still as I started using more and more of the iPhone capabilities it became a part of every part of life from shopping to cooking and even exercise in some way Apple got incorporated into everything.  Then came my iPad Air which I was given as a sign-up gift for a household utility.  I was now fully an Apple user until 3 weeks ago when my iPad Pro was last updated and everything went sideways.  My device was wrecked as I could not do anything on it reliably.  It would crash looking like it was a hands free hard reset but not responding like a hard reset and starting up in 5-15 seconds opening in the standard ways.  I was given the run around about doing factory reset, delete and reload the affected apps then having to reinstall the update but for that the PRO needed help from a computer (yes, I know it‚Äôs supposed to be a stand alone portable device).  What followed was a comedy of errors, device would not backup, couldn‚Äôt get the update to fully reinstall, had a host of random errors but most of it was hampered by the fact that the device kept on restarting itself in after a few moments.  The device became more erratic after ‚Äúfixing‚Äù it was escalated and engineers advised that yes the hardware could very well have been affected by the software update but it would still be an out of warranty service in other words ‚Äúwe messed up but you get to pay for the fix‚Äù. What angered me the most of my experience was the way they kept looking for a way to blame me, flat out lying to me, the being passed around like a hot potato and the refusal to accept that their software damaged a perfectly good iPad which I have every right to expect them to repair. Yet all I got is ‚Äúwe sorry but you know it‚Äôs not covered by warranty‚Äù to which I responded that I didn‚Äôt break it your software update broke it. I then said I wanted to refer it to my local consumer disputes tribunal and would need to know whom to name as a representative.  So NO they won‚Äôt give me the a name or title. They won‚Äôt tell me what the process says just this is their decision event though the software caused me loss and damage they maintain the position that they have no responsibility to provide remedy.  In the end they violated my consumer rights and left me with the full understanding of the low standing they view people. Anyone who buys Apple can look forward to paying premium for the privilege of being treated in a manner that would leave you feeling like a class A idiot for believing their Hype. I now have an inconvenient paper weight. I was due to upgrade my phone now that they finally at long last have a product that would have suited my needs.  I will not be buying Apple if there is anyway to avoid it and there certainly are many ways to avoid Apple products.

I‚Äòve been an Apple advocate and supporter since the clamshell laptop; promoting the company emphasizing how their exemplary customer care standards and values negates the extra costs. Currently I am feeling unappreciated and extremely frustrated questioning my years of loyalty.  I‚Äôve spent countless hours dealing with unprofessional sales associates and managers trying to get my purchased delivered and when that failed fighting to get my refund processed.   On May 6, 2020 I purchased my computer over the phone with a sales associate and was  ‚Äúguaranteed‚Äù the delivery would be 5/14/2020 -5/18/2020, the delivery dates were important as I explained that I was out of town.  Within hours of the sale I received notification the delivery would be the next day (5/7/2020). Immediately I contacted Apple informing them the residence would be unoccupied until May 13, 2020, reminding them that is why I ordered over the phone and talked with a sales associate.   As of today May 27, 2020, I‚Äôve spoken to over 10 Apple employees (5 of which are on the specialty management team); spending over 8.5hrs on hold and over 3.5hrs being talked in circles . Messages I‚Äôve received from Apple include:     1.   On May 6, 2020 I was given a guaranteed delivery time frame of 5/14/2020 -5/18/2020 which was proven to be un true and later said to be impossible to do.      2.  A second call was made on May 6, 2020 and I was told ‚Äúit was not a problem, it‚Äôs a as easy as an address change‚Äù to fix the delivery date issue as I was out of state, this was also proven to be a false solution. During this phone call the associate told me ‚ÄúWow we‚Äôre in a ‚Äútwilight zone‚Äù‚Äù in reference to all of these delivery issues and the miss communication surrounding them. When the issue of what happens if the original delivery address received the computer I was told fed ex will pick it up tomorrow (5/7/2020) and we will start the refund, this promise was later proven to be untrue. (Fed-ex doesn‚Äôt do that unless I personally file for a pick up as Apple cannot...also that process didn‚Äôt actually get filed like the associate promised (5/6/2020)      5.  I was also told on later calls that the other Apple employees ‚Äúlied‚Äù to me and that in-fact they (Apple and their sales associates) held up there end and if something happens to the package (incorrectly delivered) that is my responsibility and if I was to return it I have to file a special claim and return the item personally, even after days of it sitting unattended outside my un occupied home. This call was on May 9, 2020.       6.

On May 14, 2020 I called to check on my refund as I was only given $20.00 of the $1,600.00 I spend and was told ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know why the refund has processed on one thing and not the other.‚Äù  Thing referencing the $20.00 return of the USB adapter cable I was refunded.      8.  On May 18, 2020 and May 20, 2020 I called to inquire about my refund and was told to keep waiting for your money and to call us (Apple) back in a couple days if you don‚Äôt see it.   Of the many correspondents Apple was responsible for 2 interactions, I had to reach out wait on hold for hours to speak with someone about all of these issues repeating myself over and over again each time because no one at Apple bothered to attempt to resolve this mistake on their part. Only after essentially begging for a refund and eventually mentioning calling a lawyer and making a stop payment on my credit card did I receive 2 follow-up calls.

By March it has stopped charging so i sent it to apple. They claimed the small 3mm charging appeture had sustained some kind of liquid damage. This is completely untrue as at no time was the unit submerged or in contact with any precise droplet of water entering such a tiny hole. Customer services didn't want to know as this was a ""no warranty"" issue and the only dispute method was to take to an apple store - They are all closed for the foreseeable future so no luck there. Or they could repair it for ¬£550.  I was upset about this. I spend further calls talking to senior people who have no clout or authority to do anything. In the end, I had it repaired by a UK outfit in York called Gamertech who charged me ¬£59.99 with warranty. Hang your head in shame Apple. Poor customer services, way too high repair prices.

Take it or leave is the attitude. We don't care what you think... My experience with a recent purchase left me with one option, and that was to cancel my order.  Apple made a mistake, didn't assume any responsibility for its mistake and didn't care to work to address it. Its take, quite simply; 'that's how it is' and you can either purchase or not purchase the item.

Thank you to all involved in resolving my issue so fast. I‚Äôm amazed. They even shipped the replacement before they received my return.

I have called them and asked for my options but being currently closed due to covid-19 Apple said my options were limited. I can either ship the device to them for it to get assessed then POTENTIALLY fixed then sent back which could take around a month depending on shipping which I explained I couldn‚Äôt do that as i‚Äôm an essential worker in this pandemic. Their response to this is ‚Äúthey couldn‚Äôt give me a phone to use in the meantime while that process is being done‚Äù. My second option was to call and book an appointment with one of their Apple authorised businesses that are still operating to have them look at it - then get back to apple with the issue, to then either fix it at no charge or if the issue being my fault - I pay for it. I was also told it could be caused by using too many different cables which would make the damage my fault so I then have to pay for it. The following day I then called the most local Apple authorised business being 45 minutes from where I live and they then told me that they‚Äôre booked out for the next 3 weeks and I have to call weekly to attempt to make a booking - which is almost impossible as they don‚Äôt answer the phone and don‚Äôt respond to emails. I then asked when‚Äôs the best time to call and when do they open the bookings for the next week and they couldn‚Äôt give me a day or time expecting me to call daily to get a booking and even if I got the chance to make a booking i‚Äôm currently working 6 day weeks from 6am to 4pm as an essential worker and the Apple authorised business closes at 5pm and is not open weekends; making my chances near impossible. I then called back Apple explaining that the two options they had given me weren‚Äôt good enough as with covid-19 I‚Äôm an essential service working Monday through to Saturday and my phone doesn‚Äôt charge. They‚Äôve told me they essentially could not care less. After hours and days of fighting the best option they could come up with was me paying $40 out of pocket, to send in my phone and be without a phone for days and have them return me a MANUFACTURED PHONE - not even a brand new phone!!! I am extremely disgusted that Apple is a multi-billion dollar corporation and they can‚Äôt even 1) spare a new phone for a customer who spent thousands on the phone that is STILL UNDER WARRANTY & 2) help out an essential worker who is risking their life to service Australia. Honestly considering spending my money elsewhere from now on and you should too - this isn‚Äôt how a successful business should treat their loyal and paying customers - pandemic or not they weren‚Äôt going to help me either way.

Spent hours and hours over months trouble shooting the issue with Apple Care and the Apple store. Logic board and display were replaced under warranty. The flickering issue continued (out of warranty) after these replacements and I continued to try to trouble shoot the issue with Apple. When no resolution occurred I asked for the computer to be replaced. Apple refused. Communicated with executive offices about the issue. Spent more hours trouble shooting the issue with them.

I should just trust that they will make the fix and wait it out with a computer with a screen that continues flicker.

A package from Apple, that was promised not be delivered to me by several customer representatives. On top of that, I couldn't just give it back to UPS, because return shipping was with Fedex!!! Absolutely unacceptable. Horrible experience with apple. That a package couldn't have been taken back 45 min after I placed my order is beyond my comprehension. That service representatives just hang op on me, leave chats, etc. even though I'm simply asking them to call UPS to intercept my package.  I was offered no compensation for the mess whatsoever. Since it's Thursday my package won't be returned until next week and then I'll have to wait 5 days for my refund. Absolutely horrible company. Makes billions but can't help out a teleworking customer who needs a better machine for work at home. I should have gotten my gift card payments back. Instead, I had to increase my exposure risk to the virus. Thanks Apple Update: They shipped it this morning at 6 AM. I can't believe this. The representative on the phone assured me it wouldn't be shipped. Now I have to go to the UPS store to return it, all while we're under ""stayathome"" order. The person I chatted with just left the chat, after I asked them to contact UPS to intercept the package. I am absolutely furious about this. Apple used to have good customer service. It's gotten absolutely unacceptable. Will not buy from apple again after I used my apple store card. This is a review for an issue with their customer service and their ordering options I just experienced. I ordered an iMac, but changed my mind about it and wanted to get a different one just 30 min later. So I tried to login online to cancel my order. An error occurred, so I started chatting with one of their representatives. First I asked if I can switch my order. She asked me so many questions and would not understand what I wanted to do. 20 min later when I finally got her to understand that I wanted to cancel my order, she writes ""Oooh..., it's too late now, because they already shipped it"". What the heck. In theory fast shipping sounds great. But man Apple, give your customer an hour of a grace period so we can change our order within an hour, if we need to! It was literally marked in process for shipping within 45 min. I paid with an apple store gift card, so now I can't just order a new one. No, I have to wait for my order to get here, then send it back to Apple, then wait for my refund, then place a new order. If the representative would have just cancelled my order within the first 5 min, this wouldn't have happened. I'm so upset at the inefficiency of this... I'm teleworking because of COVID-19 right now and need a better computer for data processing, since I can't work in my office. Now I have to wait probably more than a week. Yes I changed my mind about an order, but common that happens. The representative should have been way more on top of things. I called and they are processing a return and the representative on the phone literally interrupted me to just try to issue a return as quickly as possible, because she understood how frustrating that was. I think Apple should refund me immediately, instead of me having to wait for the return, because this was the fault of their customer service being so slow! Just if anyone is interested.

Had an old 2011 macbook, HD died and it was impossible to get internet recovery to work it just to get the image just to pay big dollars for them to fix it. ipads get obsolete so fast and now with them settling for how they treated the iphone users restricting its performance to save battery.

No reason for it to stop working (coincidence according to Apple that it stopped at the exact point of time of the upgrade) and no reason it started working again - Apple won't admit the upgrade caused a problem but I'm now extremely worried about any future upgrades to the system. That is nearly 2 days of me calling Apple, ¬£50 worse off buying connectors I never actually needed and a failure for links within the email for them to call me back to actually work!! NOT HAPPY and to cap it all to sort the problem going forward and not need to have a usb connection to the laptop I bought a wireless keyboard - in order to pair with the laptop it appears you need to connect it via USB to the laptop after which you can disconnect - erm that would be the USB connection they don't have on the laptop then - that would mean you need a connector to pair the two devices - that would be the connector they said not to use and which wasn't working for 2 days after their update then - erm bit of a design flaw then isn't there!",GB

Between trouble shooting with Verizon and Apple customer service, we've identified that it is likely a known Apple issue that is covered by the company, once confirmed. With all of the local apple stores shutdown for COVID-19, I have to mail it in without a loaner phone which was quoted to take 10 days to 4 weeks. Waiting 4 weeks for a phone that I use for multi-factor authentication to be able to work from home is unacceptable. I recognize that they have a number of challenges in this unprecedented time but their consumers do as well. I have to be able to work from home. I came up will a few creative solutions such as having them pay the trade in credit as if the phone was fully functional and I'd buy the newest model. If the diagnostics came back as another issue that wasn't covered by apple, they can charge my card back for the credit. Another option would be to allow me to purchase a phone and return it, if they are able to fix it under their warranty. Both options, were rejected. The only solutions involve me purchasing another phone at full price without a credit for what's likely a defect in a phone I bought from their store in July or waiting 10 days - 4 weeks for them to resolve the issue (that's after I wait two days for them to send me a box to ship it to them). This isn't an acceptable option when I need it to work from home. We own three iphones in our house (XR and two 7s that we were planning to upgrade), a Macbook Pro, and 2 pairs of airpods. For a situation where Apple could have worked with us and given me the $120 trade-in credit on a $1000 phone and even charged me back if it wasn't a warranty covered issue, they lost Apple customers for life.  The new plan is to go to Costco and buy the latest Samsung Galaxy today while they repair the other phone for me to resell online. I'm sure between the time they spent talking to me on the phone, shipping my phone back and forth, paying for an appointment at a local authorized non-apple phone repair store, running diagnostics and fixing the issue.",US

So after about 7-10 days I thought this is not something I am doing it has to be the phone annnnd then the real hell began !

It was out of warranty by this stage but still not a reliable or economical product for the price - I had to replace my computer as I‚Äôve been forced to work from home due to the COVI19 I bought a brand new MacBook Pro last week - on the first day it started to malfunction and the helpline told me the computer appeared to be faulty after they walked me through the steps to reset my new MacBook, it never turned back on - I spoke to the help line and they told me to bring it into the Genius Bar, when I got there it was closed due to the lockdown for 2 weeks. The store is not near my house so it would have been helpful to let me know this information on the phone - I went through 5 representatives before I could speak to a manager she informed me that the store was opened just for one day for existing clients who need support and told me she updated my case notes and they would be expecting me at the store if I rushed.  - I only was told this an hour before the official shutdown. Left work early, jumped in an Uber which cost me $35 to get to the Apple store on time - when I arrived they said there was no notes on my file and denied me from entering the store.  I cried and told the man at the door what had happened and he told me I was endangering everyone‚Äôs health and was extremely cold, letting other customers through for repairs.  - I called the hotline again who tried to get through to the store but was unsuccessful, they apologised for everything that had happened and promised they would do everything to help me and would call me back - when a representative called me back he said all the could do was send it in for a repairs ( in a new computer I haven‚Äôt even used yet) but I would have to take it more then 2 hours each way on public transport to have a technician look at it or wait until they reopen, which appears to be indefinite  - I told him this wasn‚Äôt an option. I spent all my saving $2000 on a new computer so I could work from home and keep my job during a scary period, if they couldn‚Äôt return the item for me even through their online store I just want to sent the faulty computer back and I obtain a refund so I can buy a computer from Microsoft - I don‚Äôt have any more saving and I was relying on that computer to keep my job. Now I have no work and Apple have taken my $2000 and left me with a faulty MacBook I can not even turn on I am just so sad that you could treat a human being like this - I explained this to the representative and when I started to cry he said I‚Äôm going to hang up now, that was the end of the call. - I have emailed the manager who promised me they would handle the case due to their poor management last week, yet I have emailed twice since then and no reply. - we are about to go into lock down, I have four more days to resolve this issue otherwise I won‚Äôt have a job next week, I have no more income coming in and now I am down $2000 Please Apple, I can‚Äôt believe this is your customer service, you have stolen my money in a time of extreme need",AU

Was told it may be covered under the extended warranty but they will have to have a person look at it so they booked me an appointment at the store. Checked in and rep said that it was no longer covered under 4 year extended screen warranty as I was 10 days past. He showed me the details that were typed in by AppleCare during our phone call. This showed I supposedly talked to a rep and then a supervisor and was told the screen repair would not be covered under warranty, and if I wanted it fixed outside warranty I would have to go to a Mac store. I told the rep that is not what I was told and I only spoke to one person. I requested they pull up the phone recording to confirm (no go ... those are only to support the company not the customer). The store rep said he can do nothing but I can call Apple Care again. I did this from the noisy store (loud music + some presentation going on at same time) and was put forward to upper support. Over the next 40 minutes I was asked questions and then told they cannot do anything as I am 10 days over. Apparently the warranty starts when you purchase the system. Too bad to me I ordered via our university portal and it shipped from China ... so I never even received the system until March. And my system showed initial file creations were March 28. Main point is if they would have told me my screen would not be covered, as they stated they did, on the phone I would not have driven 1 hour to the Store and spent 2 hours at the Store.  I switched to Mac 4 years ago with MacPro server system at work, Macbook Pro, ipad, iphone ... all under AppleCare and never a single claim. After this I am divesting in all my Apple products.

Finally after a rather aggressive attempt to get their attention and demanding my money back they offer to get the iMac checked out so the problem can be identified and a suitable resolution found. The iMac was proven to have both faulty hardware and software - so the evidence of four years of pain is clear.  Instead of compensating, replacing the faulty iMac the machine was partially repaired with a new logic board but the software issue remained.  Apple suggested that was all they were prepared to do.   I can say with certainty that whilst Apple presents as a cool and attractive brand it simply does not bear close inspection.  This is a rotten to the core outfit with draconian policies.

Steve suffers from PTSD. My uncle Steve lost his wife of 40 in May 2019 and it just devastated him, Steve never had his own cell phone. Holly and Steve did not have children and they were each others world. After Holly died, Steve realized that he needs a cell phone and he took Hollys Apple phone to Verizon to activate it. they told him without Holly‚Äôs password to the phone they could not help him and he had to contact Apple. So, last June 2019, Steve and I contacted Apple and told them the story. They i formed us that to unlock Holly‚Äôs phone and delete all her i formation ( protecting her privacy ), Steve needed an affidavit from an attorney stating there is no probate issues, also a death certificate and marriage license. Steve spent 400 dollars on an attorney for this affidavit. , we sent all the i formation in the Apple. The Apple representative told me this could take up to 6 mo ths before he would be able to use Holly‚Äôs phone. Now Steve being born in 1940 and a very practical man was not going to buy a new phone when there was a perfectly good phone ready to use, so he decided to wait the 6 months. In December 2019 I called Apple for Steve Trying to find out when he can use his phone. as his hearing is awful due to his service to our Country. I was told that they recieved all the information but Apple is very busy and they would let us know as soon as they can unlock the phone. We are in March 2020, Steve lives alone, bad hearing, diabetes, at risk for heart failure and drives to Georgia every 3 months to visit his handicapped daughter. Steve lives in NM, it takes him 3 days to get to Georgia (without a cell phone). I am his niece and bought him a phone which he refuses to use because he has Holly‚Äôs phone and that would be wasteful. I returned the Phone I bought him. I contact Apple weekly about Steve‚Äôs phone and they tell me they are working on it. Meanwhile Steve lives alone, sickly, without a phone. To me, this is a grave injustice by a company that obviously just does not care. 9 months and no news!  Steve, alone at home, no one to call and talk to AND no one to call in case of an emergency. Apple, you should be ashamed of yourself, Steve did everything you asked for, there is no good reason to take this long to restore his phone.

And in Apples care since January 26, 2020. It is February 16,2020 and I still don‚Äôt have a laptop. This might be acceptable if it were being fixed however, I was told by a senior on January 10 that there have been too serviced on the laptop for the same problem and that I‚Äôm a candidate for a replacement laptop. Should take less than 10 days to receive including my ship back of the faulty product. From this point on the process became a circus of no responsibility, lack of support, poor follow thru and constant excuses with corporate buzz words. I am now working with my third senior advisor. She just called to tell me that the factory has received my old computer. I asked when the replacement will be sent to me since the whereabouts of my old one isn‚Äôt very relevant. She couldn‚Äôt answer that and said she needs time to reach out to her team to find out ship schedule of the new computer. So, I‚Äôve been waiting 5 days for my follow up call to tell me noting. This is absolutely ludicrous. Other details that have happened are: being told by support to take laptop into a store and have them ship it to Apple since no one knew why Fed Ex didn‚Äôt pick it up. The store shipped it out and it came back days later repaired not replaced. No one knew why since the paperwork clearly states REPLACEMENT. Apple support could not answer why.  After 5 more days of waiting Apple care informs me to go to the store and pick up my old computer and Fed Ex would pick it up in several days. Why would I waste my time picking up something that was already in the hands of the place to be shipped. Apparently the store that had it refused to ship it back. After many phone calls they decided to ship it. There have been plenty of other unpleasant exchanges. Bottom line APPLE SUPPORT is hardly supportive. Apple -FAIl",US

3196,www.apple.com,2020-02-07T13:51:36.000Z,1,Rotten Apple customer service to the core,"I've been an Apple customer for over 22 years. I own three iPhones and seven Macintosh computers. I used to be a loyal and proud Apple consumer. The beginning of the end for Apple products quality and customer service began when Steve Jobs' illness left him unable to lead his company the way he originally did since Apple‚Äôs inception. Now, Apple's customer service and product quality is as bad as Microsoft. Apple always wanted parity with Microsuck, and now Apple's finally gotten its wish. In my most recent case, Apple's AirPod product never achieves its advertised talk time. I replaced the first generation AirPods I purchased because they were conking out well before their advertised talk time. After the replacement pair fared no better, I decided to pay the increase in price for the AirPod 2nd generation. Big mistake. The extra money I spent didn't buy me Apple's claimed talk time. I replaced the 2nd generation AirPods three times under warranty. The problem continued. Since I could no longer receive a refund on my original purchase, I requested that Apple permit me to exchange my AirPod 2's for the Airpod Pro. I was more than willing to pay the cost difference. Apple refused. All I could do is keep returning the AirPods until my original warranty expired. Apple sent me a complimentary new pair of 2nd Generation Airpods. I appreciated the gesture but it would have made more dollars and sense if Apple had just permitted me to pay for an upgrade and return the malfunctioning AirPods product. The most current AirPods I have still do not function as advertised.  Thankfully, I have an extended warranty from my credit card company. I am hoping its worth the time and trouble I took to file a claim. I‚Äôve been told by a representative from my credit card company that AirPod claims are quite commonplace. I am not surprised. Advice to others reading this: Never purchase an Apple product unless you use a credit card with an extended warranty program. When you call Apple Tech Support or Apple Customer Service be prepared to have a significant portion of your precious time wasted. I lost track of how many dozens of hours I have spent with Apple over the last 10 months, attempting to seek a remedy. You are likely to spend hours and hours on the phone, first with a line representative, and then with a ‚Äúcustomer relations‚Äù employee. It is highly likely that Apple will lead you down the primrose path. After soft-soaping you for an hour or two on the phone, Apple will inevitably leave you hanging. If you want to start the complaint process all over again with a new Apple customer service employee, expect to have more of your time wasted and more empty promises. And if you think you‚Äôre going to find more understanding and helpfulness at your local Apple Store, think again. They are as ineffectual, apathetic, and complacent as Apple‚Äôs phone support. I‚Äôm in the market for a new computer. Before I go out and spend another $2500 on an Apple computer product I am going to remember all the trouble and bad service I‚Äôve received on my $199.00 AirPods. If Apple doesn‚Äôt take care of their customers somebody else will.",US

Unbelievable beyond belief in this day and age!! I do believe stores have to make reasonable adjustments for disabled customers  as in she could have been seen as a priority- -  I have worked in this area for over 30 years. The member of staff then took a while asking for details previously given so someone could phone my friend tomorrow.... What a nightmare for a disabled person who was obviously in distress. All it would have taken was for my friend to be seen as a priority - not a lot to ask from such a large company. I sincerely hope no other customer in this condition has such a dreadful experience which resulted in absolutely no resolution in a very long time. She might as well not gone in today as no support and resolution apart from a phone call tomorrow was resolved.

You see, I work and I can't take an entire day sitting home while I wait for the FedEx truck.  If they would at least five me a time frame, then maybe I can work with that. So, Saturday they will try again, and guess what, I will not be home either. Basically Apple told me that FedEx has to make several delivery attempts before a ""hold-the-item-at-a-FedEx-location"" will kick into effect. That they said will be sometime next week.  So, you can understand how disappointed I am while the FedEx truck roams around town with my iMac that I wont be able to see for several days. I told the Apple representative that I was really frustrated by the situation, and that I felt extremely deceived by Apple for not advising customers of this kind of scenario.

It was in perfect condition and could have been sold or given away and made someone very happy.  I mailed it in using the provided packaging materials; however, once it got to Apple's third party trade in partner, it magically had a bad screen that didn't work correctly.

SO I sent what I had and called Apple (waited for MORE than 1 hour to get a represenative on a phone), explained I don't have such a statement and they told me it's going to be OK and that I just need to check e-mails for updates. Yesterday they sent me the same e-mail that I need to send them the documents so that they can verify and proceed with the order. Moreover, it was stating I had another 6 days till it gets cancelled. Today I received an e-mail that my order was CANCELLED! This has been the worst experience EVER! I wanted,really wanted to buy mackbook but this has been the worst experience and I can't now imaging dealing with their customer service if any technical issues would arise. It's impossible to get anybody on phone and even though you get to somebody on phone they won't give you relevant information and won't help you to proceed with the order!

Their sick idea of soldering hard drives to their machines' motherboards (here I am talking about their laptops, iMacs and Mac minis)  will result in perfectly usable units being thrown away (and pollute environment) when the hard drives die (and no matter what they die sooner than computers).  This, of course, will lead to more forced sales (long live Apple's greed!) unless the potential buyers begin to smarten up and to get the more environmentally friendly and easily expandable PCs.  I have no words to express how disappointed I am with a company I supported for thirty years through thick and thin.

It all took about thirty minutes. Phoned EE store where I bought my phone. In two minutes the assistant directed me to a lightning adaptor which I got immediately off the internet.

They are far too powerful, wield far too much financial and legal clout and  are getting away with fraudulent T+C policies every day. I had an iPhone 4s, old admittedly but working OK for what I needed. One day it offered me an update to ios 9.3 which in all good faith I accepted as I could improve on some of the apps I had. The update failed and this effectively killed the phone because the process erases the current ios. Solihull could not restore it because ""it was an old version and not restorable any longer"".They did give me technical explanation and were apologetic, and interestingly, the member of staff said if he hadn't got his working uniform red T shirt on, he could tell me things about Apple that would shock me. I therefore suggest that, because Apple have a database of EVERY phone ever made, they can see which ones are older, and then offer an update that they know wil fail, thus destroying your phone, and leaving you in the position of having to buy a new one. Well, F*k you Apple, I am not going replace with an iPhone ever. So, everyone beware of updates, they could destroy your phone. Solihull also said that when buying an Apple product, you automatically agree, in the T+C's that updating may damge the device, so they can  deny any liability for damage that occurs What a scam!!!!

The machine I wanted to trade in is in pristine condition yet they refused to take it, citing some un-evidenced point about there being spots on the screen.

All to do with T2 doing things the intel chip is meant to and Apple haven't developed it properly....yet. These bugs are with all the machines. Unsuable in a professional setting and looking online there's waves of returns already.

I visit their website, serial is part of the faulty batch. Book it in for replacement, refused as ""it was fine"". Battery expands a week later, Apple remove serial number from serviceable devices and tell me they won't touch it. Supplying me with a factory defect then a staff memeber taking it upon themselves to decide my machine is fine cause it looks clean without testing cost me a computer.

A few weeks later I realized that I had not received it yet. When I looked into it I realized that somehow they had pulled an old address from somewhere and sent it there even though I had entered my current address as the shipping address! I called Apple and was told that they were sorry, that the old address was substituted for the one I entered when ordering because I had used Apple Pay. I was then informed that they would send another to the correct address this time. Today I received an email saying that they were not going to honor that promise. I spent more time on the phone with another rep at Apple and was told that Apple Pay automatically inserts the address on file as the shipping address. I have since gone into Apple Pay and the only address I see there is my current address, not the one that they used. They are offering me no solutions aside from suggesting that I go to the house it was delivered to and ask them for it. Here‚Äôs hoping that they are honest people, and that it wasn‚Äôt stolen from their porch, which is where the courier says they left it! I will never deal directly with Apple again!

I have also been in the local Apple store and received good customer service. The issue that brings me here today is the poor customer service and online sales experience my mother and I experienced.  On 12.7.2019 my mother ordered 2, 38mm series 3 Apple watches from Apple.com.  They were scheduled to be delivered between 12.16.2019 & 12.18.2019.  Yesterday, I checked the order status and the order still showed in process.  I contacted customer support and was told they could see no issue with the order, placed a ticket to sales support and it should get the ball rolling.  Mind you, these were Christmas presents that needed to arrive before 12.24.2019.  At 5:15pm on 12.16.2019 I checked the order status again.  This time it showed CANCELED! I contacted Apple support again.  Spoke with a gentleman, explained what was going on and he stated that sales would have called to verify the purchase but if they couldn't get ahold of my mother or myself, it would have been canceled.  I received no call, email or any other message from Apple prior to speaking with them yesterday.  I explained this to the CSR on the phone.  He said he would ""seek out a manager"" but it may take a little while.  I waited.  I was on the phone, and on hold, for 1 hour 40 minutes WAITING for the CSR to ""seek out a manager"" before the manager finally picked up the call.  I'm not convinced they didn't do that on purpose.  In the meantime, I contacted my mother and told her to go to Best Buy and purchase the watches because Apple dropped the ball. I spoke with the manager, explained what I was dealing with and he apologized with very little remorse from what I could tell.  I told him had I not checked the order it would have left my mom missing 2 presents come Christmas because Apple didn't bother to communicate.  He stated he would check into it.  He also mentioned that sales should have contacted my mom to verify the order.  I explained to him no one contacted either of us.  Between them not doing what they were supposed to and leaving me on hold for 1 hour 40 minutes, this was a less than pleasing experience with Apple staff.

The promise is you can get a new phone next business day if you have to claim. THIS IS NOT TRUE. I lost my phone on a Friday. Spent 2 hours in the apple store on Saturday. Turns out you cant log a claim without authenticating to icloud. But with two factor authentication you cant do that unless you have another apple device, which I don't. The only solution they could find was to change my phone number, to my wife's number, so I start that process. The store told me it would take 24 hours.  Sunday I check status, and the site tells me I have to wait 7 days, before I can change the number, before I can file a claim, without a mobile phone. Monday I went to the apple store, and the business team were great. We cancelled the new number request because there is no way of speeding that up (which the other apple store in city had steered me wrong on this). They spent a lot of time getting creative.  I had to go to the ATT store to change my security setup, then back to apple. The only path forward was to buy a phone from the store that I would later return, do a sim change, then I could authenticate, and then file the claim. In all now pushing 5 hours on this. I file the claim Monday lunch time. Three hours later I get a request for ID apples provider Assurant for verification. I upload my id photos (which I have used with instant success on other sites) an hour later.  The next day I call Assurant and they say there is information that needs to be verified, and this can take 2-3 days from when the claim is filed. They had no information on what the problem is. I call back after 3 days from filing the claim, and they told me exactly the same thing, only now they have reset the clock so it will be Monday or Tuesday.

Because they did nothing on the first attempt and only after me prompting them they would look again. Guess what no file and it was my fault because I did not back up the phone before I updated it. Ug! They even proceeded to say I should back up before and after every up date. My next question was, where in all there tolling on what this latest up date was going to do to make my use of the phone more easy and Fun,‚Äôdid they tell us the important things like what you need to do before you start there latest up date on how to prevent APPLE from losing your data. None , just my fult for not updating . Next phone Android for me. I asked everyone I know with an android and they claim they never have an issue with up dates . I have always had a issue with apple updates in the past 5 years, but not the 8 years earlier. Mark",MX

3364,www.apple.com,2019-12-08T23:40:47.000Z,1,Poor customer service in regards to issues with iPhone X,"Apple removed this message from the forum... * Ive had this issue with my iPhone X since I purchased it in July 2018. I addressed the issue when I returned from holidays in November. They ran tests, completely reset my phone and even changed the speaker over 2 visits to the Apple store (2 hour drive away). After being assigned to Sarah from senior Apple support with the software engineers working on the issue, I was promised a fix with the software update in January. It did nothing. I contacted Sarah in Feb and she never responded to my calls or emails. Ive recently contacted Apple again and they have not helped me. These senior Apple advisors included Dan, Caleb and Shanky... again, all of who disappear after contact. Ive even tried to return it to Officeworks (where I purchased it) and they dont have a loan phone while they send mine off for diagnostics and repairs. Apple want me to do another diagnostic test, even though they have 2 from November and a video of my phone playing up. Apparently this isnt enough proof. I will upload the video to YouTube at some point over the weekend. * Search 'iPhone X message notification distortion iOS 12.2' on YouTube and you should find the video. Latest diagnostic test today showed nothing. But clearly, as shown here, there is a fault in the software. It's disappointing Apple remove messages from people who speak out about the issues and level of customer service. Hence why I'm posting my Apple review here... not on their website. Extremely disappointing.  And if you buy a phone from Officeworks (Australia) be warned they don't offer loan phones in the case they need to send your phone away for repair, even though it's under warranty.",AU

I then purchased a second apple device as a replacement for the meantime, and took the damaged one to the apple store, where I was told since it was still under warranty I would receive a new one in its place. He also mentioned that if it did happen to have water damage, I would have to pay $349 to have it replaced. It was sent to apple repair and they found that it did have water damage (even though it had not come in contact with water, and it is heavily marketed as water resistant) and that now I would need to pay $549 to have it replaced. I called ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù to ask about this, and was told there was nothing that could be done, I needed to pay that price even though APPLE was the one that misquoted me, because prices are published online. I dont know about you, but when I walk into a store and receive information from a professional at that store, I don‚Äôt expect to then have to check against that ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù. Of the 10 years I have been an apple customer, I have not once sent my phone in for a crack, liquid damage or other issue I have caused... but the one time I do, and receive false information from them and question it, I am told there‚Äôs nothing that can be done and I should‚Äôve checked online for correct pricing. On top of that, I was told the phones are not water proof, but water resistant (yes I understand there is a difference) so it was my fault... mind you, I‚Äôve had this phone for about 3 months at that point and had not come into contact with water. I would say i think they are confused about what resistant means, except their customer service seems to use resistance as their motto when it comes to ‚Äúhelping‚Äù loyal customers. While $200 may seem trivial, it is less about the difference and more about the complete lack of help and blame they‚Äôve placed on my shoulders with issues that were created by them. I have learned my lesson the hard way and will not purchase an apple product again... not that that matters to them as they‚Äôre raking it in anyways and it‚Äôs only the bottom line that is of importance to apple.",US

After the first time, I listened to all the advice on how to keep my charger from breaking and followed it. Back when I had a Toshiba computer, my charger lasted 7 years, and that was through middle and high school when I was way more chaotic and disorganized. Did not have a single issue. It seems Apple likes their chargers to break within a year of moderate use. Their prices are 100% because of brand renown, not any sort of actual quality.

Right now I am typing this on my phone as my machine won‚Äôt even start! I spend hours each day and get nothing done due to the system which keeps hanging. I have tried l, as is evidenced by my support requests made to you over the years, to work with this machine but I am just fed up and very angry at the dupe! I told your apple staff - any one and everyone i talked to, that I use Photoshop. I use Illustrator. I use Lightroom and I sometimes use them all at the same time. Give me a fast machine that will last me 5 to 7 years!!! that‚Äôs why i invested in a $3000 machine!

Finally, at the end of a 4 week wait they told me they hadn‚Äôt even begun ‚Äúmaking it‚Äù as I had requested certain features that required customization! Bear in mind I ordered it online and all custom features were recommended by your sales guy.  Finally they said they will give me a Mac 27‚Äù screen with the exact same if not better configuration. At first I was not too thrilled about the large TV size screen but the Apple manager at mall of emirates was quite convincing and I was not too happy at not having a computer to work with even after the month long wait. So it seemed like the best solution.  2017, 2018 & 2019 I have made numerous calls to your support team and visited your genius bar too - hours spent in reformatting /deleting/reloading the OS led to nothing! Finally, I just got your support to help me downgrade the iOS to El Capitan. This is the only way I could get anything done. Anyway, I continued to work with an obsolete system all the way till now - when I needed to upgrade the OS as my software won't work! So I did the upgrade two days back. The end result - this machine won‚Äôt work. none of my programs work either. The only way I can get it to work is to downgrade to El Capitan again!!!! Do you at APPLE have the integrity to do the right thing?  What‚Äôs the right thing? I want my time and money compensated.  Did you sell me a machine that met my requirements? What‚Äôs your answer?  Need to verify what I am saying? No problem. Let‚Äôs set up meeting. Happy to lug this machine to your store to take a look.  The experience with Apple has been steadily deteriorating over the years.

According to Apple reps the issues are ""software"" not ""hardware"" related. The catch, Apple doesn't apparently warranty their own software like they do their own hardware. 2 weeks have gone by and Apple is continuing to point me to work with AT&T to resolve it and AT&T is continuing to point me to Apple. (I purchased the phone through AT&T - big mistake I'm now learning is to never purchase a phone through the carrier as apparently this broken tech passing the buck thing happens all the time between the carriers and the manufacturers). Apple worked on the phone for over 3 hours and with no ability to fix it (AND, that was on day one before it ever powered up fully!!! However, it appears neither Apple nor AT&T seem to really care about fixing it as they're just letting the 14 day return policy run out so it falls back on me as the consumer to have to resolve it with my credit card company. Doesn't seem fair to me that my credit card company is going to be the one who has to pay for a replacement for a brand new phone that never worked properly from out of the box.

They have tried everything but the stupid system doesn't work. My playlists keep changing, music keeps disappearing & the playlists don't sync properly with my iPhone. I also have iTunes Match, which Apple don't support very well as they want you to go to Apple Music. I own all my own music so I don't want Apple Music subscription.

I thought it was a mistake by a friend who had sent me one of his songs to listen to, and blamed it on him. 2 days later, I received another charge, this time of 27,99 Euro. There I got angry and contacted Apple, spoke to a CS rep named Eden. After emails back and forth explaining the situation, she refunded me for both transactions and admitted that she can see i didnt buy anything and that I was in fact not a customer of them. NOW, I received another charge of 100,37 EURO last week!!!!!!! I contacted Miss Eden straight away and this time she tells me: It could be a charge from a family member or a friend using your details (still how would that be okay for me to pay for, its theft!), it could also be an old transaction charged now (no, i was never a customer) and she want me to call a security team which the line doesnt work. I am swedish and live in cyprus. the line speaks in greek only and cuts off after the person finishes what they say. I have now let Eden know again I am not, have never been, nor will ever become an apple user and that my card has been blocked by my bank and I will proceed with a formal charge back if she doesnt help me refund the money. THIEVES THAT IS WHAT APPLE IS!!!!! 3 TIMES THEY HAVE CHARGED MY CARD, FROM A PERSON WHO DOESNT EVEN USE THEIR SERVICES. I can understand a transaction here and there of 0,10 Euro. from millions of customers can be unrecognizable, but around 10, 30 and 100 euro from a person who doesnt even use their products... what the hell apple?! Youre such a huge company anyway, there is no need to steal from people!!!! Oh by the way, I was also unemployed until last week, on my second day at work this happened.

I've used Apple products personally and for my business for as long as they've been in existence. I had the original iPhone when it was released, I had the original Apple 2 as a child, the first Macintosh in college. I was expecting to trade in my iPhone as I'm enrolled in the upgrade program but was told I couldn't because my Verizon plan disqualifies me as it's not a contract plan. Why would I get a contract plan I don't need as I'm getting a phone elsewhere??? This was confusing because when I started the program I was on a month to month T-Mobile plan and what was communicated at the time in that store a year earlier was I only need to stick with T-Mobile, ATT, Verizon, or Sprint to be eligible for an upgrade, which I did. So the initial sales girl trying to be as helpful as possible got the floor lead and she, instead of trying to work things out, started off insultingly curt, disrespectful, and with an attitude that I was somehow the enemy and didn't belong in there. I will think long and hard about buying another Apple product again, I cannot support a company that treats its loyal customers so poorly and doesn't stand behind its agreements. Its shocking really, I guess Apple doesn't care about its customers anymore. There are plenty of options out there these days, may be time to put Apple in the rear view mirror I suppose, without integrity they deserve no loyalty. In my view Apple has precious little integrity left.",US

Brought into Apple Store in St Louis, West County Mall for battery replacement in Aug 2019.  After 3 hours, was told something happened to phone during battery replacement but that Apple would be giving me a ""new phone.""  Nothing but problems with phone since replacement. Found out that phone was not ""new"" but actually a ""Service phone"" or refurb.  Internet not connecting properly, then speaker/speakerphone/microphone stopped working.  Called Apple (twice), went to Mac HQ(twice) ATT (once @ Apple's request for SIM card replacement which was useless) and finally Apple Store (three times).  On the last visit to Apple, after numerous tests and 2 hours was told phone was defective - obviously- and that it would be need to be replaced again and that I was within the 90 day warranty (as opposed to the 1 year warranty which comes with actual new phones).  Then rep returned with another ""new"" service phone, peeled of the plastic, tried to connect, and then announced there was a ""problem"" and returned to the back of store.  Returned and announced that the phone could in fact now not be replaced and that it would now have to be returned for service.  I explained that I had simply come in for a battery replacement and that this was a ridiculous waste of my time and asked to speak to Store Manager.  Another manager returned and stated that there was ""nothing they could do"" and that I could either leave the store with the defective ""new"" phone or send in for service.  After much pleading, I said to send it in if that was my only option. This has been a tremendous waste of my time through no fault of my ow and is a problem created by Apple Store during a simple battery swap.  What was originally a simple battery replacement has turned into a nightmare.  I have spent close to 3 months and 30 hours in talk, drive and wait time dealing with a defective phone that I did not ask for; this was originally, 3 months ago, supposed to be a simple battery replacement of my existing, functioning phone. Apple has been disruptive.It is obvious to me at this point that Apple is simply trying to get me to purchase a new phone after already spending nearly 1200.  It is also apparent that the ""new"" phones being used in these situations are anything but.  After having all of my time wasted, promising a replacement phone and then suddenly withdrawing the offer, being sent on fruitless wild-goose chases and resets, etc etc I would like a refund of the original purchase amount and a new iPhone 11 512 GB as a replacement.",US

My device XS Max screen went black all the sudden.  After researching this it appears this has become common with this certain device.  It even has a name... ‚Äúscreen of death‚Äù.  Your device is done. It says it‚Äôs caused from a black light malfunction.  I purchased my device 5 months ago.  I‚Äôm 45 years old.  I take care of my phones.  I purchase a device and it stays in the case with a screen protector.  I was informed to take my broken device to the Geek Squad at Best Buy due to no Apple store close to me.

They said it‚Äôs a malfunction with your device and it will need to be sent to Apple for possible repair or replacement.

After day 8 of NO phone I called Best Buy to see if they have heard from Apple.  I was informed Apple needed to speak to me and they should of been attempting to reach me.  Note-  I did NOT receive one call or text OR email.  I called Apple and they informed me my device showed indications of ‚Äúliquid‚Äù damage and it would not be covered.  I needed to pay Apple $650 for repairs.  I was furious.  I informed them there was NO way it was caused from ‚Äúliquid‚Äù damage.  They insulted me by calling me (pretty much a liar)!  I asked them for proof of the damage and was told they could not show me proof.  I informed them if it was caused from liquid damage an indicator would show the damage.  I asked which indicator showed this and they could not give me that information.  WOW APPLE!!   What great customer service you have.  I‚Äôve performed extensive research on this and from what I‚Äôve gathered this is common with the XS Max with the black screen of death and it‚Äôs NOT caused from liquid/water damage.  It‚Äôs a back-light malfunction.  I informed them of this.  Told them to google this.  It‚Äôs all over the web.  Of course they disregarded what I was saying and pretty much said I could pay the $650 for repairs or they could return my broken device.  I told them to just send me my device.  I can promise Apple this.  I‚Äôm NOT done!!!   I will be contacting the Attorney Generals Office and making sure they are aware that Apple is cheating people out of their hard earned money.

3542,www.apple.com,2019-10-12T13:16:28.000Z,1,Daughters iPhone X crashed after IOS 13.2 update,"My daughters iPhone X worked perfectly before crashing after installing the latest IOS 13.2 update. After calling the help desk I was advised to connect it to iTunes via my PC to resolve the issue but it would neither update 'or' reset the phone. A fault code of 4013 kept coming up. So I booked it in and I took it into an Apple store this morning where I was told there was nothing they could do as the software was knackered unless we coughed up ¬£500!  The question is, who takes responsibility for any glitches in the updates that are potentially fatal for the phone?  The phone was purchased on a contract that I eventually paid off in full. Now I own the phone no-one will do a thing to help, fix or replace it and its not even 12 months old.  The staff member in the Apple store was so blunt, dismissive and uninterested in my problem. It appeared he was only interested in trying to get me to part with more money, attempting to upsell me to the new iPhone 11. I hasten to add my daughter 'doesn't want' the new model. She wants her beloved iPhone X or a replacement. I am disgusted with the performance of a so-called flagship model phone, the after sales service, the fact it was the update that appears to have crashed the phone and not anything my daughter has done and the fact no-one is prepared to help. It would appear Apple are just happy to see my daughter go without leaving her non-contactable in an emergency.  The whole service from Apple has been deplorable. Getting through to the help desk takes up to 30 minutes. The service advisor will keep putting you on hold (more minutes taken up) and then he doesn't call you back when he says he will to check if the update has worked. The whole experience will take about an hour out of your life that you will never get back and will only be a waste of your time anyway.  This is a blue chip, premium brand company where the customer should be made to feel they really matter. Today I haven't and I've been made to feel that all that matters is taking more money off me because of a faulty devise, made that way by a fault in their own IOS update. World domination in the mobile market is all that seems to matter (either that then its commission on their sales) and customer care has become very much secondary.   My daughter is left without a phone and I am left massively out of pocket. Shame on Apple.",GB

The cost for this was stated to be ¬£56.44. Unipart tried to charge me ¬£246 plus VAT maintaining that there was damage to the simcard holder of phone. I requested that the phone be sent back, as it had been in excellent condition when it was sent to them. It arrived back yesterday, same 'no damage' condition and working perfectly apart from needing a new battery. Therefore either Unipart has tried to defraud a customer or they are totally inept. Apple's response to the issue has been awful - the adviser in the USA put the phone down on me today. He wanted me to travel to another authorised 'repairer' 40 miles from where I live, in order to have it confirmed that there is no fault with the simcard holder. I tried to make him understand that I would not be able to make calls etc if the simcard does not work but he just did not want to know. So rather than investigate the ineptitude or fraud of the service at the Apple UK repairers the attitude of Apple seems to be to disbelieve the customer and ignore the fact that their repairers are dreadful Now I have a phone still in need of a replacement battery. The screen protector had been removed, which would not have mattered if the battery had been replaced. However, when I asked the Apple rep if they could provide a replacement screen protector in view of what has happened that was too much for him and the phone went dead.",GB

When I took my MacBook Pro which was in working order but needed support in updating its software to a new version, the technician was trying to discourage me to do any updates and promoting a new purchase which I was to consider soon but my visit was to make sure the software upgrade was done successfully. He said it will take 45 minutes which I said ok. Then said he needs to run a test to make sure the hard drive was ok which he came back and said in perfect condition and is ok to do the software update. However when he tried to run the update it failed. Then he said only other way will result in all memory loss. I agreed to that since Ive done a external backup recently. unfortunately that also failed. Then the technician said there seem to be a problem with my hard drive and he's going to take it to the back and do something to it. After about 20 minutes he come back with a dead computer saying my hard drive was bad and now they can't do anything and I should take it to some computer repair centre and replace the hard drive. I was so shocked at this. I brought a perfectly working laptop and now he's handing over to me a broken laptop saying nothing can be done. If he told me initially there is a risk of my computer going bust I would never have let him take it to the back and bring back a lifeless laptop. When I refuse to just accept it his attitude changed. Then I asked to speak to the manager oh boy why did I even ask for him. Manager or the individual who claimed to be the manager was the most arrogant rude person Ive ever come across in my entire life. I have by now wasted about 3 hours waiting and about an hour going through this horrible experience and to be told tough this is all we could do. He had no idea about customer service. He said this is a free service and they do not have to do anything else. He even refuse to listen to my side of the story. He said now its broken and we cannot do anything about it. Offered me no help or reassurance. He practically chased me out of the store saying theres nothing else he could say. When I asked how to make a complain he said even of you complain it will only come to me and I will chuck it away. I could not believe this answer. Here I am now without a laptop which I need so badly for my work and being asked to leave simply because he said he can.  He refuse to give his name and his staff member who served me. I asked them to then give me in writing what happened to my laptop and that they recommend I take it to a repair shop and replace the hard drive. I told them I prefer to do it with apple for warranty purpose they refuse to take that in too and insisted I take it to someone else saying that will be cheaper. All this asked to be given in writing and they said they'll send me an email which to date I haven't received.  We pay such a big premium to apple simply because we believe their customer support is good. However apple stores which suppose to help their valuable customers have no idea what customer service is. I have been a loyal apple customer from inception. There was a time apple had such amazing customer service but now it is unbelievable.  I was so upset and was almost in tears. When my 16 year old son saw the state I was in he got one of his friends to come and check the laptop and he restored the laptop and manage to do the software upgrade too. I cannot believe what the apple technician was trying to do. He must have thought I would buy a new MacBook. I can't think of any other reason why they said my Hard drive was bad. I would never ever go to that Apple Store in Brent Cross ever again. I will reconsider going forward wether I want to stick to apple products anymore. If this is how ordinary loyal customers are treated. We seek assistance because we are simply not the experts in technical stuff.  Apple should really train their staff about customer service.",GB

I payed extra for a warranty that they did not follow up on. What they did was literally illegal but there is not much I can do about it which is just a gross misuse of power. This has been by far the worst experience I have ever had with a company in my entire life. They constantly told me I was ok and that headphones were gonna get fixed but that of course never happened. They then said I lied about the damages which was not true and that I specifically damaged my headphones in order to get a new pair. Hopefully this sounds as ridiculous to you as it does to me. They then sent me an email saying the damages were beyond repair although there was only two minor problems that could have easily been fixed. They then sent me an email saying that the only way I was going to get back my headphones in a better condition is if I payed two hundred dollars plus tax to get a new pair. This company is abusing their power and lying to their customers. I was also told that I would be getting a call or email to follow up on this but that also never happened. Now I just got another email saying they are shipping back my product without repairing it. So I payed two hundred and twenty dollars for a pair of headphones that lasted less than six months and a fraudulent warranty. This company is an atrocity when it comes to customer service, absolutely nobody knows what to do when you ask for help.

In fact, you then have to pay hundreds of dollars to get it fixed. APPLE IS A HOAX AND I AM NEVER BUYING ANY OF THEIR PRODUCTS AGAIN. No one deserves this wasted time of their lives. This is ridiculous... I am a freshman in college and I have probably spent over 120 hours on the phone with apple in my life.

Recently I found an application I like that uses it, so I took it out, only to find that it no longer charges, has difficulties pairing with my iPad, and doesn‚Äôt work.   I called Apple support and after two lengthy conversations (they lost all my records in between), it was agreed that for the sum of ¬£32.44, they will send me another one, and I am to return the old one, or, failing to return it, will be charged in full for the new one.  Fair enough. Except, when the receipt for my payment actually materialised, what it said was that if Apple decides that the old one cannot be repaired. they will also charge me the full amount.  No option of return, and no specification of what counts as unrepairable. I called Apple (for the 3rd time), and was told that the clause is to guard them against items that have been damaged through misuse.  However, they did not agree to give me this information in writing.   Altogether, then, it all looks like a ploy to force me to buy a new pencil - of an older generation- without any return options, and against the background of the present one having failed inexplicably.  Why would I want to buy another specimen of a device which after such a minimal use has already failed? Why blocking the option to simply return?   Way to go, Apple!  Download your undesirable stock in those who were stupid enough to buy your products in the first place!

Back in 2015 when Spotify and Apple split, I transitioned my Spotify Prime billing over to Spotify because it cost me $10.91 whereas Apple charges $14.19. At this point in time, my Apple Spotify account was downgraded to a free ‚Äútrial‚Äù account and I was no longer being charged the inflated premium. I‚Äôm only now realizing, 55 months down the road, that once that trial period ended, Apple began charging me for my account that had previously been canceled with them. They chalk this up to a ‚Äúuser agreement that states that once a trial subscription has ended, you will automatically be charged for the premium account‚Äù. I have never once received an email regarding these charges. The total charges for these 55 months amounts to $780.45. After 4 hours on chats and on the phone with Apple employees and supervisors, I was told I would be credited $28.38. This is pure fraud and theft. I was never notified of these charges.

I spent hours at the apple store in order to get my phone fixed but they didn't resolve my problem. My phone kept saying ""No service"" or ""searching"" so we went to the apple store as soon as the problem came up. We spoke to one of the representatives but she said she couldn't fix it because she can't locate what the problem is and that it may be a problem with Verizon or with my campus. I go to college and it's been an ongoing problem where I couldn't call or text. Then, we went to Verizon, our carrier, and asked them what the issue is. They said it was the phone's problem. So, Verizon fixed it temporarily by switching the sim cards but the problem occurred again which is when they knew it was a phone issue.  Apparently, after Apple issued an update, it's been causing the same issues on the iPhone 7. Yet, Apple disregarded that point and told us initially that they can't pinpoint the exact problem as it could be due to Verizon or a blackspot on campus.  What frustrates me even more is that as an apple supporter and buyer, apple didn‚Äôt give us other viable options to fix my phone. The only two options they gave us was to use a loaner phone which I had to pay just to send it in or trade in for a new phone.  On top of that, I spent three weekends coming home to fix my phone and ended up buying a new phone. The amount of time I spent on trying to fix my phone made me lose the time I could have spent on anything else. If apple can create top technology, why can't they figure out an issue caused by an update? Apple is pushing updates that is making the phones that work well to not work such that they can increase their sale of new phones. I believe business can be done better than this.  My family is a big apple supporter, or at least was until now. We have three iPhones, a mac, an iPad and a tablet.

I have been buying Apple products for years but I am always mortified whenever I go into the Apple Store and I have been into quite a few of them, even while abroad.  My first bad experience with Apple was when I bought my first Mac and didn't know much about the product so pretty much accepted what they gave me as the norm. I was a little bit disappointed when I got home and found out that the Mac that I had been given already had someone else's details on it. I couldn't even set up an Apple ID because it wasn't the one that had already been set up. I didn't take it back, I just didn't bother to get anything from the App Store because the Mac was mostly for work anyway. The second bad experience was when I went into an Apple Store and the music was so loud that the assistant stood directly in front of my face and shouted the answers to every question I had asked. Other people in the store were also shouting so I came out with a really bad headache. The third bad experience was discovering that Apple products are not as safe or hacker-proof  as they claim. Having had the experience of all my data being downloaded from my Mac without even needing a password left me feeling a bit sceptical about Apple's integrity. Having tried to ask one of the assistants about it, he sought to convince me that Apple products are 100% safe and impossible to access with the fire wall. I just felt sorry for him and thought he was a bit thick and obviously knew very little about the product or he thought I was thick enough to believe him. Why would you lie to people like that? Granted that I didn't have the most recently released Mac. Fourth annoyance is that I had spent ¬£1,200 on an iPhone Xs only to discover 4 months later that they would be discontinued. No one said that they would be discontinued at the time. What exactly is the deal with that? Are the phones so flimsy that they can only really last for 1 year and Apple wouldn't have to take responsibility for them when something goes wrong? How environmentally friendly is it that we are spending thousands of pound on Apple products that we discard after 1 year? What message are we sending to young people about being responsible? This is not sustainable.  Must we all feel pressured into having the latest iPhone, Mac, AirPods etc just to be better than the Joneses? As far as I can see, nothing ever changes with the phones anyway. Just add a few cameras on the back to make people feel self-conscious because their phone doesn't look like the latest one. My most recent experience at the Apple Store was that I went in, to try and get a diagnostic on an iPhone which had died suddenly. I was told to go away for 20 mins and then come back, which I did without complaint. I was told that the technician would be able to give the charging port a clean to see whether it would charge after that and if it does then it may be a problem with the battery so we can take it from there. Obviously my phone was dead so I could not receive messages. I returned approximately 25 minutes later to find that there were still at least 10 people waiting. My appointment had been cancelled.  However, the person who booked me in again did not do it properly. I was told before I went away that I may have to wait a little bit longer in the store when I returned so I waited. People who arrived after me were promptly seen by a technician. Employees stood around chatting but no one came to see why I was still waiting. I eventually had to ask one of the assistance where the technician was up to but she couldn't find me on the list of course. I was eventually seen by a snooty woman who looked very miserable indeed. She plugged my phone into a charger, said it was charging but I knew it wasn't because it had been like that for 24 hours. She asked another ""technician"" who didn't  know what it could be. He then said they couldn't fix it because it was discontinued in the store. I asked whether they have the equipment to run a diagnostic. No they wouldn't be able to do it.  I was going to wait for a few days to buy an iPhone 11 Pro but I think I might consider looking elsewhere. This is getting beyond disgraceful behaviour.",GB

Asurion needed the phone reset to send us a replacement phone via the insurance we had on it. We could not get the phone reset because my son had changed the password. I was on the phone with your technician which was very pleasant and noligable. But we were unable to access the phone. She said we would have to go through a process that could take up to a month to complete. I elected to wait two hours to attempt to figure out the password. So she set up a call back from another technician in two hours. 1:45pm to call my cell phone. They have my cell #  I waited until 2:45 and I called Insurion to let them know I did not hear back from Apple. They decided to override the reset and send us the phone without it being reset. They advised I would get the phone on Tuesday. But shortly after they said they would send us the phone today and deliver it to us today. We would receive it between 5-7pm. I was blown away. At 6:30 a gentleman drove up to the house. Said he drove from Atlanta to our house in Morganton, Ga. An hour and a half drive. He set up the phone for us even. My son now has his phone for school tomorrow. I was very impressed with what Insurion did for us. Not so happy with Apple. I pay for three Apple phones for my wife, son and daughter.

3628,www.apple.com,2019-09-14T20:29:39.000Z,1,I had the worst experience in my life,"I had the worst experience in my life. I bought an iMac on apple‚Äôs official website on Aug 20. I had it shipped to a Fedex package center and it arrived on Aug 26 (Mon). I was out of the country at that time so only picked it up on Sept 5. Since the first day of using it, it would freeze everyday even when there‚Äôs no program running. I brought it to apple store on Sep 10 (Tue) and was told I‚Äôm out of the return/exchange window. Since then I‚Äôve been with apple support online or in person at Genius Bar for 8 times with 8 different support staff, but the issue is not resolved. First, based on apple‚Äôs official website‚Äôs description of return policy ‚ÄúYou have 14 calendar days to return an item from the date you received it‚Äù I think I‚Äôm inside the window because I only physically received the item on 9.5. Even if you count from the day it is delivered, the 14th day should be 9.10 Tue, i.e. the day I went in to return it. Second, it is a new machine and there is problem since when I started using it, so it is either that the average apple user is expected to spend weeks debuging their new product before they can use it, or this is a rare event in which apple sold me a faulty product and should give me one that‚Äôs not faulty. Third, apple support is completely incompetent and irresponsible - I have spent a whole week working with various forms of apple support and it‚Äôs no where close to a solution. They are just sending me instructions that are obviously generic, i.e. not targeted at my problem at all, and so far none of them have worked. Every time I try a new method it wastes 6-8 hours of my work time, because it takes a long time for the freeze to occur. I‚Äôve been using apple product for 10 years and am really sad to see this is how Apple treats its loyal customers. I really hope Apple higher management could take notice and reach out to me to resolve the issue.",US
3629,www.apple.com,2019-09-14T18:52:01.000Z,1,Worst customer service I‚Äôve ever experienced,"The last two days with Apple support have been absolutely terrible. The epitome of bad customer service. In fact it would make a great case study for training in how not to do customer service.  The iPad Pro I bought in May was faulty. I contacted apple support to try and resolve the issue. Agent tried to solve it over chat, but not successful so set up an appointment with Apple Genius in Leicester. I went to appointment (had to wait quite a long time) and agent at the store tested the iPad. He confirmed that the usb c port was too big, hence to iPad not charging. Rather than give me a new sealed box, he gave me what he said was a new iPad and lead, as he said charger was fine.  I went home reasonably satisfied, despite a three hour round trip and paying ¬£3.50 for parking.  When I got home I tried to set up the ‚Äònew‚Äô iPad.  It failed to set up. I was pretty annoyed, but contacted support via chat again and spent ages going through stuff which didn‚Äôt work. Very annoyed by the end. Agent set up an appointment for someone to call me next morning.  Rachel called me at 8.15 am and spent best part of an hour going through resetting. It still didn‚Äôt work. I said I wanted a new iPad, and she said that I‚Äôd need to go back to Leicester to see if they could get it working, and if not they would give me a new iPad or refund me whichever I preferred. She said she‚Äôd send me an email to confirm this. So I did the 3 hour round trip with ¬£3.50 parking again, this time with my husband to support me.  Agent Tom said the replacement iPad I was given the previous day was NOT new, but a used spare. He also said he couldn‚Äôt give me a new iPad. I told him Rachel said I would be given a new iPad or a refund, and Tom said he couldn‚Äôt do that. I checked my email and saw that her email didn‚Äôt say I would be given a new iPad or refund. So she had lied to me.  I quoted the Consumer Protection Act to Tom and he said the manufacturer wasn‚Äôt responsible it was the retailer. He said he couldn‚Äôt  give me a new iPad, only another used one. So i asked for my original iPad back (which had only been replaced the day before) so we could go to PC World, as Apple had confirmed it was faulty. Tom said it wasn‚Äôt in the store any more. We suspect some other poor sap has been given it as a replacement and is probably now going through the same terrible experience as me.  Fortunately I had the email confirming my original iPad was faulty and had been replaced, so we drove for an hour plus to PC World in Grantham where I had purchased the original iPad. The chap at PC World was great and refunded us. I can only deduce that the reason I wasn‚Äôt signposted to the retailer straight away is that Apple know that they would have to refund / replace, and by stringing me along with shoddy seconds they may be able to avoid the cost.  If I had been told from the start that Apple wouldn‚Äôt be able to replace the iPad with a new one, I‚Äôd have gone to PC World straight away - it‚Äôs only 20 mins away from home and free parking after all. Instead I was strung along, told I‚Äôd been given a brand new iPad by two people then told it wasn‚Äôt new by Tom, told I would be given a replacement brand new iPad or refund by Rachel, then told by Tom I wouldn‚Äôt... As a long time Apple user and keen proponent of the Apple ecosystem, I am truly appalled by this experience. I have a MacBook Pro and iPhone, but when they are due for replacement am now considering Linux / Ubuntu. The Apple ‚Äòsupport‚Äô staff have clearly been trained well in dodging difficult questions and absolving Apple of responsibility. There was no attempt to offer recompense for the 8 plus hours I have wasted and fuel and parking costs I‚Äôve accumulated trying to resolve the issues. It has been the worst customer service  I‚Äôve ever experienced, and at 53 years old I‚Äôve suffered some pretty awful service. I have chosen to pay a significant premium for Apple products, yet the after sales service is worse than cheap scam companies.  It‚Äôs such a shame, as Apple‚Äôs products are generally great; this is the first issue I‚Äôve had in 10 plus years (other than accidents that have been my fault) and boy has it left a sour taste about the brand.

Indeed you do get caught up in a web of products and get so deep in their ecosystem it's hard to get out, but it can be done. I am a techy and have always viewed Apple products the best of the best.  Not any more - when their Sapphire Crystal glass on the Apple Watch series 4 cracks at the smallest of bumps, and they treat you as an, and I quote, 'Apple Customer' rather than a person (this was how they addressed me in response to an official complaint), I was ready more than ever to switch providers.  In a way, Apple have done me a favour by selling me a duff 'toughened glass' watch and getting their impersonal robots to answer complaints, because now I have one of the best Android phones on the market and am discovering a whole new world of apps and tech that I could never have imagined in using Apple's stuff. I buy all my gadgets outright almost as soon as they're launched.  I have sold my iPhone XS Max but still have their Airpods, Apple TV, Macbook, iPad Air, iMac and Homepods.  I'll slowly be switching to alternative products for these but for now I'm happy I've moved to Samsung for my phone.  Hear it now people - Apple just don't care about you, they just want your money.  They claim to sell the best quality in their products but clearly don't.  I can't wait for the day when their business model begins to fail and is evident for everyone to see.  Needless to say they wouldn't do anything for me with my watch and said it was my fault.  I think they could look at each case on it's merits rather than have a blanket policy.  They could have made an exception for such a loyal customer.  Not happy Apple - not even interested in waiting for your next iPhone launch.",GB

The next day they confirmed it was faulty/dead so agreed a replacement. None in stock, so would have to order one and I would get an email on Monday advising when it would be in store to collect.  Monday came and went. I will give them another day- then Tuesday came and went! I called via central numbers as no number for the local centre is available! They could not give me an update- no informatioon avaiolable to them!  Seriously, a tech company like apple, has to have people ring through from one country to another to see if anything has been done?  There is no system update they can check that tells them the status of the replacement order?? The first was a call from USA, I gave up after 35 mins being on hold, the frustation was too much! I tried again. The next call was to an 0800 number, turned out to be a guy in Athens, he again wanted to keep me on hold while he tried to ring my local store!  I was shocked! I asked for a call back & he reluctantly agreed to ask if someone from the store could call me back if he got through!!!! There website and systems are not customer friendly at all.

Jason would not give me his surname or any further Apple ID. He accused me of being rude to him. I certainly was ‚Äòdirect‚Äô in my approach, but did not raise my voice or use any bad language. Apple‚Äôs whole ethos revolves around customer service. The service I received today, was recorded and was the worst I have ever received in a retail environment. It was arrogant, unfocused, unhelpful and incredulously poor. I purchased an Apple iphone XR, blue for ¬£799 in person at Apple Store, Intu, Watford on 25 April 2019. Strangely the service I received that day, was impeccable. A technician ‚Äòon hand‚Äô to download and change over my data from my old iphone 6. I have been having ‚Äòexperiences‚Äô of my new iphone   getting hot when it is processing, and on a visit to Devon at the weekend using ‚Äògoogle maps‚Äô, it got so hot that I could not hold it. It worried me as it would anyone. My first opportunity to return the product to store was today. Tuesday after the Bank holiday Monday. Jason the ‚Äòstore manager‚Äô / most senior staff member, apparently, took my enquiry. This is how it unfolded: 1) We don‚Äôt have any technicians here today (3.30pm) to have a look at your phone. 2) You can come in to a walk in tomorrow, with luck there ‚Äòmay‚Äô be someone to look at your phone. 3) Alternatively we could arrange a fixed appointment, but the earliest possible is Saturday. 4) I was extremely annoyed. Said I‚Äôd not paid ¬£800 to get no service. Said my business relied on the product. The product is under warranty. Expressed anger and annoyance; asked to see a more senior person. 5) Was told a more senior person ‚Äòexisted‚Äô but was not ‚Äòin‚Äô or ‚Äòavailable‚Äô 6) In the meantime another customer standing close by had come in and had clearly had a simple diagnostic check on their device, clearly without appointment. Several technicians were happily available when ‚Äòsales‚Äô took place. None could be found for me it seemed. 7) My round trip from home/business is 25 miles. My afternoon had now been wasted. When the ‚Äòphone was sold to me I was told to return in store ‚Äòat any time‚Äô with any problems and ‚Äòthey‚Äôll be sorted out immediately‚Äô. The Apple warranty is written similarly. 8) In ‚Äòutter disbelief‚Äô, I asked the same manager, as he stood in front of me for the apple help line number: 08000480408. I spent 1 hour and 14 minutes on that support line ‚Äòphone number in The Watford Store with this Store Manager Jason standing in close vicinity, watching this charade unfold. The two very helpful operatives at apple support centre/overseas, showed complete dismay at the way I was being treated. They raised a formal complaint as numbered above. They suggested this was all they could do in the circumstances. When I handed the ‚Äòphone to the store Manager, (three times), your call centre managers were similarly unable to get any common sense out of Jason. 9) The ‚ÄòManager‚Äô Jason made no effort to help or intervene. He even had the audacity to say to his colleagues over the ‚Äòphone that the store was ‚Äònow closing‚Äô. I‚Äôd arrived one hour and forty five minutes earlier. The Apple support members apologised continuously and profusely for their colleague‚Äôs behaviour. (Please listen to the recorded call). In addition your call centre colleagues even suggested I could, with their instruction do a diagnostic check with instructions over the ‚Äòphone myself. It didn‚Äôt work out‚Ä¶ , but, Jason standing by didn‚Äôt even offer his help. 10) Finally, I left the store having secured an appointment on Monday. As I left, Jason had the audacity to suggest to me that if ‚Äòmy problem‚Äô was ‚Äòso urgent‚Äô, I should take my chances and call in tomorrow morning, on the possibility a technician ‚Äòmay‚Äô be available. As I‚Äôm a pilot with a schedule I said no it won‚Äôt be possible. In the interests of safety, if the phone heats again, I will pop my sim card in my old Nokia analogue phone. Thanks Apple, you‚Äôve demonstrated a complete and utter lack of product back up. The staff in my business are almost certainly going to be changed over to other phones. Apple is expensive, because it is supposed to be well supported and guaranteed. This experience has been appalling. 11) Apple: I need my phone tested for safety reasons. I‚Äôve noticed it is not processing as fast as it did when I bought it AND it‚Äôs overheating. I also need to be compensated for a wasted afternoon, and the repeat trip which will be a further morning, I also need product repair/replacement if faulty. I also need to understand why you employ staff like Jason‚Ä¶ He has completely let the whole Apple Team down. He is a disgrace and should be disciplined. He‚Äôd have no place in my organisation, I would sack him without hesitation Yours Sincerely,",GB

An appointment to have the problems analyzed at the local Apple Store proved to me that the staff is trained to ignore the true needs of the customer and to lie as much as possible to sell, sell, sell. Short story: advised that a battery replacement would not fix all the problems that ""might"" be hidden and they supposedly looked up my account at Verizon and told me I was not eligible for a upgrade and that they were offering a new phone at the same price as Verizon.LIES.  Next falsehood: it will only take about 30 minutes to transfer data from old phone to new.  Two and a half hours later I walked out with a new phone that I was told couldn't accept all my personal texts from the old phone - so I lost pictures and comments regarding my husband and family - FOREVER. And it cost me almost $400!!  I told them about my loss and that I had another appointment in two hours when the first tech greeted me. That's another thing - I had four ""techs"" trying to get this transaction completed..and each one of them had to request assistance at every step.  My family is far more educated in this than I and they tell me that had I had an advocate with me, these ""techs"" would have never taken such advantage.

I walked into a store yesterday and walked out with a fixed phone 15 minutes later and it only cost me ¬£32. The repair was done whilst I watched and was professionally undertaken.

The arrogance of Apple as an organisation, as represented to me, by this ""manager"" beggars belief. The inconvenience (and cost) incurred all as a fault of Apple and not even a gesture of compensation - not even to cover the most basic expenses - no surprise to me, now, that their revenues are falling.

I called the original number and they told me that a screen in the earbud was pushed in so it was damage not covered.  I asked them if this was the reason they wouldnt charge and they no but that it didnt matter as the pushed in screen voided the warranty regardless of the issue with them not turning on or charging.

In April 2019 my iPhone SE (purchased in 2016) battery needed replacing, which was fair enough due to the age of the phone. I went to our local Apple store at the Bluewater Shopping Centre, Kent, UK and they replaced the battery for a fee of ¬£45.00 and a 90 warranty.  At the end of July 2019 I noticed the screen of the iPhone had started coming loose from the right hand side of the phone and was pushing up. I went back to the same Apple store with my concern. They said it was definitely a swollen battery, but as it was now out of warranty I needed to pay a further ¬£45 for a new battery, but that the phone needed to be sent away for repair. I was a bit taken aback that the replacement battery had only lasted 3 months and that Apple were totally unapologetic about it and quite adamant that a further ¬£45 needed to be paid. They sent the phone away and I got a loaner phone from them. BUT, what added insult to injury is that when the phone was returned from the repair centre I was charged ¬£125!!!! This was for a replacement battery and screen. At no point was I called or emailed to advise me that the bill would jump from ¬£45 to ¬£125, at no point was I asked if I wanted to go ahead with the repair or not! I was stunned at their assumption that this was ok and that I‚Äôd have the money readily available. The lady at the Apple store said she couldn‚Äôt knock off any money when I raised my complaint. She said the repair centre is a separate entity to them and I‚Äôd have to pay. Update -  I later raised my complaint via the ‚Äúhow did we do?‚Äù survey sent to me on email, and was called by one of the Bluewater Apple store managers the next day (Wednesday), who said he would look into it and come back to me in the next few days. By Saturday I still hadn‚Äôt heard back from him so decided to go back to the store. . . The manager on duty (not the person who called me) was very apologetic for the grand error and said I was only the second person he knows of that this has happened to.

3719,www.apple.com,2019-08-06T00:11:10.000Z,1,AppleCare Advisors,"Be aware that when you call an Apple store or Apple support of ANY kind, you are NOT actually speaking with anyone who works at or for Apple. You must go into the stores for that. Apple outsources its customer service to a company called Concentrix (who is currently being sued in the state of CA for major violations). Your call to the store gets rerouted to Concentrix, a company that employs people to work from their homes. This means any data you give Apple can be accessed by Concentrix employees who have no oversight. They can steal your data and the data of anyone in your household such as your address, credit card info, your child's info, etc and no one would be the wiser until it was too late and even then most people would not think of Apple as the culprit. Please note: Concentrix/AppleCare employees have ZERO hands on experience with Apple products unless they happen to own one personally. They are trained remotely for a few days then sent out to assist you. This is why they know nothing when you call for help. They put you on long holds because they are searching Apple's forums for a solution, something you can do yourself at Apple.com without putting your data at risk. Advisors use the same lines to make you trust them but they are following a script that requires them to use what are called the 3 A's (Acknowledge {the issue}, Align {with customer's feelings}, Assure {customer you can help}). Often, AppleCare advisors are taken from any of Concentrix's other client accounts like Nike or TurboTax then thrown on the Apple account almost as an afterthought. These advisors are so low on the chain-of-command they are not privy to releases until the public also gets it. Next time you call Apple, ask the advisor if they are working from their home or better yet, just listen to the background. There will be no noise like there would be in an actual call center. If you have an issue-go to the store itself or when an advisor answers, tell them to transfer you directly to the store. The way to get their attention and an appointment STAT is to use the words ""hot"" or ""warm"" when describing your device, even if it is not. Advisors are instructed to get customers to the store immediately if they hear those keywords. I hope this helps lift the veil of secrecy many company hide behind while their customers are left vulnerable.",US

After that, I immediately contacted IDIGITAL, which is your representative in Israel, that's how he presents himself. I had to pay them $ 25 for they would move the device to their laboratory.  After two more days, I got a quote from them for a repair that is 1130$ Which is 1.5 times the price they sell for such a new device! They say that water may be spilt on the device. 1.	No water is spilled on the device and I am ready to undergo a polygraph test. 2.	Even if somehow the device comes into contact with water the device should be water resistance in the IP67 standard.  After that I spoke with the manager of IDIGITAL, whose name is Roi, I borrowed his last name and he replied that there is no family name only ""Roy Manager"". He said that if I wanted I could send the device myself to APPLE's lab in the United States and maybe they would fix it. From this I understand two things:  1.	Sold to me a defective device. 2.	Your representatives in ISRAEL do not accept Manufacturer's warranty of APPLE, Worse, they try to cheat on people and steal money from them.

When I called Apple to ask what my recourse was (since the 14 day return policy had passed), I was told that a store near me was sometimes flexible in their return policy and sometimes accepted returns outside the 14 day period. This did not turn out to be case. So the customer service also wasted my time. I now have a $1,000 hunk of junk that I am even having difficulty selling online.  I now use my old MacAir--no problem.

Clarifies that no matter how small the issue it would be this amount and could only go up unfortunately if damages were bigger.

I was a different state on a business trip and my phone battery completely died and was no longer responding to a charger. I was actually within walking distance of an Apple store so I went on over expecting to get in, pay 50 for a battery, and get out. Unfortunately, I needed my Apple ID password in order to even start the process for some reason. After using touch ID for several years- of course I did not remember the password. Oh what a huge problem that was. Not only did the demeanor of the sales rep change to where he was talking down to me saying that it was my responsibility and he has done his part but I did not do mine, but he gave me little to no options of how this problem can be resolved. He told me pretty much to come back in 2 weeks when i have a password and we can continue...... By the way I was peaceful and polite the whole time and on the verge of tears while this man shows no sympathy and was dealing with me as if I had just threatened him. Anyway, I have no phone right now and I have another business trip flight in 3 days. I have no way to communicate with anyone and I am waiting for account recovery. I thought that maybe if I called and explained my situation that would help things. I got the SAME EXACT HORRIBLE TREATMENT on the phone once I told the representative that I did not have my password. At least she gave me more options of moving forward. She needed some code that is apparently written on the SIM card slot. It wasn't. So now I not only have a dead phone that I can do nothing about... I also have a jammed SIM card that I must get removed. I never thought I would ever say this.... but I am switching to Android as soon as possible. I will never be with Apple again. Never.

And I‚Äôm not even the biggest Apple fan in my family.  But I‚Äôm honestly this close to switching. Apple has begun putting in updates that make their software needlessly difficult to use. If there is one thing I cannot stand it is feeling out of control and completely helpless to try and understand what the f*** is going on. Additionally, everything is now automatically put on the cloud. And we have no way to stop it. I have a serious data struggle and do not want to have to download my books from the cloud over and over. But alas when I tried to turn off iCloud for iBooks all my files disappeared with it. Even the ones I had re-downloaded. This is a load of bull. Itunes on my pc no longer recognizes my iPhone 8 but it auto downloads all my music without asking permission. Another drain on that very limited internet access I mentioned. Additionally, my cloud is now full with s*** I never wanted there in the first place and the wonderful Apple platform is consistently trying to bully me into upgrading my storage for the *low low price of one kidney.* please note not actually but I‚Äôd probably have to sell a kidney to afford this nonsense. I bought the phone with the bigger storage capacity SPECIFICALLY for this purpose and now I‚Äôve had that option taken away from me. I‚Äôm tired of this platform being made so difficult to use that the ‚Äòfriendly‚Äô is gone from user-friendly and I would like to have control over my device and how it stores things returned to me. Feeling very disillusioned and honestly hope Apple realizes how fast they‚Äôre losing customers and that they cannot actually afford to f*** us around like this because they aren‚Äôt actually all that great or leading the market or whatever.

I recommend that if someone has absolutely no other choice; being a significant financial burden to switch to PC, to buy refurbed and run from Apple Care. It is simply not worth the money. If switching is an option, consider other options. When Steve Jobs was CEO of Apple, the company was great; at least from a consumer's perspective. Today, they are far less caring. The equipment is far less reliable, and the customer service rep is far less able to resolve problems. The representative tried her best to help me in all fairness, but Apple policies tied her hands. She is a manager in a multiple $billion dollar company and could not make an $80.00 decision. I don't blame her at all, and thank you for trying Wendy.

They did not provide any proof of that, they just took some pictures of the outside, with some marks on it, - which have nothing to do with a keyboard at all. When I called Apple - though it is their authorised repair shop - they said they take no responsibility for their actions and are not going to help me at all. This is the Apple expensive service for which we all pay when buying their stuff. So no Apple for me, from now on (though I have already a lot of stuff from them at home).",NL

I appreciate due diligence, especially when more folks are using ApplePay et al, or if you have terrible people who are trying to get into your phone or something. My qualm is not in the level of security, but how inflexible it is. In my case, I downloaded a work-related app on my personal device that required me to change my iPhone's passcode last Thursday. I found the app's demand odd, and at first thought it was prompting me to create a passcode for just that app. I use Touch ID 99% of the time to access my iPhone, so did not catch the newly created passcode was in fact that for my entire phone until one morning my iPhone prompted me for my passcode over and in lieu of the usual Touch ID. From here it was game over; despite full knowledge of all my credentials and a valid Touch ID, I could not remember the last 2 digits of the new 6-digit passcode. I tried multiple times to no avail, tried in vain to back up my phone using my MacBook (it wouldn't let me without unlocking the device, read every article and contacted Apple Support, who told me recovery was the only option. There was no 2-factor authentification or using any of my other credentials to work around this; it was passcode or bust. Well, I don't pay the extra money for cloud storage of my photos, so over a 6-digit Thursday mistake I lost so many family photos I can't get back. I understand forgetting the new passcode is my fault. But I wish there had been some flexibility or mercy, an opportunity to provide the 99% authenticating security information I did have.

They sent the phone back and charged me $300 on top of the $599. They also were supposed to contact Verizon and let them know my new device agreement was with them. That didn't happen either and Verizon is still charging me for the phone that apple charged my account $300 for! They then tried to tell me that the only resolution was for me to send everything back to them and then they would give me my money back. Take the 7 plus to some store, pay to get it repaired and then they would try the trade in value again. What the hell!? I explained that i'm a small business owner and that doesn't work for me because I run my business entirely from my phone. I was on the phone for 3 hours with them. 3 hours! All i wanted was the $300 back that they charged my account for because the inital agreement was for $599.

The repair center was still 1 1/2 hours away. I contacted apple support who uploaded diagnostic files from my phone. The technician said the battery was definitely bad and should have lasted longer. A day later the support team told me to take it back to repair center. I explained the 1 1/2 hour drive and that I needed to know it would be taken care of. They never replied. I went to repair center. They agreed that my new battery was bad, but would not repair it for free because they said apple would not reimburse them for parts beyond 90 days. I got charged $80 to get this defective battery replaced. I sent apple support an email telling them what happened along with my wasted 1 1/2 drive. It has been complete radio silence. So I believe apple thought the repair center would cover the cost. The repair center knew apple would try to stick them with it. In the end, the customer got stuck. Two lessons learned. 1. Apple‚Äôs declining iphone sales has caused them to become predators on the service side. Not, a top choice in the next phone replacement for my family. 2.

Yet when i filed my trade in order was on apple website, the quote was from apple website, and not once was this company Phobio mentioned as part of my trade in process.  Apple swiftly washes their hands ,and refused to further discuss my issues. Would i have known is not Apple directly handling my trade in i would of have done more research into the credibility of this Phobio company.

Yet i feel like a ball being tossed back and forth between Apple and Phobio without any of them taking responsibility to pay me what i was quoted for my macbook air which worked perfectly when i mailed in to them.

No, I do not work for Apple but I might as well as I am a champion of your products. I work in the small business technology consulting industry (help desk support is a large part of it).  I sit here on my MacBook Pro with my iPhone XS Max, AirPods, iWatch, iPad and my iMac is in the other room.  I am everything Apple and I purchase new all of the time. Therefore, the trade in is critical to me staying current and wanting to keep buying your new products. I recently purchased the newest iPad (over a grand) and traded in my not-so-old iPad.  It was estimated at $400 trade in which was great. Helped me justify a 1K iPad purchase. I received an alert that the iPad had a bend in the frame (a known Apple defect - as I did not bend it) and they took off $50 from the trade in. However, your trade in partner claims they told me the trade in value was $0 and that I ""accepted it.""  I whole heartedly would never have accepted $0 for a relatively new, good working iPad.  Even if I did accidentally accept $0 (which I know, whole heartedly I did not), there has to be something you can do to assist me. I feel as if I have been robbed of $400.   I will say that the agents I spoke to on the phone were excellent and this is not reflective of their level of support. This is a flaw in the trade in system. I don't know what I want here.

I got an email saying that they would pick up the watch. I also, the same day, got an email saying that based on what I had told them the watch would be repaired under warranty, which I thought was excellent.  When the repairers assessed the watch they said that I would have to pay ¬£238.70 + Tax to get it repaired because there was damage that I had not mentioned in the original repair request and included a photo of the scratch that I had told them about. I immediately contacted them and explained that this was not the case and directed them to the transcript of the conversation as provided by the guy that I had the online chat with. They said that if I had phoned them instead of talking to the online adviser they would have told me that the repair would not be covered by the warranty. I was initially prepared to pay to get it repaired but was shocked and disappointed at the way they went about it (especially after being told that it would be repaired under warranty). Apple have now closed the repair request and are sending the watch back to me.

Over the last 10 years, my wife and I have equipped ourselves with a range of Apple devices, having been attracted by their ease of integration, and the simplicity of transitioning from one device to another when replacing them. But this recent experience has made me reconsider this. I just replaced a 6 year old iMac (a desktop Mac) with another, new iMac. What was supposed to be a very straightforward migration of data, applications and settings from one machine to another turned into a nightmare. After a full day of failed migration processes followed by successive calls with Apple support staff (many of who were quick to lay all blame at my feet and couple of whom added to the aggravation by dropping their calls), finally a senior level (tier 2) Apple advisor determined after consulting with several of his colleagues that the issue stemmed from a botched warranty repair on the original iMac (replacement of the screen when it failed a few months after purchase). It turns out that the Apple repair crew had used an unorthodox work around when they put in the replacement screen. After finally identifying the problem, it was also confirmed that this work around was a ‚Äòdone-deal‚Äô and we could not set up the new iMac with the normal migration process drawing on the data, applications and settings ‚Äì either from the old iMac itself or from the backups on our Apple AirPort Time Capsule. We then set about taking the data and applications a file at a time from the most recent Time Capsule back up ‚Äì a laborious process and somewhat nerve-wracking as one is having constantly to double check you got everything and one is never quite sure. And there were numerous glitches and retracing of steps required. And for three days I had to put the rest of my agenda on hold with successive calls, screen share sessions and waits for call backs from Apple staff. There were a couple of the Apple tech support people who were particularly helpful and were also quick to recognize Apple‚Äôs part in creating these issues.

My most recent experience has made me never want to purchase another product. I purchased a MacBook Pro in 2012, which wasn‚Äôt cheap, but when spending $2100 on a computer you would expect it to be quality. Boy was I wrong. The laptop all of the sudden would go to a gray screen when turned on and wouldn‚Äôt load from there. I looked up the issue online and found that this is a common issue with the 2011/2012 model of the MacBook, and Apple actually faced a class action lawsuit in 2014 over the defect, in which they offered out of warranty replacements from 2015-2016. When I brought it to the Apple store they ran a diagnostic test and confirmed that it was the defective video card. The Apple Genius informed me that the company considers my laptop obsolete and they no longer make the part so there are no options for repair. He immediately recommended that I just purchase a new laptop. Why would I ever want to buy another MacBook from a company that considers the device obsolete after 5-7 years and won‚Äôt even fix it if you pay the out of warranty repair price. All buyers beware any Apple product you own will be considered obsolete 5-7 years after release and will not offer any repair options after that point. There used to be a time where they would repair any model of any product but those days are long gone.",US

Match the serial number to the box they hand you. I was tricked into thinking I was buying a New IPHONE.   A reasonable assumption when you point to the display case where the phones are shown and tell the Apple CS rep that you just want to replace with the same style IPhone. YOU are led to believe that you are getting a NEW Iphone not  refurbished one. Here's what  the AppleCS representative did to me. She told me she needed my phone to transfer my data to the new phone. She has me sign on line - what I missed in print was ""new or refurbished"", She then transfers the information in the back so you don't see them opening a new box. Then she walked out and handed me a new box with someone elses serial number and new ear plugs. I didn't think much about it because they are handing you your purchased phone and a new IPhone box.  So naturally you think you're getting a new Iphone. Very misleading. There's no sticker marked telling you it's a trade-in refurbished phone. viewer site. The sales person was super sweet and knowledgeable so I trusted her advice. . She had me sign online for my receipt and as a normal person - you scroll through several pages to accept. But In small print what I signed was the comment  new or refurbished. I would have never bought a refurbished phone. I was expecting a NEW PHONE. I didn't catch this until a few months later  I noticed the serial number didn't match in my phone.  When I tried to resolve it by contacting the Walnut Creek Store - they hung up on me, they put me on hold till I finally gave up holding. I also tried to resolve it on line with  Apple support and they could care less. Basically, I was blown off by the CS supervisor because I signed on line.  I would have never, never, never, never dreamed I would point to the phone shown in an Apple display case and have an Apple representative walk out with a NEw  IPHONE Box & Earplugs that tdidn't match the IPhone I was getting. I wasted a lot of time getting no where.  I finally gave up.  My recommendation is ALWAYS check your phone before you sign online to see if it's actually brand new and that you're not getting a trade in refurbished one. Shame on Apple. Now I better understand why the  CS representative said she could dispose of my damaged IPhone. Now I know what they do, they use your damaged phone and refurbish it and sell it to someone else. Just appalling. In retrospect, I should have gone to the CBS or NBC""news"" where they help you when there has been an unresolved problem.",US

Customer service.  Over and over millions of purchases happen at Apple. And over and over, they are hidden from the public eye after the purchases have been made. They have perfect responses on how to tell you ""we don't do that."" I do not mind a ""no"" when I am out of bounds on requesting too much of a company or requesting something they simply cannot accommodate. When it comes to spending thousands of dollars on these products, they are quick to be smiling and helpful when your debit card is sliding. Right up until you need something in return. (A question answered, to speak to someone on a specific issue, etc.) Try to get in touch with an Apple agent. Find an email online for support. You will not easily find it (if at all.) They are completely inaccessible except for when you are making a purchase. I am not asking for much.

It still worked but I got sick of looking at the cracked glass.  So I bought a Fitbit Versa Lite and it is fabulous.  Much better and 1/2 to 2/3 the cost.   But why I'm writing the update is that I found out Why the Apple watch dropped and broke.    The charger for the Fitbit wraps around the watch and clamps down so it won't fall off the charger.  That was the problem with the pretty white circle Apple watch charger.   It doesn't adhere to the watch and the watch can be knocked off the charger very easily.   A really BAD design Flaw.   It look great but works like...... Apple, you should stand behind your product.   Original review: Used to be a good company. Now a bunch of unaccountable, price-gauging, inferior product-making thieves.  -- my sentiments exactly. The Apple Watch series 4 is advertised as the ultimate sports watch.  My watch face completely shattered after the watch fell off the charging station, about a 40 cm fall.   Falling off a table at 40 cms  does not compare with wearing an Apple Watch while kick boxing, playing soccer, practicing martial arts or playing USA Football.  A sports watch, an expensive one at that, should not only stand up to the rigors of the above mentioned sports but also should survive a simple fall off a table. We purchased two Apple Watches for Christmas presents for about  $950 USD.  The watch face of a sports watch, especially an Apple product, should last more than 5-6 weeks.   We are long term Apple users and currently have 2 ipads, 2 ipods, 2 MacBook Air and 3 iphones, along with the new Apple Watches.  All these other products have lasted and survived the rigors of normal daily life. I requested that they replace the crystal facing and they said no.  I had to buy a new one.   Why would I buy a new watch for $400 if the first one broke in 5 weeks.  This is surely a defect in the watch face.  Something is wrong with the facing to crack and break after a small fall off the table. As a long term Apple customer I am shocked that Apple goes not care about customer loyalty.   They have gotten way too big.   I currently have the watch wrapped in cling wrap and when it finally dies I'm going to buy a FitBit watch for 1/2 the price.  And when I need a new phone I'm going to buy a Samsung--again for less money.   We do not need Apple anymore. Below you will see some of the advertising material that describes the Apple Watch.  This is what we read before we purchased the watches.   If the website had said, ‚Äú be careful, the watch is very delicate, don‚Äôt let it fall 40 cms‚Äù then we would have saved our $950.

So Many people don't buy apple because of the lack of a jack and i somewhat wish i didn't because it means i can keep using my phone when it needs charging and use any earphones i would like to or even never have to touch a pair of earpods again. Top tip-Before buying, ask yourself 'Do i truly want this?' Because it seems like im stuck for 3 years with a phone that honestly ruins music just because of the sole fact i cant use a decent pair of earphones. although the speakers on the phone seem good i cant really have songs blaring out at 2;14 in the morning. #BringBackJack OH by the way forgot to mention you are paying more for less literally... If anyone from apple reads this (HAHAHAHA NO) remake the 5c with more storage. it was small, works well, good quality,indestructible and HAD A JACK. id rather pay ¬£1200 for a remade 5c than 1200 for an iphone xs.",GB

Bought the iPhones 6s in Alberta Canada in March 2018 , after few months screen stopped working, called customer service and they couldn‚Äôt fix it and they refer me to Market Mall Calgary, Canada Apple service centre. They looked at the phone and said it has hardware issue . They have to replace it in September 2018 and during that time they told me to wait for approximately 2 hours. After 2 hours they returned the phone to me. Worked for 2-3 weeks and then same issue. My wife threw this phone away. After few months again opened the phone as the warranty was about to expire it worked but this time software issue. Called customer service took it to store again. They said you have to transfer your data as we have to erase and set up new software. Returned home and transfer data . Went to store again today talked to the customer service. After listening my concerns he went and talked to the senior guy, who said may be they have to replace it. But again few minutes later they said we are recommending a replacement but we need to send it to apple depot to repair. So wait for approximately 2 weeks to hear from us. I had three trips (70 *3 km) and will have again after they call me plus additionally hour just going for this lemon product. Look like they give a Damn. Even the cheaper phone has better customer support than this. Have Mac and other I phone product but now seriously considering moving to others.

They couldn‚Äôt believe That no one had informed me. Then, finally I spoke to a manager by the name of Julie whom stated that it was cancelled because I used a debit card. Really!! Never heard of that before. It‚Äôs my same bank card that I use for everything that I explained to her. She told me to contact my bank. No compensation for my time lost with them. I then called back and spoke with someone else who told me again that there was no excuse or reason for what had happened.  He promised to send me some ear pods that I never received and told me to use a different card and try it again.  I then used my Amex card. Needless to say, my order was cancelled again without my knowledge and as of now my money is still pending on both cards. My bank is saying that Apple has to disregard the charges and Apple is saying that they have already done that. If so, why is it still pending on both cards!

I don't even find it pleasant to shop in your stores anymore, especially your flagship Birmingham High Street. The staff are only happy, if they are selling you something. Yet, most of the visits now are to fix something wrong with one of your products. You used to be great at service and even that (in my opinion) is mediocre at best now. Software bugs, security issues, a homepod that doesn't ship, yellow-gate, apple music is sh*te and deletes music, face ID fails, iOS 11 keyboard letter i doesn't work, antenna-gate, shockingly bad apple maps, battery-gate (that should have been a free replacement, not ¬£25! it was your pissing fault), slowing down my phone, bend-gate and an update every 20 seconds for a ¬£1100 phone.

THIS IS A FAIR WARNING TO THOSE WHO WOULD WANT TO PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM APPLE STORE ‚Äì DUBAI MALL USING YOUR EMIRATES NBD CARDS. THEY CHARGED MY DEBIT CARD TWICE FOR A SINGLE PURCHASE, ON SEPARATE OCCASIONS, 2 DAYS APART AND THE UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTION WAS ALLOWED TO PROCEED WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE, WITHOUT MY PRESENCE, WITHOUT THE CARD, WITHOUT ME ENTERING THE PIN CODE AND WITHOUT ANY SMS NOTIFICATION AFTER THE QUESTIONABLE TRANSACTION.   07 February 2019 Three colleagues joined me; I went to Apple Store in Dubai Mall to get a new phone. It did not take me too long to decide as to which specific model to choose because I have already made up my mind long before coming to the store.  Within a good 5 minutes after I walked in, a staff was already taking care of my purchase, took my details, the works. She immediately came back with the new phone unit on one hand and a card machine on the other (I decided to pay using my debit card). I have not really decided on getting the Apple Care warranty service but since the salesperson was kind enough to suggest it, I thought to myself ‚Äúwhy not?‚Äù and so I took it. I am aware that I can get that warranty until before the 60th day of my purchase but I trust the store (and the brand, sure). Looking back, I could have just paid them in cash instead of giving them access to my debit card. However, who would know that something bad is going to happen. I paid AED 6,129 for the device, an iPhone XS Max 512 GB Space Gray and AED 799 for the Apple Care. That is a total of AED 6,928 purchase done on the 7th of February. I was quite excited with my purchase, and everything was okay until after 2 days.   09 February 2019 I live nearby an Emirates NBD branch (Mankhool area) and in the late evening, I went to make a balance inquiry through the ATM. After which I noticed a difference with my account balance.  This prompted me to get bank statement the following day.   As per the bank statement, I was charged the amount of the mobile phone and the warranty, TWICE. First on the actual date of my purchase, 07 February; and the second was on the 9th (two days after). The questionable thing about the second transaction is the fact that I was not physically in the store to give them my debit card, more so, I was not there to enter my bankcard‚Äôs pin, and worse, I did not receive any form of notification (SMS) but my bank allowed the transaction. Have I not made a balance inquiry on the evening of February 09, I wouldn‚Äôt have noticed the change in my account balance and it wouldn‚Äôt have prompted me to get a bank statement.   11 February ALL 5 OFFICES IN A MATTER OF 8 HOURS, NOT TO MENTION I HAVE GRAVEYARD SHIFT LATER IN THE EVENING. Tell me if there is anything more frustrating than this!   I went to Emirates NBD Mankhool branch, and I was asked to fill out a dispute form. According to them, the problem started with the store‚Äôs (Apple Store Dubai Mall) machine as the transaction was initiated there itself. However, as to the question of how the transaction went through without me giving my bankcard, no PIN entry and no SMS, THIS THEY CAN‚ÄôT ANSWER.   I visited the Apple Store and informed them of my case and as from their statement, the bank was at fault.   (Great! These two, very unreliable establishments, pointing fingers at each other do not help the situation and is all the more increasing my already growing frustration.)   I made an online complaint to the UAE Central Bank website with Emirates NBD.   I went to the Department of Economic Development (a government agency that focuses on consumer rights).  I filed a complaint against the Apple Store, for double charging. According to them, it will take around 2-5 days to get a feedback.   I went to the office of the Dubai Police (within the vicinity of the Dubai Mall) and it is where I found out that similar instances has already taken place involving the same store. As to my information, there have been five (5) similar cases, more or less, on that day.   I also went to the Dubai Mall Security Office and in there, they have accumulated 5 different complains against the Apple Store in a matter of 3 hours, all happening at the same day!   12-13 February There is nothing I could do except wait and apparently, there‚Äôs nothing anyone can do about the situation.  This has cost me too much hassle, and by far the MOST INCOVENINENT thing that ever happened to me.  All I ever wanted was to upgrade my device, and all I get is physical (because I work night shifts and I can‚Äôt just go home and sleep because I had to go through all this mess), emotional, financial (I don‚Äôt keep an account just so anyone can easily take what they want, when they want!)   I am not in any way implicating any or both of the establishments involved, Emirates NBD and Apple Store at the Dubai Mall, but anyone can be a potential victim of this particular incident.  I have many questions in mind. What if this thing happened to a Dubai tourist, it is his last day in Dubai, and he does not have the time to go through all this mess? What if the person‚Äôs money is meant for something else, say for example, he is set to get his annual leave and about to go to his home country for a vacation, wouldn‚Äôt he need money to spend? What if there weren‚Äôt anyone giving him advice as to what to do?",AE

I went in to see about getting my defected charging iPhone cable replaced (the plastic coating at one end was peeling off which is sadly quite common not only for iPhones but MacBooks as well). I spoke to one of the store managers (Liz).  I explained to her how I've been a loyal customer over the years and that I had over 15 different iPhones to date (yes sadly over the years and over the different generations of iPhones).  I told her that I really believe this cable is defective.  I even pointed out to her how good quality looks like by pointing to the headsets on her associate.   Liz pretty much told me that there is nothing she can do for me because it's considered ""wear and tear"" even though this is from an iPhone XS Max that I recently got. She offered no other options and pretty much shut me down.  I asked her to pull up the limited warranty statement on the Apple site that speaks to this.  She asked another store associate read out to me something that doesn't speak to this all.  She couldn‚Äôt find or point to any supporting statement and just tried to brush me off.  Then she proceed to recommend me to buy another cable from another brand (yes she did) saying that if I didn't like the quality of Apple cable. Doesn't it sound ridiculous?!! Saying the Apple product is quality on one hand and refuse to stand behind the brand and then recommend me to use a better quality product from another company!!  I explained to her that Apple is a multi billion dollar brand and I am trying to help provide feedback to corporate so they can improve their quality. I pointed to her black headsets (they all wear that in the store) saying that type of material is good even with ""wear and tear"" and that Apple consider using it. She responded ""don't touch me"".  I was just simply pointing to her headsets. Another example of her not being empowered, sympathetic or listening to the customers.  All her focus was on fighting with me and not taking my feedback or concerns. Then I asked for her name, she wouldn't give me her full name. I asked for a business card. She pretended to go grab one but never came back. Another manger named Kevin approached me (must have been sent by Liz) and started talking over me and saying a bunch of stuff like he was reading it from a book and then proceeded to tell me that he would kick me out the store and get security if I didn't stop recording what he was saying (I told him that I was broadcasting our conversation).  He then kept talking loudly over me and kept calling me being disrespectful yet he kept threatening to kick me out and didn't give me a chance to talk.  So two Apple ""managers"" argued over an bad quality cable with a very loyal customer making a scene. Every other customers was listening and hearing this.  Not good Apple. Not good Apple.  Really need to learn to listen to your customers, re-evaluate your cable quality (this is not a unique issue), train and empower your associates, and stop making bad quality yet expensive products that you cannot stand behind! Still cannot believe that Apple argues with a loyal and good client over a stupid cable. The worse thing is both Mike and Liz were being racist to me since I observed after they were rude to me that they were nice to clients that are white and tall and didn't interrupt or talk down on them. I can back this up with facts!  Apple needs to take action ASAP or it will loose all good clients and market shares!",US

I took it to The Galleria Apple store in Ft Lauderdale. They said they cannot fix and will need to send it off for repairs. The repairs will cost $575.00 and then they still cannot guarantee it. Apple SUCKS as they do not stand by their product. A $1300.00 Mac I would assume should last longer then 3 yrs. Totally upset with Apple and I am sure they have their money and do t really care!!!

While many consumers are likely to complain about the screen/phone durability, I have only cracked 1 of the 4 iPhones I have owned in the last 8 years. That being said, there was no case or screen protector on and it was towards the end of my contract. Although I am not contracted (through phone service company) by how many times I drop my phone, I am contracted by every 2 years and how ever many drops that time frame entails. I appreciate the sleek design of each device, as well as size variation. Other features I like are group FaceTime, flash on front and back cameras, and the health app.",US

I assumed it would be very straightforward, but it was far from. The technician at the Genuis Bar ran a test and told me that he wouldn't replace the battery as there had been some water damage. I expressed my surprise as I am very careful with my phone and had never allowed any liquid to enter the phone, but the man refused to change his mind.  However he was very happy to sell me a new replacement phone (iPhone SE 64GB) for ten times the cost of replacement battery.  Ker-ching for Apple. Disappointment for me. Whatever way you view this, Apple is trying to wriggle out of its promise. It's not in its warranty, just a statement on its website.  Apparently that battery replacement programme was hitting the bottom line to much. Why not sell customers a new phone instead? Check out those bottom line figures now! Job done.

4073,www.apple.com,2019-02-01T20:02:03.000Z,1,Very Disappointing,"Very Disappointing. I had an issue with my 4 year old MacBook Air which would not complete booting up. After spending over two hours with the online chat support, who tried their best to sort the problem out but couldn't, they suggested that I take my laptop to the ""genius bar"" in the Aberdeen branch of Apple. Surprise, surprise the genius couldn't fix the laptop either and diagnosed a faulty hard drive. He did however give me two options. I could either stump up ¬£360 to have a new hard drive fitted or pay over ¬£950 for a new one. Now, I appreciate that this laptop is out of warranty but surely, given that this is a premium product with a premium price, it should last more than four years. I asked if there would be any goodwill gesture towards the repair. No I was told ""that's not our policy"". Would there be any kind of goodwill gesture if I bought a new laptop. No I was told 'that's not our policy"". Would there be any kind of trade in value for my existing laptop against a new one I asked. No I was told ""because it's not working"". I pointed out that we have at least eight Apple products in our household but the fact that we are loyal customers and have spent thousands of pounds over the years on their products makes no difference because ""everyone is treated the same"". If this is Apple's idea of good customer service then it is no wonder that their sales have started to fall. People will only pay a premium price if they feel they are getting good value and as far as I'm concerned on this occasion they are way short of the mark.",GB

I have had this phone for two years now and recently the phone began to have major issues. I am unable to make or receive phone calls as the sound does not work...being unable to make phone calls can be extremely dangerous and phone calls should be the ONE THING a phone can do. The headphone jack is also not working so I have to use bluetooth headphones. Also, the camera refuses to actually capture photos half the time (on the camera app as well as on apps like snapchat, instagram, etc.). SO, the phone cannot do its basic duty (making phone calls) and the main feature I was excited about (camera) is buggy and only works half the time. I have only owned this phone for two years, it should not already have a myriad of issues like this.  Since the phone had been having issues I decided to schedule a Genius bar appointment and drive two hours to the nearest Apple store. Before even beginning to run diagnostics on my phone the employee explained that the sound issue sounds like a known issue happening with iPhone 7's with the sound card. He then ran diagnostics and found that this was the issue. He explained that these issue were not my fault and I had done nothing wrong but that the new ios they had pushed through had ""brought forth issues"" in many iPhone 7's basically rendering them unfixable and useless. I asked him about the other issues my phone was having (camera issue mainly) and he said that at this point those issues are a moot point since the phone is unable to function as a phone due to the sound card issues. He then proceeds to tell me that since I was no longer under warranty he would not be able to replace my phone unless I paid them $340! So basically, Apple pushed through an ios update that broke my phone and then expected me to pay them money to fix their mistake.  I tried to reach out to Apple to just find out WHY they would not offer to fix their mistake without requiring a huge payment and the representative didn't respond to my chat she just disconnected. I have also submitted a feedback review to them about this and fully don't expect a response. I am disappointed in Apple and what they have become. Apple no longer represents innovation and quality. They're products climb in price but drop in reliability.  I loved Apple. After this experience I wont buy Apple products ever again.",US
4075,www.apple.com,2019-02-01T02:13:52.000Z,1,I bought my apple mac book pro in 2018‚Ä¶,"I bought my apple mac book pro in 2018 July, spent about close to $3000 CAD with the expectation that these machines are reliable and it would be rear that they will give me any issues, apple as a brand so much trusted my friends and family that i blindly bought this for my work. Here is what annoyed me and make me write this review and if some one is listening or reading this review, better do something about it to change my views about apple. One night i was about to sleep and my mac book was low on battery and died on me, I thought I will charge it in the morning, So when next day I plug it to charge the battery and check my emails,it never switched on, I called apple support they told me that my OS system is some how gone and they helped me to reload the operating system, I got very worried from that  day onward as battery dying is normal when you are binge watching Netflix, to add more to my worries, when ever i switched my mac book on, I see a grey screen  for few seconds, which i clicked pictures for my record to show to the technician at apple store, another occasion was when the screen started top flicker in middle of something important i was doing and than a strange sound started to come on its own from the mac book and i recorded it all and tech heard it. So now when i go to apple store to get my issues resolved, first of all i had to wait for 5 hours before i can see the technician and than when i finally see one they spent 5 mins and told me that the diagnostic that they did every thing appears OK but i should leave my system, with them to dig deeper. I asked what if they do not  find anything wrong, than she said i just have to keep working on the laptop until something really happens, So my concerns is the problems my mac book is having is recorded and the technician saw them and had no answer what and why they were happening, what if once the manufacturing warranty is over would they give me a new laptop or  fix it.This is not fair that to charge hundreds and thousands of dollars for your products but when it comes to customer service and customer satisfaction you are so poor that you have no concern or empathy for the customer who spent all that money and now have to live with this doubt that there is something wrong whit the laptop that apple cant explain. I am one unhappy client that apple has lost today, I  was thinking to upgrade all my office systems to apple but not any more, first you pay $$$$ for apple products and than wait in line for hours to see the technician and than at the end they do not  take any responsibility of there products. So apple no more place for you in my world and that what i will market to all my family and friends and on my face book.If any one is bothered than do something about it.",CA

People stand in line for days to discard hundreds of dollars, so they became careless, selfish and mediocre. Our first Apple products were great. As the years went by, it appears we all were easily sucked in for one of the most expensive product lines of crap. Our last few experiences with Apple products and customer service were so bad that I have decided to stop buying Apple products. Stop dying to give them money before their stuff is even available!  Let it get dust on the shelf and maybe they‚Äôll eventually produce a dependable product! Everything started with my phone having issues with my voicemail. As I use my cell for business in a daily basis, I would receive calls, and many times voicemails. Every time I would want to listen to my voicemail the phone will freeze, and I would have to restart it with the power button. I‚Äôve been dealing with endless calls and customer service iddeaots and unreliable AppleStore Appointments, for about a year, until I had to switch to 8Plus. The issue was with 7Plus...that 7Plus was replaced few times, couple times because of the voicemail issue and once because the screen failed. Everytime I had to pay a fee. Whyyy? Why paying fees when the damn phone screen fails after a few days the phone has been replaced??? Then I made a purchase online for Cyber Monday, suposebly there was a $100 discount stated clearly on the website, to find out after I made the purchase that the $100 was, in fact, an extra purchase for $100 Apple Gift Card. What a load crap!!! After pouring thousands every year in Apple products, to waste a couple other days of my life to clarify and fight for the $100 discount it‚Äôs just above and beyound. I hope that $100 will freacking make them a lot richer.  And now, my wife‚Äôs watch touchscreen just came off, out of the blue the $900 freacking watch failed after just a year. My wife is on her way to the Apple store to get a watch replacement. Obviously, I expect like $150 or $200 fee....why, why pay a damn fee when ur products keep failing?!!! I am done!!! I will switch and turn away from Apple and I will make sure all my friends and family will hear my story and I shall do my best to convince them to turn away from these crooks!!!!

I am just going to post this in every venue I can find on the internet.  Since I have wasted five days of my life trying to deal with this issue (two of them while on holidays in a sunny warm destination), I figure wasting a few more hours will just make me feel better.   Apple finds a way to vehemently deny that a software update caused my issues of not being able to hear and use my phone.  The phone is greyed out and the Imessage is intermittent as well.  Face Time?  A thing of the past.  I was on a cruise ship and did an update.  When I got off the ship I tried to call someone.  The call went through fine but I couldn't hear them and they couldn't hear me.  Now I am on holidays dealing with Apple Support.  I went to two other independents and they told me I had to go directly to Apple.  Today is Wednesday and I have been dealing with Apple Genius Bar and Apple Support since last Friday.  The only thing I know is that my phone was working perfectly fine before I did the update.  I read people online having the same issue.  Apple told me that it is only about 1% of apple users that have this problem and there is no fix and no solution other than buying another phone.  So, I have wiped and restored my phone three times now with three different Apple support people.  I was told to escalate my file to Tier 2 when calling in.  I did  just that.  Now I have wasted another six hours of my life today dealing with a Tier 2 manager and just hearing the same thing.  It is a hardware issue and not a software issue.  Ironically at the exact time I was waiting for my phone to reboot, my girl friend tells me she is having the exact same problem with her son‚Äôs phone.  Hmmmmm.  Two of us?  Best friends to boot.  But its sheer coincidence that this is happening to us.  According to Apple.    A hardware problem not a software problem and therefore we are on our own pay to fix.  After drinking the Blackberry koolaid it took me a very very long time before I switched to Apple.  Now I have been an Apple supporter for many years now.  I switched as everyone used to tell me that their customer service is second to none.  They sooner just give you a new phone then face bad publicity.  I guess the big Apple giant wiped out a competitor with Blackberry and now they have a controlled monopoly of the market and therefore their customer service can go down the way side like so many other large companies.  I‚Äôm just letting people know that if they are having the issues too  their pain and frustration is valid and you are not losing your mind.  Regardless what anyone tells you, you know that your phone was working fine before you did the update.  I just want people to read this and find comfort and solace that they are not alone.  At the end of the day I have to buy another phone.  I have no option.  What I chose to buy is still the big question.  I am sure that everyone out there, regardless of the device they have, someone has had a bad experience with it.  Android?  Blackberry?  Apple?  Plus One?  At the end of the day, they will always have issues.  I think I feel better for voicing my opinion.  LOL!  Good luck to all of you that share my experience.",CA

When I called customer service, they tried to charge me $107 (nearly half the price) because they said the warranty was up even though it has not been a year. Because they were fixed, I had only a 90 warranty from when they were supposedly fixed.

People stand in line for days to hand over hundreds of dollars, so why worry about having quality stuff backed by good customer service?       My first apple products were fairly recently. I didn‚Äôt stand in any line but was a sheep following others into the deception apple had created. I suspect the ‚Äúi‚Äù stands for ideeott/s as we all were easily sucked in for one of the most expensive product lines of crap. Stop dying to give them money before their stuff is even available. Let it get dust on the shelf and maybe they‚Äôll eventually produce a dependable product. You don‚Äôt have to be the first to have a pos. It‚Äôs faster, cheaper and is what it is to take a baggie and follow a dog around. You‚Äôll also look less like the ideeott standing in line waiting to throw money into the toilet.      So instead of buying products because someone else has them or all the hype must mean it‚Äôs good needs to be replaced with reading reviews and finding companies who truly want your business and respect you as a customer. My research and my experience leads me to understand there is no way apple has any respect for us. I bet they never did, especially watching movies about apple.  That‚Äôs when it dawned on me what the ‚Äúi‚Äù probably really stood for.      I‚Äôve been trying to work with them for days, like all the others in these comments and there is absolutely no customer service. I have now given up and am researching new companies to replace what will soon be known in our household as ‚Äúapple frisbees‚Äù. They‚Äôre not good for anything else. I found some awesome items out there that seem much better and priced more reasonably than the apple pos line of products.      No wonder the only review sites I‚Äôve seen that offer some praise for apple are sites where employees give their opinions on companies they work for. If I got paid big bucks, benefits and didn‚Äôt have to do any work at all I would give good reviews too. No one at apple seems to care at all, but there comes a time when you have to care because it will all come crashing down if you don‚Äôt.       Small ‚Äúa‚Äù was intentional. They don‚Äôt deserve my respect either. Wouldn‚Äôt take correct spelling, but the word is the only word to use.      One thing seems consistently true ... if there‚Äôs hype, it wasn‚Äôt good enough on its own.",US

He returns to finally test my phone. Then he tells me he is going to replace my phone. Then he excuses himself... I wait another 5 mins. He returns and then tells me he has to just replace my screen. Then he excuse himself again. 5 mins later he returns and tells me it 9 mins till closing and he didn‚Äôt have time to replace the screen. I am so unsatisfied with Vintage Fairs service.

4115,www.apple.com,2019-06-19T16:06:58.000Z,1,Problems with Apple 2017 21.5‚Äù iMac and  iPod Touch.,"I bought an Apple 2017 21.5‚Äù iMac on 20 May 2018 from a well known high street chain. During the first two weeks  I had several instances of ‚ÄúLoss of Connection‚Äù between the Magic mouse + keyboard and the Mac. Then about 1 month in, the performance became slow with delays of about 15 seconds to open up System Preferences, Pages docs, Google and search results etc.  Apple Support tried to help interactively but were unable to solve the issue. At the same time, the mouse pointer began to freeze regularly, usually accompanied by ‚ÄúLoss of Connection‚Äù icons for the mouse and keyboard and the window for the ‚ÄúBluetooth Setup Assistant‚Äù. With an unresponsive mouse pointer, I invariably had to shut the machine down using the power button.  Over the following weeks, Apple Support tried again to sort this without success and by mid July the frozen pointer with associated alerts was happening 4 or 5 times a day. I was eventually told by the retailer‚Äôs support team that a Bluetooth problem seemed likely as there had been some reports of poor soldering between the Bluetooth module and the motherboard on these models. However he did suggest that I try moving our cordless phone base unit out of the room as these had been rumoured to interfere. This did not help so the Mac was returned for repair on 20th July but when I got it back on the 22nd August it was damaged and I was offered a new one by the store. This second one worked well until again about a month later when the exact same problems recommenced. We started disabling the Bluetooth in some of our personal items, such as phones, iPod etc., to no effect. By 27th September we were once more confronted by frozen pointers and having to switch off on average 4 times a day so the second Mac was returned for yet another new one. By this time I was almost reluctant to use the thing and we had turned Bluetooth off in everything we could think of in our house. But sure enough, on 22nd October, the stuck pointers all kicked off again. I had up to this stage avoided upgrading to IOS Mojave as I‚Äôd heard that many users were facing system crashes and suspected it was the cause. However in desperation I upgraded in case the Bluetooth issue had perhaps been solved within Mojave.  Unfortunately it made no difference. I finally returned iMac number three on 14th November for a full refund. To be honest, I would have considered sticking with the iMac if I‚Äôd been able to use a wired mouse and keyboard. It would not have been ideal but I would have put up with it. However I learnt that Apple had apparently ‚Äúde-stocked‚Äù their corded ones everywhere so that was not going to be an option. ( As a side note, my son‚Äôs iMac is about 7 years old and when he recently attempted to install Mojave, it failed. Not because the processor is no good or there isn‚Äôt sufficient memory or the hard drive is too small. It‚Äôs simply that Apple deem his iMac to be too old i.e., they want customers like him to go out and buy new ones. He would understand if the specs were not up to it but that isn‚Äôt the case. Like me he has lost all enthusiasm for Apple products and is currently investigating a Windows replacement. ) Further Update: Having just purchased and set up a Sonos Beam soundbar, I thought I would download and install the Sonos Controller App on my 5th generation iPod Touch just as a back up in case our smart phones develop a fault. Surprise Surprise !!!!! It‚Äôs not possible to update past v9.3.5 on this iPod. It just doesn‚Äôt get any better with Apple does it ? What utter rubbish.",GB

I used all my savings that I collected over the years and bought the MacBook Bro 13inch with Retina display 6 months back. Ever since, the laptop has been giving me a lot of problems. The main problem was that the battery use to drain very fast, it was relatively slow, used to hang very often. Being the latest laptop and one of the most expensive laptops in the market, I expected a premium quality product. After calling Apple Care a several times to explain my problems, I finally gave my laptop to the Apple service center. They diagnosed the problems and turns out that my laptop has several problems. There‚Äôs a problem in the trackpad, keyboard and the battery. Hearing this, I asked Apple to replace my product, but they refused.

Ironic that they call themselves ""Genius""! Despite one female ""manager"" at the store assuring me that I would be contacted within the following week to make good with a gesture of goodwill, no such call or email came from her/them. Some weeks later, more hours of my time was wasted again there, when each member of staff yet again (as they always do) insisted that I go through the entire story of what had previously happened. And on this occasion the ""manager"" belittled and smeared me... and then confirmed a couple of hours later that his earlier dismissive and belittling statements (about me) had been false. But still no apology.  The staff consistently demonstrated such poor judgement and lack of consideration and sensitivity towards me and caused me so much stress, wasted time and energy - and yet they did not care.

Apparently, it was not really changed to the factory default because it still had my old apple id and password in it.  It needed both of those in order to work.  I remembered the ID but not the password (it was very old).  For the next 6 WEEKS Apple support was not able to help me get my password reset.  I had to provide proof that I owned the phone which I did (purchase receipt, T-Mobile contract for the phone, and VISA receipt of the purchase).  I was told it would be a month before my phone could be restored.  It's a long story, but after 6 weeks of talking with one Apple ""specialist"" after another, I still cannot use MY phone.

She never returned to inform me on the status of my phone. 20 minutes later another employee comes to check on me and I also inform her on the situation as well as tell her its been over 2 hours that I've waited now. She goes to the back and comes out to tell me that they are finishing up on it now and it will be no more than 10 minutes before it's finished. Another 10-15 minutes passes and yet another employee comes to me to see what I needed. I filled him in on the story and he also went to check on the phone. He came back and said the phone had been doing a software update and that is what has taken so long. (I'm not stupid and have used apple products long enough to know it does not take over an hour for a software update to run.) He also informs me that it will be no longer than 10 minutes before my phone is ready. 15 minutes later an employee is finally walking towards me with what I assumed was my phone. I was wrong. He informs me that my phone wouldn't calibrate after the screen replacement (another new story) and they would just have to replace me phone. Now at this point I have waited for almost three hours for a three minute fix. As I begin to set up the phone on my own it asks for a code for the two step verification process. The employee said it was sending the code to my MacBook and I would need to take the new phone home, not functioning, and set it up on my own and contact them via phone with any issues. Unsurprisingly, when I get home and try to set the phone up it is NOT sending the code to my laptop but rather to a phone number I no longer have access to. At this point it's nearing midnight so I give up to try again in the morning. Now I have contacted an advisor via a phone call where she informs me that I will have to go through the reset process and it will take 24 hours or longer to get everything reset so that I can attempt to set the phone up again. However, I didn't believe that this was the only possible solution. After screwing with options on my Mac I finally figured out on my own how to set up the new phone through my Mac. By going into the settings and adding a verified phone number that I could send the verification code to. This has easily been the worst experience i've had with Apple. All I needed was a screen replaced and what I got was a not so genius ""Genius Bar"".",US

If you change an Apple product and set up a totally new Apple  ID you will find that the new password  will over-ride earlier passwords you set up on other products with different Apple ID's. Wasted nearly an hour with one woman who had NO idea or concern what I was talking about at all as I could NOT sign in to my apple original Apple ID from 2+ years ago with my CORRECT PASSWORD which worked 3 weeks ago!! I keep my different Apple products separate from each other so they do not conflict as they are used for different purposes. I tried to set up a new piece of equipment today and the password I have used for years did not work AT ALL wasting hours thinking the device was faulty. I got onto Apple to report that my password was NOT working with my products at all, one does know their own passwords even if they have them written down, (in coded format of course). I had not changed my passwords at all, so Apple had definitely changed them. One member of staff said change or renew the password. Why?, when I had perfectly reliable ones up until today, or so I thought. As this sort of thing is in my line of work I thought of the dealings I had had with Apple recently. I decided to purchase another piece of equipment and created a totally different Apple ID and of course a totally different password for use with the new ID. I remembered that this time the strength of the password was stronger than ones I had used/made on my other Apple ID's. After spending over 3 or 4 hours trying to get the equipment set up and speaking to two members of staff, at this moment in time, who had no idea how to listen to people and correctly interact according to the problem. One individual said that Apple would send me an email if they were going to change my password, rubbish they are NOT EVER allowed to change anyone's password at all, BS we called it in the military. I started all this around14.30 this afternoon, it is now 18.40 This is a direct caused why and how businesses are prevented from doing their own work, business disruption. I am still on the phone after being called back with no one on the line at all. Told this was to be a Senior Person from Apple Care to deal with the matter. 3 minutes and still no one there??? At last someone on the phone so perhaps I will get somewhere with case 100690169. A Senior Apple Care called M. 18.55 what a time waster. He was the same as the others, poo pooing what one says. Arguing, when someone states their email was changed pass to a department that can deal with the matter and DO NOT try to intimidate or bully someone into accepting what you say when you do not know what you are talking about and do not listen to what is being said at all.

No explanation and no feedback loop. Apple will not even tell us who the customer is as the reporting is terrible and there is no transaction reporting. There is a 14 day cooling off period but there should be a deduction for services provided and no refunds should be given for digital content. They also charge 30% commission on sales transactions for customers that they did not generate. If they had generated the customer then this would be acceptable but this is usually not the case.

My boyfriend changed my password to my phone, thinking it would be funny, so unable to get into it I tried to restore the phone. Forgetting I had Find My iPhone on, I was locked out of my phone, until I could provide the password for my Apple ID that was used when I originally activated the phone. But, I had forgotten my password so I tried to reset it. Apple never gave me the option to reset my password through security questions, so it would send an email, like apple did in the past. So what is the point for setting up security questions? They had only given me the option to use my phone number, which was out of the question because again locked out of my phone and stuck on the activation screen.. so receiving calls or texts on that number wouldn't work..  So, I received the page where it states that , "" You will be able to reset your password in 9 days.."" , because apple has felt the need to say that this is, ""When it's time to reset your password.."" it has been already two days where apple had previously said that the number I used for recovery would be sent instructions the following day. Well here we are, the following day, and I get an email saying instructions will not be sent until December 6, 2018 at 6 o'clock in the morning to the other phone number I used... Now I am unable to use my phone at all and in case there is an emergency there is no option for me to dial 9-1-1. Waiting for 11 days to get a simple problem fixed is completely flabbergasting, when this was never an issue in the past. This is not the first time they have done this, it also happened when my boyfriend forgot his password to his apple ID for his tablet and it took 15 days to fix.

4222,www.apple.com,2018-11-22T18:09:19.000Z,1,Very disappointed with MacBook Air,"APPLE is considered to be one of the most trusted electronics brand with best quality worldwide. However, I would like share with you an ugly experience of using MacBook Air. This is regarding the MacBOOK  Air 13 inch: 1.8 GHz Dual-Core Intel CoreI5, 128GB,  purchased on 5th August 2018 at Chandigarh, India.  My device was functioning well till 19th of November 2018. I used my MacBook Air last on 19th November 2018, after use I fully charged the device and left with flap down. On very next day (20th November 2018) to my surprise when I opened up my device neither its power is getting switched ON nor the keyboard light, without any accidental/physical or liquid damage to device.  Finally on 21st Nov. 2018 I have submitted my MacBook Air to nearest service centre (f1 info solutions & services private limited) and on next day from service center I came to know that the Motherboard of my MacBook Air  is not functioning, need to be replaced. This is real surprise that if the worldwide best product (MacBook) is behaving like this within less than 5 months of purchase with moderate daily use. Looking at this why one should go for APPLE Products instead of others really good brands in market, I think they are providing better services than MacBook. This was the first time have trusted Apple for MacBook, probably I will not have trust in future again.   If Apple‚Äôs new product is not serving even 6 months without fault then why one should trust Apple. Definitely I will not suggest people around further for APPLE products. Really I was not expecting such a poor performing device. Even my last laptop (of brand Lenovo), I used for five years without any product related problems at all. Anyways thank you for such a bitter experience with MacBook. I won't recommend anyone further to buy MacBook air",IN

Started getting stuck, couldn't let me use my normal apps like youtube, Facetime and Safari, used to get hang, used to get disconnect my calls after giving a beep sound without any reason, automatically used to get turned off and start by itself. I reported this issue in August and since August Apple has asked me to empty my phone entirely, I used my phone without any app for 48 hours. They reinstated the software and worked for few days and it went dead for the whole night one day, didn't work until I took it to a store (OOBE NEWMARKET AUCKLAND). No issues were told to me but I was forced to used this phone faulty phone, I was promised if I face any issue again, they are gonna replace my phone. I faced the issue again, I was again forced to go into a store (CONNECT NZ AUCKLAND), they generated a service report again and said no issues found, I was again forced to use this phone and was told since now your phone is upgraded to the IOS12, I wont face any issue, after few days again this phone got stuck and I couldn't use it for 2 hours as it got stuck while I was using FACETIME, which is an inbuilt app of Apple. I shared all vidoes with apple but those got ignored. They just want in writing that the phone has a hardware issue and thats when they will change my phone but no one is ready to look at the videos. They are calling me and just harassing me, stressing me out, forcing me to use the phone when it is completely faulty. Now I am again asked to go into a store and get a service report that should say hardware issue then only they can replace my phone or else nothing can't be done. Is this Apple and their services? They are just harassing me and I have cried over the phone explaining to them the issue but no one is ready to listen. My case was ignored for the whole week, when I emailed them, then they remembered that oh sorry we are still here working on your case. I am sick of going back and forth but not getting any resolution. Its been 4 months now and these people are harassing me and not doing anything but wasting my time by calling me and asking me to do this and that this and that for hours and hours on the phone. To be honest Apple is far better in INDIA and APPLE IN NEW ZEALAND AND PHILLIPNESS IS THE WORST. I would never buy an apple phone again as I am being forced to use this faulty phone and nothing has happened in the last 4 months. I would never recommend Apple to anyone, I have been using Apple since last 4 years but now its a BIG NO TO APPLE BECAUSE THEY HARASS PEOPLE AND FORCE THEM TO USE THE PHONE THEY HAVE BOUGHT. I have paid $1800 dollars for this faulty phone which is the biggest mistake of my life. I know they are just fooling me again by asking me to go into a store and nothing's gonna happen, I bloody dont want this phone, I need a brand new phone thats what I paid for I did't paid $1800 for this faulty phone. APPLE IS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE, I WOULD RECOMMENED EVERYONE NOT TO BUY APPLE PRODUCTS AS THESE PEOPLE JUST CHEAT YOU. APPLE IS A SCAM Thanks, Prakriti Vashishst Case no : 100605360370",NZ

4237,www.apple.com,2018-11-13T01:36:25.000Z,1,I HATE APPLE,"I HATE APPLE. I have bought countless apple products. I've spent tens and tens of thousands of dollars on their programs, their music, their movies. Phones, Laptops, ipads. I moved to South Africa from the USA 8 years ago, and so eventually I switched Apple Stores to South Africa, but that store is a joke. So I tried to switch back. Can't. No explanation why. Then I tried to use a credit card which is not a South African card, and it says I MUST PROVIDE A CARD FROM SOUTH AFRICA. Look mother flippers, I don't have a working bank card from that country anymore. I don't live there anymore but I can't switch stores? Cause a robot said so? Ain't any people working there anymore. It's all AI people. And evil too.  So Now Apple won't let me download ANY of the programs that I have paid for like LOGIC PRO which is expensive, or update any of my programs, or download any of my music or movies which I have bought and paid for. WHAT THE F..?? I probably own them 1.29 for some song which didn't go onto the South African card before it expired in Sept, but when I try to use my good card which is valid with 100's of other companies in the world EXCEPT Apple monkeys, now they treat me like a deadbeat. No other way to see what is owed or pay some other way. I'll send you a f**king wire transfer if it means I can download my paid for programs and move on. I even bought a Apple Book Pro recently, because my whole online life is stamped by Apple, and the bloody L key doesn't work. The computer is a few months old. I had an Air book for 5 years and no issues ever. I dropped it many times and it was dented and never glitched once. 2000 dollars later and, and my L key is acting like a dead AI robot that's making decisions about where people should bank. Dead. Blank. That's the face of Apple now. A program with no options. if I'm based in a racist rundown country, why do I have to bank there? Why can't I have a bank in Europe say? Why won't Apple accept that? The airlines do. Google does. Amazon does.  It makes me think that the whole goal of Mega companies like Apple is to keep people trapped in their respective countries like little slaves tied to a lord like in the Middle Ages. Why else do they frantically keep asking for my phone number in every way possible? So their customers literally can't leave their little intellectual property zones called countries. Hey APPLE, watch what happens when the spell is broken and people like me, who has spent their whole life buying your products, walk away. I programed an Apple computer in the second grade After losing 100's of songs in the f**king cloud, I'm done. I could write a book about the pain I've suffered from the bull you are spinning with your proprietary wars. Screw that. Your stock is already crashing. Good. So are your products.

They have admitted to programming updates to decrease battery life, and all updates are intended to increase glitches, problems, and stress for apple users for the simple reason of forcing the public to overspend to maximise apples profits. Using reckless deception to obtain a financial advantage or cause others a financial disadvantage constitutes fraud in most countries. Apple needs to be shut down, and it‚Äôs directors arrested until it can actually function with a primary intention to build products that actually work and last, and cease its contribution to the environmental damage this is causing and all the waste their products are creating. They should also stop building their products from cancer causing materials, and be accountable for all the cancers that developed in Chinese employees building their computers. They should also compensate people for all information and time lost due to either their intentionally made glitches or refusal to provide updates for older devices.

I was very impressed by the Apple Watch Series 4 advertised capabilities and decided to make the move. In particular I was interested in monitoring my heart rate at rest and during workouts. The watch does an impeccable job measuring the heart rate and the precision is comparable with that of highly specialized medical devices. Like many new IT products however, the Apple Watch Series 4 has quite a number of software bugs. One such bug (defect) is that notifications are not displayed on the watch if the heart rate is outside of the user configured Min, Max limits.  My attempts to work with Apple support were not successful. I spent more then a month working with a number of product specialists. Each and every one of them gave me a different excuse, but nothing was done to fix the issues I reported. I escalated to Apple Customer Service (by phone), which would call back to discuss but never responded in writing to the cases I opened.

After 6 failed iPhones in a year and a half, inability of the company to recognize product issue instead of user error (phone screen set incorrectly in the frame so the screen broke 4 times in 3 months, general inability to connect to the network and their fix option was for me to pay for it, etc.), I have sworn off iPhones. I will deal with the music compatibility issues; it frustrates me that Apple makes damn sure you have a tough time listening to their music on other devices and previously I didn't want to deal with it but now I will have to. I wasn't sure about my MacBook--it's treated me very well for a long time--but now I'm sure I'll be off Apple computers too. The ease of use is an obvious perk, but my computer has started installing updates without my say-so and, more importantly, when I have explicitly told it not to. This past update (unprompted) failed and sent my computer into a loop of failed downloads and restarts and failed downloads. Other reviews I found of the same issue say similar things: unprompted, unwelcome, and with clear issues. I was able to bypass the download by rebooting a saved copy of an old operating system, but the reviews tell me I should expect to reencounter the issue. Not ok. Big no-no, Apple. My computer, my privacy, my decision. I will learn code just to avoid Apple's bullsh*t; it's not worth the price and it's not worth the hassle and a half. Buy a cheaper computer that will do the same thing. Windows will run you around the block too but they'll only charge you half as much for the pleasure.",US

After only 5 months my laptop pro ($2500) died. To my shock, the logic board has to be replaced. Actually the problem was the hard drive which is now located within the logic board (along with the WiFi, keyboard, display, etc), they can't be replaced without replacing the logic board. Ok, no problem (I think). I purchased the Apple Care Plus. I'm good......not so. First, because it is an 'internal' part, there is going to be a charge of $299 for the repair. What! Check the fine print folks! Next, the part is on back order. It could take up to 2 weeks to get the part! This is a business computer. 2 weeks pass and no part. On the 14th day Apple agrees to replace the computer but rep can't tell me when it will ship. She agrees to call me 4 days later (??) with confirmation. On Monday she calls but leaves no message. I contact her every hour and get no answer or return call. I reach out to another rep (5 hours later) and find out the order didn't go through. New rep resubmits the order and says she will contact me in a couple of days, but never did. I call again and find out that the second request was rejected, but they can't tell me why. Another rep resubmits the ticket just today. I pressed for a delivery commitment which they absolutely refused to give me but he finally admitted that it would take another 2-3 weeks until my laptop would ship! What?? I heard a different story from each rep and the bottom line is that all that matters is Apple's bottom line. They have strung me along for the past 21 days and only now admitted to the truth. They are underhanded and are solely focused on sales. I couldn't believe what I learned about the inner workings (disfunction) of Apple. Read the reviews before you purchase! There are thousands of laptops in stores all over the world but they can't manage to put one of them in my hand for another month?? Something is seriously wrong! Then there's the intentional things they are doing such as slowing down older iPhones, child labor practices in China, etc. I don't know who they've become but not a company I want to be identified with any longer. This is the tip of the iceberg. Apple's are great as long as you never have a repair issue! Update: The third ticket was also rejected and I was told they were all submitted incorrectly so I had to purchase another computer! This was done completely outside of the Apple company. The store (not an Apple store but a 3rd party dealer) agreed to sell me a new computer and allow me to return the computer with just a usage fee. $100 every 2 weeks. I did finally receive a new computer from Apple. The whole issue took 42 days and countless hours of my time, a huge cost in terms of productivity to my company. The rep who finally resolved the issue did his best, but they can only do what they are authorized to do. He was a senior advisor, but his hands were basically tied. This was an unfortunate situation and even though the computer was eventually replaced, the damage is done. A very important detail to keep in mind is that 'Applecare' and 'Apple' are 2 very separate companies, something that is not obvious when you sign up for AppleCare.",US

They say I've been very unlucky but unfortunately, that doesn't provide a solution...  The first phone was said to be a ""dud"" and completely died 2 months in. Second one got stuck with No Service and needed to be replaced. Third had the frame pop out from an enlarged battery only 6 days after getting it!! After many discussions, they yet to make an effort to listen and try to go above and beyond for the customer and only say they can replace my phone once again. I further learned that a year and half's worth of iphone7's were made with a missing or malfunctioned part. They still sell all of those faulty phones, neglecting the value of their customer's time, especially spending 2+ hours waiting each time you need to see a technician and knowing that half of those faulty phones need to be replaced.

I had problems with my laptop keyboard and my Wireless Beats, so I went to a Spanish Apple Store in Barcelona as I was on holiday - I think it was called ""La Maquinista"". I was very poorly treated by the Apple staff and I was told to wait for more than 4h (that's ridiculous). Thankfully another staff member took me quite quickly and cleaned my keyboard, also gave me some advice on how to proceed when I come back to London (as the keyboard problem was persistent). So I left this Apple Store with no improvement in my situation, and treated unfairly and in a very rude fashion by the staff (to one exception as mentioned above). When I came back to London my issue was resolved quite quickly at the Regent's Street store, I only had to wait for 1.30hrs before having access to the genius bar. The lady who helped me was quick, efficient. I was also received with a very decent treatment at the entrance of the store. My keyboard issue being solved, she told me that I should get back a new pair of Wireless Beats with my warranty, and should be delivered within the next 7 working days.   The product never arrived at my flat. The repair status on the Apple website said ""Shipment on 28th of September"", and on the 8th October I was suspicious something happened as I didn't receive anything. So I called Apple's customer service and learned that the shipping company never found my home (in London!)! Never had this problem as I have been delivered several times by Amazon and Argos, and I checked with the Apple representative that the address was correct and it was.  This raises two issues: 1. I have never been contacted previously detailing this problem and could have been waiting until my death to be shipped this product. 2. It only happened with Apple. Hopefully, the 2 persons on the phone have been helpful and contacted me on the following Friday afternoon. Finally got my product which I had to pick up at the Apple Store that same Friday. I would like to point out that this has been the worst customer experience I ever had, and hence that the standards of Apple customer services are clearly poor - and there is unfortunately not much I can do. I had a much better service with Amazon, Argos and other companies in London.  Sincerely,  Pierre",ES

Apple has lost their integrity and are not standing behind their products. My iMac was a xmas gift, and not even 5 months after purchase a black screen with a prohibitory symbol and blaring fans appeared that rendered my device unusable. Apple support would help me with a temporary bandaid, until the device just stopped working; that was when I was forced to bring it to the Genius Bar. They kept it and said it would take 3-5 days to repair. They replaced my hard drive, and then called to inform me it needs further repair. They found another part needs to be replaced and because the part is not in stock it will take up to 10 more days to get my iMac back. In summary, 8 days without my computer, that I need to work from home, and now I am forced to wait possibly 10 more days. Wait, it gets better- Corporate wants to pacify me with a credit of $300 to their accessory store because I am asking for an exchange. Let's see, my husband paid close to $2000 for my nonfunctioning iMac, and although the device is not a year old and despite the fact that I have apple care...they will not exchange my iMac for new functioning one, rather they will replace all the parts of my current computer with the hope of getting it to function properly.

Out of the 10 Apple products we have purchased over the past 6 years, three devices became non functional requiring replacement or repairs.  All three devices became corrupt and just stopped working (not due to damage) after the warranty period requiring expensive repairs.  Our oldest Apple laptop (one of the first models released) is still working with no issues other than being a dinosaur. Thirty percent of our Apple products failed over 6 years.   We have other ""Non Apple"" branded computers/gaming consoles/cameras/cell phones dated back to early 2000's which are still working when turned on with no problems (just outdated).  I've never had as many failure problems with other electronic brands until we started buying Apple products.  We thought we just we were having bad Apple luck.  Seems the newer Apple products are attractive in design with interesting/competitive features to draw customers in and compete with other brands, however not designed as durable as older products or some competitors.   My opinion is that Apple has changed the strategy of building quality and durable products in the past that were very reliable to a current eye catching attractive products with a lot of want to be cool features that looks upscale with a high $$$.$$ price tag but, lacking in quality and durability with glitches/problems from trying to push a new product out every year.    The final straw which made me decide to steer away from Apple was the fact that Apple has pulled some sneaky moves on products in the recent past to include poor quality glass on iPhone screens, battery issues that were well known about, as recently has removed the iPhone X from their website to the point I couldn't find a manual for my iPhone X that I just purchased in July 2018 or find support titles for my phone.   Hmmm....... Call me crazy but, what's up with that?  Why are we hiding support documents and info for the Anniversary iPhone X?   Probably should verify my Apple Care Plus is still activated and showing on my account too? It's obvious Apple's current strategy in the business is to attract as many new customers as possible and make a huge profit as quickly as possible with as many products as possible (rightfully so) however, not at the expense of quality, reliability, and honesty which in turn pushes the loyal customer towards other brands as you can see.     Selling the new iPhone XS for $999 in 2018 versus 2017 iPhone X model for $999 is awesome for customers who waited a year later to see what Apple has been working on and what they were going to reveal.   A year later for same price, you get basically the same iPhone X with some enhancements and the nearly a year old iPhone X gets completely removed from the website?  IF THAT DOESN'T SEND CUSTOMERS A MESSAGE, FOLKS NEED TO WAKE UP"".    Apple wonders what's going on with their sales?  Read what I just wrote, put yourself in the customers shoes, and ask yourself if you would want to buy an Apple iPhone or Apple product from this experience.   Folks are on to the Apple trends and will not buy Apple products until they see enough reviews online to prove it's worth the steep purchase now or wait another year.   Apple is turning into a business like a cable company.  All about getting the new customer but after the first year, hard to keep a customer loyal.   It does leave a bad taste in my mouth though with the way they just removed iPhone X like it never existed and still have older phones prior to iPhone X still listed on their website.  I think the iPhone X was and is my last Apple product purchase.   My wife feels the same way. Apple, not sure if you are listening or reading but, my recommendation would be to ""SLOW DOWN"", focus on quality solid products and don't worry about what new cool product needs to be ready for manufacturing in January 2019 after September 2018 release of current products (4 months later).  Why not operate like Honda and Toyota, don't forget about the loyal fans and customers who currently have last years products, let the product be used, get feedback, focus on fixes, then when it's time to release the next fancy product, it will be shocking to everyone.   It would be nice to see Apple to work out a plan and come out with a fix to some issues with the product you just released last year.  Fix the glitchy iPhone X Face ID for last years customers.  Don't leave them to sit and watch a better product for the same price come out with no hope for a fix to last years model, just delete it so we don't have to deal with it.  it's just wrong and makes a bold statement that you have no time for last years stuff, focus is currently on whats now in production.  Seems like you're missing a team of engineers to focus on ongoing known issues.  We wish Apple the best but, I think we are tired of these trends.  Apple is not what it was years ago and it shows.   The new releases every September are no longer interesting.  It leaves me with negative thoughts from past experiences and we just want to look the other way. Sorry so negative but, we speak from the heart and the truth. Sincerely,",US

I then contacted Apple who agreed to cover the cost of the repair (in their language they said they would 'authorise an exemption'). Two days later I was asked to collect the repaired machine and expected a refund, however, on arrival was told that Apple would only cover the cost if Stormfront REMOVED the part they had just fitted and REPLACED with another part from Apple. This would have meant a wasted journey and another 5 day delay. They advised me to take it up with Apple. I collected the iMac and have since taken it up with Apple. They at first admitted that they would bare the cost but then changed tack and said that as I had paid Stormfront it is up to them to make a refund.

Now I do understand having security measures, but as I told the representatives I spoke with at Apple today, once I was verified from Thumb Cellular, and through the apple email as the owner of the account, they should have sent a password reset right away. It sounds so stupid the reason for not sending it now. I ask everyone at Apple who reads this to look at their policy . Imagine if your mate collapsed in Cardiac Arrest, and I being a nurse said, "" well we really don't know if that is Joe, but we will start CPR on August 23 at 12:28pm. You scream no I need you to start it now!""  You yell ""no call 911 for an ambulance,"" and the dispatcher says, ""well really this is your fault, you should have left his name band from the hospital when he born, so that we would really know it was him.""  I learned two lessons do not buy an Apple Product, no information given on the important things that a person is to remember. The second lesson I learned is don't put passwords in your phone. The next thing is I doubt that anyone from Apple reads this and that they really don't care, because they are Apple and for TODAY they think that their company could never fail. Just a hint General Motors thought they were to big to fail too!",US

I was astonished when the store assistant told me that Apple did not guarantee them. Furthermore he added if I should drop the phone and the screen cracked or it were to sustain any damage a replacement screen was over ¬£200.

We bought an iMac from Apple online 7/16 Order W589405707 Serial C02X304MJ1G9 Case ID 100600995249 Didn't come on day of deliver/y 7/23. Why? Apple wrote the wrong address. We had to contact the shipping company and fix the problem and received 7/24- Apple did nothing expect apologize for the inconvenience. Following Tuesday 7/31 my wife goes to turn on the computer and it gives her a huge electrical jolt leaving her left arm numb for about 5 hours. We call customer service and say the computer is bad and that we want a replacement, customer service lies and says that isn't possible, so we say ""Fine pickup the computer and give us a refund"" CS again lies and says that isn't possible. That the computer can only be serviced. I check online to see if others have had the same problem and find refunds & repairs from Apple's own web site saying we can return our computer with 14 days of receiving (which it is/was). So we call CS again to find out why they lied - of course they wouldn't answer, just CS doesn't do refunds, just service. But we get the repair service cancelled and then are giving the Apple online store number and setup to return the computer. What happens, On 8/5 Apple calls and admits it screwed up again and sent the iMac into repairs.  On 8/7 today, the iMac showed up in my garage. Apparently Apple isn't capable of sending a computer from their repairs division to their online store division.  We call CS to find out what's up. They say we have to call the online store again and set up another pickup because they can't do it. Is this really legally our responsibility? We sent the iMac to Apple using their print out address. Why do we have to deal with it again. Anyways, we call Online and now the new pickup is 8/9 and our refund won't be done until after 8/18 - after credit card is due, when we were initially told by 8/13 before credit card is due. So another headache in the making. I have to wonder is Apple really this incompetent or is it because my wife is Japanese and doesn't understand the legal system well?

After doing the usual 2 year financing and paying off the phone, the phone suddenly started giving me major problems: The center button (home button) stopped working.  As one can imagine, not being able to use my home button made me not able to navigate through my apps, select my apps, seeing my home screen, etc. etc.  (sigh).  I had to find ways to use the side button to light up my phone and swipe left to select whatever recent apps I had used or search.  Sometimes the search worked, sometimes not.   The phone battery drains down for no reason.  I could have it fully charged before bed, not use the phone while sleeping, and by morning, it would be down to 3% battery.  Sometimes the phone would be hot at random times.  Of course, since I can‚Äôt use the home button, I‚Äôm unable to close apps. Using apps will sometimes just not work.  I can be safari browser surfing and all of a sudden, touching the screen or navigating does nothing.  Or the response will be delayed. I‚Äôm just very disappointed in Apple.  I find it very ironic that in the 2 years of having this phone, I haven‚Äôt had problems but coincidentally after the 2 years, I now am having these issues.  Multiple issues, that make it nearly impossible for a person to be able to use their phone with ease. Of course there is no warranty to cover this.  Anyone is pretty much SOL.  What a waste of money. I am 110% certain that this is a predicted issue that Apple has placed for consumers - because the average person chooses to finance their cell phone for 2 years as most companies offer.  Therefore, it makes sense for a company like Apple to generate issues on their products right after 2 years, in hopes that consumers will just go replace their products to a newer product and finance a $1,000 phone again.  Since they‚Äôre financing, why bother looking at the total cost?  It‚Äôs a $1,000 for a CELL phone.  In this case, $500 per year.  The funny thing is that it‚Äôs the people who don‚Äôt really have the money (like kids/teenagers or low income people) that are the first to want to blow money on another $1,000 cell phone. I am no longer buying any Apple products.  I think they are a greedy company that‚Äôs running a conspiracy business and I don‚Äôt trust their products.

I have sent them evidence as it has become nightmare to put reviews. Here is my evidence  Since last new operating system installed by apple store nothing was installed , as wrote earlier having problem with emails & so forth. I started to avoid Apple upgrades but now thought will do & also installed virus protection.  After activating upgrade from apple store my computer shut down,  With computer shut down upgrading took place, then it did not switch back,  I have to restart  when pop  password came, after that security fire/vault poped up & gave 2 choices to iCloud  to remember password or  key numbers. I picked code. Pop up flashed key numbers which did not give me time to write but disappeared. Nothing else popped up to activate. I have written before I found my iCloud key numbers were listed  previously . Apple claims it does not remember iCloud  password so how come my numbers were listed in my MAC. This time numbers are flashed for others to copy but not for me to use. My files are now only can be saved in iCloud & download. Apple must explain how their own upgrade from the apple store has infected my computer once again &  not for my benefit. Another example: After much struggle I was going to publish Thames Water Trustpilot review. I kept pressing button to submit but window remain. I presumed unable to submit.  Then pop up came informing that it will take time to publish & will be notified by email. After I close the Trustpilot window to submit review, underneath there was Trustpilot window already published review with time.  It is clear from above example that window informing me it will publish later was from the hacker. My email work & then blocked, worked again along with other issues too  even pages.

It was literally burning hot and I couldn't touch it. I straight away removed it from the charger as I thought it will explode and i had seen how Samsung products and even some apple devices had exploded whilst they were charging and was scared as even my little one sometimes uses the ipad. I let it to cool down and tried to switch it back on but it did not do anything at all. Once it was totally cool down I plugged again to see if it was charging and the ipad did not give any response so I decided to contact the customer service where they asked me to reset and connect it to a computer but none showed any activity on the ipad, therefore they booked an appointment for myself at an apple store. I went to the appointment and the staff connected the iPad to one of their chargers and said it should switch back in 15 minutes. But the ipad did not switch on at all and the staff said, that they can swap an ipad for the price of ¬£165. I was like what?? There is a safety issue with this ipad and this could have been exploded if i didn't check and take it off the charger when it was burning hot, so why do i need to pay for a faulty or an ipad that develops safety concerns. I had been then told by the staff to wait till she speaks with her manager and she came back with another alternative to pay ¬£85 instead just for the battery and they will swap it. I do not think they really car for people and they safety as they all want is to recover or earn some money out of every issue. Really disappointed with the product and mostly the service I received. Would not recommend buying the apple products as I strongly believe safety issues like this should be handled and dealt with more responsibly as they are playing with people's lives.",GB

I checked in with one of their employees who told me to go sit in a specific area.  I sat there for an hour and when I checked with another employee I was told since I didn't show up I lost my slot.  Then I lost my temper.  One of the store managers noticed my disgust and came over and got me to a more private area.

During various email contact attempts Apple support has given me conflicting assurances and avoided answering my direct questions about their obvious and convenient assumptions and contradictions.  Because of this I have asked for the matter to be raised at a higher level (promised by support) only to be fobbed off by somenone (no surname) who claims to be a 'managerial representative' and seeks entirely to evade giving me any useful reply except the Apple equivalent of 'go away we do not pay'. I cannot view this in any other way but (1) as a deliberate deceit and (2) a refusal to face a duty of care towards clients and their purchases made in good faith and in the expectation of an honestly observed consumer rights process. In this case they seek to  (3) put the onus on me, for not having a receipt for a gift despite receiving from me the adequate explanation which they required. (4) put the onus on the vendor, who ""may not"" have activated the card, when they cannot disprove that (an assertion, e.g. ""may not  have"". is not proof) the card was faulty in the first place. (5) remove the onus from themselves by ignoring my questions about the reliability of the machines installed (by Apple ?) for processing the cards at purchase in the first place - again no satisfactory reply. I would like Apple to make a simple refund of the Gift Card face value of ¬£15 sterling which Support assured me could be done.

First off, every single time you make a new iPhone, it just gets 1000x worse. iPhone 6 was doing ok, but then 7 was complete trash. The removal of the audio jack was the dumbest idea I've ever heard. The developer who got that idea needs to be fired. No one cares that you added more speakers. No audio jack means headphones require some stupid connector, they will often pop out of the phone when connected because the charger slot was never as strong as the audio jack slot, and you can't charge and listen to music at the same time. Oh my, I can't wait for 10. No more button, that's gonna be the most annoying thing in the universe. What's next? The removal of the screen? And it's not just your awful physical products that are terrible. Your apps are just as bad. Maybe even worse. iMovie is complete garbage. It is way too limited. You can't do anything with the trailers, they will always look the same and unprofessional. Someone's gonna see it and go, ""Oh, they made it in iMovie, that's cheap.""  You can't include any music of your own either, which is really annoying and lame. Making movies is quite useless as well. There really is nothing you can do with a movie but change the stupid lighting. iMovie is a big waste of time. I could do an entire movie in power point and it would look better. Don't even get me started with Garage band. That app is even worse than iMovie. First off, no one likes that metronome. You need to toss that piece of crap into the trash. It's obnoxious and does nothing but get in the way. The instruments are also garbage. You can barely play anything at all, and they sound fake and way off. Plugging in a real instrument is also a waste of time. Because you just take away all my good effects from my amp or pedals and replace them with your trashy ones. Recording is the most annoying thing in the world. Apple makes this nearly impossible. There needs to be no time limit at all to when you record. And the loops needs to start AUTOMATICALLY when you're ready to record it. It's common sense really. Something your company doesn't have. Honestly Apple, get your act together. Your products and all of your other crap just make you look bad. I would not recommend your garbage to ANYONE.",US

TrustPilot is living testimony to what trying to deal with Apple is really like. Having made an instantly regrettable mistake which saw my Music Library vanish I discovered that there was no simple workaround for recovery, my bad. Naively I didn‚Äôt think that this would be an irreversible issue or one that occupy a whole morning of my life. The eventual answer, extreme at it was, was to reset my iPhone to factory settings and restore from iCloud. No warnings were given to me which, in hindsight would have saved me considerable frustration, stress and further disappointment with the way that Apple manage simple issues such as asking me if all my iCloud details were up to date. Perhaps a hygiene factor question but this simple question would have alerted me to what might lie ahead. Even though all my iCloud settings were correct my current Cell number was not registered to my account. I therefore found myself in an ever decreasing spiral of despair a) trying to explain this and b) despite using more more sensitive security information to prove my security (my Credit Card) I could not restore my iPhone because the security code was sent to a cell number I couldn‚Äôt access. I spoke to at least 3 people without being able to log into my iCloud Account, even getting into ScreenShare with an Apple associate. Ultimately I was told I‚Äôd have to wait 24 hours for reasons only known to Apple. Still not heard but there‚Äôs still time, so we‚Äôll see. Latest:  No call back as promised, I have now spoken to a Senior Advisor who felt confident he could help but the issue still remains unresolved.  Left message for Senior Advisor on his DL but hasn‚Äôt he hasn‚Äôt returned my call so the pit of despair remains. It is quite a horrendous experience. The need for security is paramount but Apple is beyond obsessive verging on paranoia especially as there are several layers of security and I could pass any of them in a heartbeat, except the cell phone number. I volunteered to give my cell number to them but they couldn‚Äôt do this, go figure. A great shame as Apple has much going for it but this is not the first time I‚Äôve found dealing with Apple a bureaucratic, onerous, unrewarding and massively frustrating experience.",GB

After only one year the phone‚Äôs battery began draining significantly. We sent the iPhone in to get the battery replacement from Apple on April 20, 2018.  We received an email from Apple on April 23, 2018 stating they received the product. On April 23, we received an additional email saying they would be unable to replace the battery because of ‚Äòunauthorized modifications‚Äô. They stated that the only options were to pay $450, recycle my phone or send the phone back unrepaired, or contact Apple support.  We called Apple support the same day to inquire what the modifications were. The first person we spoke to read the ‚Äòtechnicians note‚Äô stating they found ‚Äò3rd party modifications‚Äô. We asked what 3rd party modifications they claimed to have found but they were unable to tell us.  We ended up speaking to 4 different ‚Äòsenior advisors‚Äô. None of them were able to tell us what modifications were found, and they were unable to communicate with the ‚Äòtechnicians‚Äô and ‚Äòengineering department‚Äô at Apple in order to find out.  We spoke to Bryan, a senior advisor, on the 24th and he said to give him 2 days and he would get information as to why the technicians won‚Äôt replace the battery. He called back on April 26 and had NO information for us. This was 2 more days wasted. He said he was unable to contact the technicians.  He advised us to speak with one of the ‚Äòsenior advisors‚Äô that we had spoken to before. At this point we‚Äôre going in circles. When we demanded that they escalate the issue, he referred us to Cassandra, a ‚Äòsenior customer relations‚Äô representative. After again being on hold for a lengthy period of time, Cassandra said she was looking over the case notes. She said the carrier was AT&T. Which is false. It‚Äôs US Cellular, which she should have had in her notes, because we told the first Senior Advisor we talked to on April 23rd that our carrier was US Cellular.  Also in my conversation with Bryan, we had specifically stated the name of the carrier.  So clearly, there is a lack of communication between the departments. Cassandra then asked about the $450 to replace my phone. SO we AGAIN asked to speak with a manager or supervisor. She then connected us to Robert. Once again, in another futile conversation, and still left with the lingering question as to what were the 3rd party modifications. To resolve the issue, Robert wanted to send my phone to an Apple store.  He stated that at an Apple store, a person would actually be able to look at my phone. Which is extremely odd since that had already told us their SENIOR engineers had already examined the phone.  We thought the phone was in good hands when we shipped it to Apple. We are unclear as to why the Apple ‚Äútechnicians and Apple ‚Äúengineers‚Äù at their facility were not able to ‚Äúactually look‚Äù at my phone.  At that point we asked them to send the phone back since refused to replace the battery or bother giving a truthful explanation. We received my phone back on April 30, 2018.  After 10 days, they returned the phone. However, whatever they did completely destroyed it. The phone won‚Äôt turn on at all now and their suggestion is to buy ANOTHER $700-$1,000 phone off them.

Although their CEO insists that the ""company doesn't want to be a cash hoard"" do they have any empathy or concerns for their millions of customers?  My daughter is a college student who we believed a MacBook Air would be an invaluable asset for her education, despite the cost. It stopped working last week after only using it 3.5 years. If we knew that we would have this huge problem after investing what we did in the laptop, and the disregard for helping the customer that we have experienced, we would‚Äôve thought twice about choosing Apple. I am disgusted by their lack of customer service.  My daughter had experienced slowness with the MacBook a few weeks before, and we took it to our local Apple store here in Kansas. They diagnosed the issue, and said that everything was running smoothly. They had kept the laptop for two days at this point. This meant my daughter, in her final semester of college, was not able to work on papers or projects during this time. Now, only 2 weeks from her degree and a very costly! repair we have found no consistent information from Apple. They do not offer any sort of student aid programs, and flat-out refused for us to take the microchip hard drive from her laptop so we could try and retrieve her projects. There are companies that do this all the time, but Apple said that the microchip in the MacBook is forbidden to be removed from their stores or repair facilities. Parts that we OWN! These projects are ESSENTIAL  for graduation; not to mention the laptop also houses her resume, cover letter, and senior projects. I have never seen the amount of anxiety from my daughter that this issue has caused.   The techs we did speak to admitted that the hard drive should have lasted for many more years. Even after explaining the urgency of resolving this issue, the tech support person said that it would be a week before we could get an appointment.  The manager of the store was ‚Äútoo busy‚Äù to help us. We got the run around multiple times after HOURS of waiting on hold and speaking to many people. At one point, a tech even stated the issue would be an easy fix, and take five minutes to repair. Now, Apple is stating that the hard drive was defective and refuse to help us.  This is a time in my daughter‚Äôs life that she should be enjoying the fruits of her labor regarding her college education. Instead, she is devastated over something that should not be Apple‚Äôs policy in the first place. Again, what happened to customer service? Where would Apple be without their customers?

I recently upgraded from an Iphone 6s plus to an Iphone X.  I did so thru my cell phone carrier at the cell phone carriers location. I went there instead of Apple because of convenience from my home and so I wouldnt have to go to the mall which I hate.  I was not able to trade in my phone because of an activation lock from Apple.  It was locked with an email address that was not mine indicating someone may have gotten the serial number to my phone and used it for another phone. Not my fault at all. Breach of Apples security.  After spending multiple hours on the phone with Apple they said they would send me a receipt from my original Iphone 6s plus purchase which i bought at Rockaway Apple.  With that receipt I could go to Apple and show them proof of purchase and they would then finally be able to unlock the phone and take the phone for a $175 credit.  I received the receipt 2 days later and went to Apple Rockaway today.  After 30 min of back and forth they were finally able to unlock the phone and thry also confirmed someone probably ripped off the serial number and reused it. Again news to me and not my fault.  They then told me they would give me a $175 gift card for the trade in but first wanted to scan the serial number of my new Iphone X. They did and then proceeded to tell me that because I purchased my new Iphone at the cell phone carrier location instead of Apple that they couldnt take my Iphone 6s plus and that i‚Äôd have to go online with Apple to handle this. They said this was to encourage customers to buy directly from Apple.  By this point I was getting angry and asked to speak to a manager and unfortunately the manager was useless saying the same thing about encouraging customers to buy from Apple.  Who cares where I bought the Apple Iphone from? Why sell products thru other companies if that is your best answer? I have purchased thousands of dollars worth of Apple laptops, Desktops for my company, more Ipads than I care to say and too many accesories.  And you can‚Äôt take my trade in because I bought my new phone at one of the cell phone carrier locations they support?  Your answer is to encourage customers to buy thru Apple?  What your doing is inconveniencing the customer and encouraging the customer to not buy anything at all from Apple.  I would reconsider buying Apple products at this point for multiple reasons and I would definitely discourage customers from going to Rockaway Townsquare mall Apple if you have a problem.  They are not helpful. I dealt with 3 employees total over the course of an hour in the store and left the store angry and with nothing solved and my old Iphone 6s plus in my hand.Thanks",US

It swelled up so bad the phone cracked apart in the middle on the front and back of the phone, exposing the entire inside of the device. I was in Thailand when this happened, and anyone who has been there in April knows it is extremely humid and very hot. I had to truck around this phone that was now exposed to the elements for the next 2 weeks before I was able to get back to the United States and take it to Apple. The Apple store evaluated the device, checked for any other damage besides the battery and also checked the water damage indicator to make sure nothing else could have caused this to happen. There was no indication of water damage or physical damage to the phone so they sent it off to ""Apple Repair Center"" for them to look at it in more detail and told me the phone would be replaced....everything so far has been handled like it would be expected, until ""Apple Repair Center"" decides the phone must have had water damage before the battery swelled up because there was corrosion inside the device. THE DEVICE WAS CRACKED OPEN IN A VERY HUMID ENVIRONMENT FOR 2 WEEKS AND THE BATTERY EXPLODED AND LEAKED ALL INSIDE THE PHONE, OF COURSE THERE IS CORROSION!!! Their response to that was ""we have determined there must have been water damage prior to your trip to Thailand, because the corrosion couldn't have developed like this in only 2 weeks."" So they want to charge me $550 for the phone that they already charged me $700 for 3 months earlier...THAT IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE BS!! First of all, the Iphone X is supposed to be water proof/resistant so how did water get inside the phone if there was no sign or indication water had entered the phone before taking it apart to see corrosion?  Second of all, if there was corrosion in that phone before I went to Thailand, then it was in the phone when I received it brand new!

Back in January 2018, I called Apple support due to slow default apps on my phone.  I was told I need to get the battery upgraded after running test. I was also told the battery would not be in until late March 2018.  I received a call to inform me the battery was in the first week of March and I did a drop-off on March 8th in Oakbrook, IL with an excellent condition phone, fully working phone.  I paid $31.18.  I received it back without the transmitter working and 41% charged battery.  I reached out to Apple support and was given an appt. to go to the Lincoln Park store on March 16th to have it repaired. After much waiting and paid twice for parking, $12.00, I was returned a BROKEN PHONE by Austin. Around 1:01 p.m. during our dialogue of the solution, Austin said he was going to get me a NEW iPhone 7 plus for the inconveniences. (They did not properly follow protocol to confirm they had the part in prior to breaking my phone). I repeated back for a confirmation and he said yes we will be getting you a new iPhone 7 plus. Austin said I had to go to the Magnificent Mile store to pick it up, (which was a larger inconvenience for me to get there).  I requested to speak to a manager to learn why I am being further inconvenienced to get my phone and he got Daious, appearing apathetic, stating that I must go to Magnificent Mile to get an iPhone 6s plus to replace the phone they broke (iPhone 6 plus).  I told him what Austin told me that I will receive a (new iPhone 7 plus) and he told me that's not what I will be receiving.  I asked him to contact corporate and he told me no, I can call corporate if I like. (THEY BROKE MY PHONE which had NO display to make a call).  I told Daious you guys broke my phone to make it non-functional and now you send me out of here with no communications, these are not options I agree with and I like him to give me a new phone from his location and he said ""That's not going to happen and if I leave with the broken phone, he will no longer assist me"".  Daious also admitted his techs did not follow protocol before taking in the phone to repair and he will deal with that on the back end.  I told him to give me a printed work order of what they done and the useless phone they broke and I am leaving. (He took 20 minutes and I had to send another store manager to seek him).  I left out and came home and called Ava at corporate and emailed her about the problem and she contacted Lincoln Park and Magnificent mile store.  She said she is not sure she can get me an iPhone 7 Plus but she should be able to get the iPhone 6s plus and a wallet and privacy screen (to replace the one I had and just repurchased) $26.45.  Ava confirmed there will be an iPhone 6s plus waiting for me at Magnificent mile.  After getting assistance to get there and sending a family member in (due to no parking),they returned with a phone wrapped in plastic. I got back home late night to hurry and get my data restored and run the serial number only to learn I have a 6 Plus (NO UPGRADE). I emailed Ava to tell her of my frustrations and deceptions and she responded back I was supposed to receive an upgrade and she was sorry.  After going to Old Orchard location about people not hearing me talk, I brought up my reimbursement for my battery I paid for in the broken phone and they took all of 30 minutes to convince me it was new. He avoided putting it in writing until I insisted several times after they said they can't do anything more to help my situation at Lincoln Park store (Gus-Tech, and Rebecca -Team Lead).  After several communications and escalations with corporate, Michael was involved on 3/25/18 and I told him I wanted him to investigate this whole ordeal and return my call on 3/26/2018.  After his return call, he told me since there was no documentation about the upgrade and the store personnel said I misunderstood, there is nothing more he can do for my case and he was closing it. I have proof and an upgrade was supposed to be honored and I feel this was deliberate to get me to purchase a new iPhone.  I filed a complaint with BBB today and requested for them to contact Apple on my behalf to fight this cause.  I want other consumers to be aware.

The phone was freezing, screen randomly going dark, and the microphone  malfunctioning.  I contacted  Apple and spoke to a representative by the name of Bridget Ball.  Bridget assured me that Apple would replace my phone with a new IPhone X.  Welll, Bridget Ball never followed through, I waited over a week and she never took my calls nor responded to my voicemails.  Today I spoke to another representative by the name of Harold, who also assured me a brand new replacement then proceeded to transfer me to his supervisor Josh.  Josh denied Bridget Ball‚Äôs agreement about replacing my phone with a new phone.  I told Josh that I wanted a new phone as I had originally purchased.  He said he would only send me a refurbished phone because I had the phone for 15 days past the purchase date.  I asked to speak to his supervisor hoping to get what I was originally promised as Josh was attempting to intimidate me by firmly stating he would not replace my phone with a new phone.  Josh told me he was the highest ranking supervisor and refused to allow me to speak with someone else at APPLE who might consider my expectations as I was promised.  Bottom line Apple is not what it use to be. May Steve Jobs Rest In Peace.  No more Apple products for me, my family, or friends, I will encourage anyone to stay clear of very expensive Apple products. They will never duplicate Mr. Jobs legacy.

The product was excellent and the service superb. Apple was carrying the Job's service values into the market, backing them up with faultless customer support and offering a genuinely alternative consumer experience. Now, sadly, those values have been lost in Apple's relentless drive for increased commercial expansion and profiteering. The technical consistency that was a hallmark of Apple products has gone - my problems with my newish iMac provide a relevant example:      ‚Ä¢ About 2-3 years ago I updated my iMac just before going into hospital for several weeks. When I returned home I found my iMac overrun with ""duplicate files"". My documents folder had increased from 3gb to over 90gb, my contacts had suffered severe duplication along with several entries being completely deleted. My ""Pages"" library, containing my work-documents, was in a state of complete chaos with duplicated and missing documents. My iTunes library was also in a similar state of chaos. I rang Apple, expecting them to invite me to take my iMac to their store where, hopefully, they would sort it out. No invite was given and instead I was urged to sort it out myself with help from telephone support. So began a long series of phone calls with Apple support - I tried to keep my number of advisors to a minimum but this proved to be impossible. Involuntary ""File Duplication"" is a complex issue and very, very few Apple Support Advisors have the least idea of how to tackle it, instead they will lead you blindly through procedures that will leave you in a state of utter chaos and confusion. Apple telephone support works best with quick-fix problems that can be solved in 10 minutes or so, it DOES NOT WORK with extensive problems that require joined-up thinking over several weeks. If I were to invoice Apple at my professional rate for time spent on this issue (a procedure on which I am taking legal advice) they would find themselves looking at a invoice of several thousand pounds.  My iMac is the last Apple product I shall buy, a consumer relationship that once held so much promise and respect has ended up as the worst consumer experience  of my life.",GB

So I had to waste my time and gas driving 2 hours to madisyn Wisconsin (closest store to me). Before I left my house I called and set an appointment. However little did I know this was just going to make a bigger headache. I get to the store and they inform me the rep I talked to never put in my appointment and I will have to sit here and wait ANOTHER 2 hours. Finally someone comes out and spends maybe 10 minutes talking to me. He tells me that if there is no water damage then I will get a new phone free of charge because I‚Äôm covered under apple care. So I sit in the same exact spot I have been for the last 2 and a half hours. Another 2 hours go by and I‚Äôm getting irritated my phone is still not done. Finally I talk to someone. They take my name and come out with my new phone. They said oh well your phone has been done it‚Äôs just waiting to be picked up. You would think the guy I talked to would have let someone know that my phone is done instead of having me waste yet ANOTHER 2 hours of my time! My phone is now fixed but I am very very disappointed in apple.",US

Black screen, no response, no power up - nothing.  Went to Apple store and updated to latest software, only for phone to repeatedly die, as witnessed by the receptionist person. Receptionist person said if it's a hardware fault we'll certainly replace the phone.  Still had to wait an hour for a 'Genius' to see me to confirm what receptionist had already seen - yes, software updated, yes, phone dies repeatedly with visible screen glitch.  Ran lots more tests to confirm, indeed it was more than a software issue but then refused to replace with new phone.  Insisted 'the process' was that I accept a iPhone 6 on loan for two weeks while they send off the malfunctioning phone. First loaner phone didn't even work, as I noticed before leaving with it. My pleas that any premium brand would normally offer a new replacement on the spot where it's self-evidently not fit for purpose fell on deaf ears.  All the genius could say, on repeat, was 'It's the process' and the even less helpful 'I know where you're coming from'. It would have been more honest to simply say 'Computer says No.' Hopelessly inadequate.  I can't think of any other expensive tech product where the manufacturer wouldn't be falling over themselves to apologise and instantly replace rather than increasing your frustration by giving you the liability of a loaner phone while they muse over what particular manufacturing or parts fault has led to an expensive but rubbish product. I have no idea how long they will take as they couldn't tell me. I only got this because of a manufacturing design error in the iPhone 6 Plus I had before which succumbed to 'Touch Disease' as written about on the internet and now the subject of class action lawsuits in the USA.  Yet more evasive Apple handling of that too.   Having seen the sad decline of both Apple's hardware and the well documented farce that is their software, I can confidently state this is the very last Apple product I'll ever buy, but not the last review I'll write.

The same thing may have happened as many as 6-7 possibly even 8 times in the last few years. The same thing happened. Every time eventually these would be repaired or replaced. Last year in March, my case was handled brilliantly by Xander Jake Mikuda Vest. Once again I had the earphones sent in for repair or replacement. I'm not sure which of those occurred. Either way, I was told I had another year Warranty and to contact Jake if it happened again. 10 months later and it's happened again yesterday - I made a call yesterday it took 30 mins for somebody in Portugal to put me through to somebody in the UK called Janette. I was told on a recorded call that they would be doing the usual for me. I called twice more yesterday asking for an email to confirm this. I spoken with Syresh and Sayeed. I was told it had been processed. Today I called to chase this up and was hung up on several times. Eventually I spoke with Armen Kirakosian  Rather than telling me the status, Armen kept me on hold for 30 minutes and then proceeded to tell me the Warranty is only valid for 90 days and they would not be helping me. Despite what was told to me by 4 different staff members on a recorded call yesterday. When the Warranty on a product is a year and you replace it, you are obligated to give somebody another year to show the product is not faulty. When it has been replaced well over 5/6 times in the past over and over again for the same reason, why am I not being sent a different product or apologised to, for Apple creating faulty products? I expect products to last longer than 1 year which is the original warranty. You cannot give somebody 1 year and then replace it in the 11th month and then tell them their claim is invalid if they get back in touch 6 months later with the same issue.",GB

The rep tells me the line for the previous week was to schedule an appointment to order your battery.... ‚ÄúWHAT?! WTH is does that mean?!‚Äù I scheduled an appointment to schedule another appointment to order a battery???  Then he gets on his iPad to show me that I still have 92% of life on my battery and that I should wait for a new one. I explain to him that my battery doesn‚Äôt last for half a day anymore. He says‚Äô it must be a background app that‚Äôs draining the battery, but conveniently doesn‚Äôt know which one. You mean to tell me that you have an app, that I can‚Äôt download, which can tell the Apple rep the life left in my battery, but can‚Äôt tell me which app is draining my battery usage.... If it smells like bs it probably is.  Lastly, he tells me that a rep will call me in about 2-3 months to schedule an appointment to come in for the replacement battery.  I plan on going in again bc I‚Äôm sure that the next rep will say, ‚Äòoh, your name is not in the system, so we‚Äôre going to have to reschedule your appointment‚Äô.  So now, Apple is trying to convince ppl you don‚Äôt need a replacement battery or you can wait until the end of the year to get it. If you do decide to wait, be sure to give yourself 2-3 months advance time in case they give you the run around.  Obviously Apple had made a big enough mess that they‚Äôll need about an entire year to clean up their mess.",US

I contacted the place that I purchased them and they referred me to Apple stating that the Beats come with an Apple warranty of one year.  I contacted Apple and they were great.  The sent out a box pre paid shipping label and we returned the Beats and promptly received a REPLACEMENT paid.  We receive that paid on in January of 2017.  In December of 2017 the replacement paid broke.  I once again called Apple and was advised that they are not covered under warranty any longer due to the warranty expiring in 90 days for the replacement Beats.  I reviewed warranty information on Apple's wed site and it appears to me that the Beats should have a full year warranty since they are not a year old yet.  I called Apple again and was told that the replacement paid only has a 90 day warranty I said that makes no sense since they did not repair them...they replaced them.  They said even if the took into consideration the original paid that broke in two months were under warranty that warranty expired in September/October 2017.   How kind of Apple to stand behind there replacement Beats by offering to repair them (they don't really repair them they replace them for a cost to me of $199.95 plus $6.95 for shipping and handling which I was advised by the App rep that is still a good deal since they cost more than that in the stores currently.  No it is not a good deal please stand behind your product and cover the replacement of your replacement Beats within a year.

Should I have gotten Apple Care? Yes, and I will take responsibility for assuming the best in the product I spent $1,200 on. Should I have had to assume that after a year and a half of use, the computer I bought brand new would self-destruct internally? No. I'm not talking a display error. I'm talking full-on processor has shut down, and my computer cannot even start. A brand new computer that can't last longer than a year and a half? Also keep in mind that I use this computer for online shopping and Microsoft Office - that's it.  This computer is garbage, and I find it LUDICROUS that I'm expected to pay $575 for repair on something that is not even slightly my fault. If I had dropped it or spilled water all over it or lit it on fire - sure, I'll take responsibility there. You should reconsider your repair process or you'll lose loyal customers.

It was a nightmare from the start.  First, Apple was using a credit card they have on file for me that I can‚Äôt see.  It isn‚Äôt part of any account I can access and for some reason, my order wasn‚Äôt allowed to be seen by my account.  I used Apple Pay to pay for the order - which I‚Äôve successfully used at many non-Apple vendors, as recently as a few days earlier.   The customer service people kept saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre having a bad experience‚Äù  so often that it was perfunctory.  They did NOTHING useful to resolve the primary issue (with the order) or the underlying issue (with the account or credit cards being used).   I ended up canceling the MacBook Pro because it was not going to be delivered in time for my pickup because I upgraded to 16 GB of memory.  I wasn‚Äôt told this would delay the order or asked if this was acceptable.  Oh and they also changed the color from silver (on the previous online order)to space gray. At no time did the service person review the order with me. I spent probably 8 phone calls (not including numerous drops) and at least 8 hours on this order.  One service person, sent me a follow up email with her phone number and extension, but never returned two separate calls with voice messages, even though they were hours before her shift ended. Apple just doesn‚Äôt give a damn and neither do their people. I was also going to try to upgrade my iPhone 6 Plus to an iPhone X, but that‚Äôs not going to happen now and for the first time in 25+ years of buying Apple products, I‚Äôm going to take a long hard look at an Android phone. I am very reluctant to reward bad Apple service. Stephen",US

Eight hours later at noon I got an email with a link to proceed with my order using my confirmation number and phone number. When I went to the link and put in my stuff I got an error that they could find my reservation. After several times of trying I called apple and they said are having problems with the server not responding and to try again on a regular basis and it should work. I did that exact thing and when it didn't work for a couple of hours I called back just to get the same answer. I repeated this process another time before I went to bed. The next day I tried to proceed with the order using the link again every 10 minutes until the reservation had expired (starting from when I woke up (9:30AM) until about 3PM). Keep in mind that I would call Apple support every hour on this day and every time I got the same answer, keep trying and eventually our server will work. Even though for the most part the apple operators were fairly nice, this never worked for me and then once I was within the hour of my reservation cancelling I asked for management, was on hold for 30min and then got hung up on. When I called again it was after my reservation time had expired and when I talked with apple operators they acted like they could not help. They said I would have to place another order and be put in the back of the line. How could they do that when the problem was their servers in the first place!!!!!! I could not believe they could not give me an extension for my reservation or keep true to my delivery date.

I go to the Apple Store, they tell me there is a fabrication default on everything inside my mac, still they change the components (logical board, fan, everything!) but not the mac itself. Today, 1 year after that, the mac won't turn on again. Same scenario, I go to the Apple Store, they tell me I have to change the logical board (which is the price of a new mac) but my warranty has expired... 2 logical boards to change in two years, is this normal? I always took care of my laptop, they assured me at the store that the incident is not my fault, it must be a fabrication default, but since I don't have warranty anymore, they won't do anything for me. 1500 euros for a device that lasts two years, brilliant Apple!

After exhausting everything I have done in the past to get the tones on the device, I called Apple iTunes support where the rep advised me that the IOS 11.0.0 was intentionally designed to eliminate the ability of it's customers from putting ring tones on their phones that they got or purchased from another site or store other than Apple iTunes. That's a darn shame. I will no longer be an advocate for Apple going forward. That's just messed up guys. You should be working to fix all the bugs IOS 11 has. Tons of them, such as the severe battery drain issue I still have since 11 and have even replaced the battery. The phone has been reset and wiped completely - started as new. several  Apple employees at the Apple store agree it is a software issue not including the nice lady in Apple tech support over the phone. Instead of Apple becoming more friendly and nice to it's customers  they are selfish, rude and just are just trying to PO their customers for pulling the ringtone / iTunes store stunt all for only a few dollars.",US

4735,www.apple.com,2017-10-02T17:23:40.000Z,1,I am having an issue with intermittent charging.,"I am having an issue with intermittent charging of my device and an error message saying ‚Äòthis accessory may not be supprted popping up‚Äô. I have it on a range of different chargers and even my 3.5mm to lightening bolt connector.   My phone was replaced by apple 3 weeks ago due to an issue with the battery life on my previous device. So, i decided to take my device back into store to have it looked at.   The genius i spoke to said that there was a lot of dirt in the connector which i was a little less than convinced about due to the phone being so old but i went with it and accepted it as an answer. (Note- my new phone has a smashed screen). The genius did however say that even though this was probably the issue, his manager advised that they would replace the phone for the cost of a new screen. I was confused that he even mentioned this to me as he told me the dirt he removed was probably the issue?   I told him i was not prepared to pay for the screen replacement and went on my way.   I got home and yet again, when plugged into various chargers, my phone continued to have this  error message and so i could not charge my phone overnight as it would randomly stop during the night.   I decided to go back to the store to discuss what had happened. I told the genius in the store of my issues and he stressed that the phone is ‚Äòout of warranty‚Äô due to the smashed screen. I told him that i did not want a screen replacement but i wanted a phone that charged properly. He told me he could not fulfill my request so i asked to speak to somebody that could do this. He told me he was a senior technician and they do not have the power to do this.   As i continued to try and reason with him, even though he agreed with what i was saying in that, replacing the screen does not affect the charger, and so to ask me to pay for a replacement screen was an unreasonable request, he could not change the warranty policy details. He then told me that he was very busy and due to the long queue was not prepared to continue conversation with me and told me to call AppleCare to escalate my issue. He once again agreed that i had a fair point in not paying for the screen replacement however he could not help.   I left the store and called AppleCare where a very efficient call centre worker quickly forwarded me to his manager as he knew he could not help me with my issue. After waiting for a few minutes, i was put on to a lady working for AppleCare and despite explaining my story she also told me she could not help and that my request was unreasonable as the phone was ‚Äòout of warranty‚Äô. After about 10 minutes on the phone to the lady, she asked me if i was nearby to the store i had been in (which i was) and if i was able to put her on to the Genius bar representative that i had spoken to earlier. After waiting for around a further 10 minutes he eventually spoke to her and they finally arrived at the agreement to get me to speak with the branch manager of the store i was in.   My issue was explained by the genius representative and the store manager continued to tell me about how ‚Äòwe don‚Äôt get into the ifs and buts with the customer‚Äô as it causes confusions. I asked him a simple question, ‚ÄòOf i buy a car and it is in warranty and there is an issue with the engine but it has a cracked windscreen, does the car dealer tell me that they will not complete the repair work on the engine until i pay for a windscreen replacement?‚Äô , he replied with ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know about that as i am not a car dealer.‚Äô. I asked him a further question, ‚Äòdoes scratched and dents of the casing of the Iphone also classed as ‚Äòaccidental damage‚Äô? ‚Äò he replied with ‚Äòyes‚Äô. So i asked him why they replaced my other iphone 7 two weeks ago, he told me he could not talk about the previous device.   I asked him if i was to pay for the screen replacement, would they actually replace the screen? He said no, but that the phone would simply be recycled.   I told him that it seems as though apple are aware that there are issues with their phones, however, when they know they need to replace their phones, they try to squeeze every last penny out of you by putting in place biased and unrealistic warranty guidelines. It is not my fault that apple designed their phones in such a way that they cannot replace parts in them. I simply expect to spend ¬£719 on a phone that does one simple thing, and that is charge.   I am extremely disappointed with Apple‚Äôs Customer Service, this is unacceptable behaviour from such a large, influential company.",GB

I told him that I was not going to admit to something I had not done, especially after telling me it was purchased during the hours I was at work. I then told him the CSR already told me she would refund it and was told she did not feel comfortable with this and passed me to him.

When I get it back the laptop no longer works. So I take it back to ask them if they could fix it. They now tell me that the laptop it no longer usable and that I should just buy a new one. They are crazy why would I buy I new when I gave it to them it was working and now it's not.

Although their products look beautiful I find their ever increasing complexity of hardware and software a detriment to their products.  But what really matters is the level and qualification of their support people currently.  I have been presented with conflicting answers to the same issue.  After screen sharing with them new issues arise and the old issue is still not fixed.  I have had support people who can not even understand the problem and have to ask others for advise while I am on hold.  The level of knowledge amongst support is very variable.  For what these devices cost I expect them to work and get seamless support.  I do not expect perfection, the devices are very complicated.  But it seems the right hand is not talking to the left.  And for 4 times what a similar laptop would cost I expect support.  Another issue is the absolute complexity of their web site support pages.  I have counted 5 ways to get in touch with support, and all have different web pages.  Their CHAT while using proper grammar and language gives really poor advice.  ALWAYS talk to a person.  ALWAYS.   Another thing to watch our for is when they update the OS.  Their eco-system is so compliocated and inter-connected it creates ripples throughout your entire computer.

Went through FOUR Senior Advisors.  Not one of them told me or directed me to the page of the Terms and Agreements.   I received a device in return that I couldn't use because it was much smaller than my current 2 Smart Cases.  I didn't want it.  Just because Apple doesn't care about the environment, doesn't mean the rest of us don't.  I'm not putting my perfectly good Smart Cases in the landfill, just because Apple wants to be Corporate Bullies and FORCE you to upgrade to something that you don't want. One Senior Advisor that I spoke to said, ""That has never happened before."" ""You only sent it in for a cracked screen."" I work work in health care.  I wonder how Apple's CEO would like it if his mother, spouse, child or any other relative went into surgery for a simple procedure and came out DEAD and the surgeon told them, ""This has never happened before. Such a simple procedure."" And 4 weeks later told them they failed to read the fine print on the surgical release form. Or if the wrong body part was removed, but that's o.k.

I was on the support line for hours then Apple suggested I return it.  The second imac did not work either. They suggested I return it. This time, as they were suggesting the fault was mine because of the way I backed up time machine data to the new computer, I requested the third 27"" imac be opened at the mac store. A senior technician at Brent Cross London took the imac out of the box. This third imac did not work either.  The senior technician at the mac store then altered something on the imac and said, 'if you get this home and it does not work, I will eat my hat.' I took it home, turned it on, and it did not work. The issue in each case was a lack of bluetooth connectivity, i.e. the mouse and keyboard did not work.  Throughout this entire process I spent 40 hours on the mac technical support line and many of the technicians gave me contradictory advice/suggestions. Since then, I have been using my old 2011 imac that stops me working, everything is asking to force quit. It is a nightmare. Their machines are not built to last anymore. Last week I ordered a 21"" imac and was required to wait in all day for delivery as the UPS did not give an am or pm indication of delivery. they merely stated it would be delivered before 6pm. At 5.40, om 19th July 2017  I called UPS and Apple as I had not received the imac. At around 6pm I logged into the USP update site and it was written that a delivery was attempted at 16:38 and that there was no-one there to take delivery.  My doorbell is very loud and it never rang. I had been in all day. There was no card left for me by UPS, which is what they should have done if they had made a delivery. They made no delivery. I contacted UPS and they offered to drop the imac the next day at a collection point so I would be able to pick it up at my leisure. The next day, 20th July 2017, I was about to leave home when I got a call from UPS to say they would no longer be able to do this, as apple do not allow high value items to be left in these places, so I had to stay in. I then stayed in for the rest of the day and did not receive the imac. Apple then email me around 5pm to say that UPS would now be delivering that day to the collection point after all, so I stayed in all day a second time for no reason. Later that day, 20th July 2017 UPS phoned me to say my imac was too big to be dropped at the collection point and that a delivery would attempted at my home on 21st July. Thus, a situation had been orchestrated whereby I had been forced to stay at home for three whole days on 19th, 20th, and 21st July due to the total incompetence of UPS. The next day, a manager at UPS said my imac had not been delivered the previous day as it had been loaded on the wrong van. This was a totally different excuse. The imac was delivered late on 21st July 2017 and when I told the USP man what I had experienced he started laughing, which did not impress me. He then grew aggressive and abusive, shouted and screamed at me  and then snatched the imac, and drove away with it.  It arrived on the morning of 24 July 2017. I looked at the box and it was covered in stains, and had several dents, broken cardboard, scrape marks. It looked like it had been thrown about severely, and been round the world about five times.  I wrote to a senior manager at Apple but how they seem to do business, is that they never seem to put anything in writing. Last year,  I received nothing from them about the three 27"" imacs that were faulty.  All they do is allow you to speak to their staff on the phone.

The fancy new function bar wasn't functioning, as in it had no back light so there was no way to know where any of the keys were. Despite the assurances that they check refurbished items top to bottom, it was clear that this machine hadn't even been turned on, or if it was, they didn't care. Apple support was useless but did set me up an appointment with the ""genius"" bar. So far, apple had wasted about 4 hours of my time. The geniuses took another hour out of my life. After waiting 15 minutes for a preset appointment (not too bad I'll grant you), the guy took one look at my computer and said it was broken. He then offered to replace it with a brand new mac (joy!) that had half the ram, a slower processor, but the same amount of storage. Apple, I've got to tell you, the ram and processor are the computer now, no one cares about the storage space.  I explained that half the ram was not acceptable and they told me that the only computer they had with 16 gb ram was double the storage and therefore $800 more. I offered to split the difference with them and reminded them that they had sent me the broken machine, not the other way around. They said nothing doing but did offer to give me a refund on a gift card and help me use their website to order a different computer. Thanks, I am not a child and I can use the internet on my own.  So I got a full refund and am looking into a fancy new pc. Apple sent me a broken machine and offered to fix it by giving me a less powerful replacement. No one apologized on the phone or in the store. They are a complete waste of time and a massive disappointment. This company used to be worth the absurdly extra price, but no more.

The edge of the keyboard showed a gap between the table and the keyboard itself. At first I thought it was just a matter of time before it would 'set' to a normal position. After a month it still didn't. Today I contacted Apple online service and that was a disaster. After 43 minutes I just ended the conversation as it was becoming a ridiculous call. At first I got a nice service guy who was helpful but after a while I was transferred to his supervisor who treated me as if I should deal with the matter myself: make an appointment with the Apple Store in Brussels and then drive there myself. I expected them to send me a new keyboard and I would send back the faulty one in the original box which I kept. He couldn't assure me that the Apple store in Brussels would exchange the product or would take it in for repair. I really can't imagine how a smart keyboard can be repaired.

Recently the iPad Pro quit connecting to the keyboard correctly. This made the ipad useless to me. Thankfully it works fine now after Apple serviced the keyboard. I sent mine to them 4 days ago in the box they sent me and received it back today. This would have been a great experience, except it wasn't. I first reported the problem to Apple well over a month ago after trying all the fixes I saw online. Boy was the internet full of stories just like mine.  I was told they couldn't help me until I gave them my serial number off the keyboard which was unreadable. I took a picture and sent it to Apple where they were able to read it. I was then told that if I give them my credit card info they would send me a box to return the keyboard, they would look at it and then decide whether to replace it for free or charge me for another one. I refused to give my credit card info. Please just send me a box and let me send you the keyboard. It took several chat's and phone calls this last month to finally get someone to send me a box. When they finally did I packed up the keyboard and sent it off. 4 days later it was back. When I opened the box I didn't know what to expect because there was no info from Apple. What did they do? Is it a new keyboard? No? Did you fix it? Looks like it. Now all is well. Except that given the option of an apple product or a non apple product I will NEVER EVER BUY ANOTHER APPLE PRODUCT BECAUSE I DO NOT LIKE HOW YOU TREATED ME!!!!!!!!!!!! This includes the 2 iPhones, 3 iPads, an iPod, and hundreds of dollars per year on iTunes. I have seen the light and it shines on a rotten apple.

Speaking as someone who has owned a variety of  laptops by a multiplicity of companies, Apple is not worth the money, and I'm no longer convinced that it is the best option for the money. My advice is to go with something else. Anytime you want to add any type of content onto an Apple product, it's practically an act of Congress.

As it was a gift bought on the online store, I had to call AppleCare to get a replacement.  My experience with AppleCare has been horrendous, I spent more than 3 hours with them on the phone for achieving nothing. They were supposed to send me a return form, they never sent it. They considered my case closed. On the site my iPad was considered as sent back. When I reached on the online chat, they could not help me because my case was considered over. So I called again AppleCare, filled again the whole form over the phone. And once again never sent me the form!  I went into the store to ask for help, after all I just wanted to return my iPad... so why was it so complicated? The staff was dismissive and told me that I had to call AppleCare and they could not help me. The thing is they kept telling me to call them, that this was the best thing to do. But I did not want to anymore, I was going nowhere with them. And there was no other way to reopen my case as the retail store did not want to help me.    Having no choice - according to the Apple Store staff - I called them once again, filled again all the information because even though it was the third time they still did not record any information. A senior manager talked to me and told me my email was wrong and they never realised that over the 10 times I told them and made them repeat it to be sure they wrote it correctly? At this point I had no more trust in them.  I finished the call, and I received a invoice for a new iPad arriving on the same day... I don't want to pay for a second iPad! And I still did not get the return form.  AppleCare service is bad. Just bad.  In the end I did not manage to send back my iPad or get a new one. I just got rid of my iPad. This experience just disguted me of Apple. I have no more trust in their customer service. They blocked the return process, closed my case, and were not helpful. In total, I spent about 6/7 hours with Apple customer service off and online... and got nothing from this exept a massive headache and two bad days.

The only thing offensive is the company's attitude towards it's customer base. Please allow me to explain.  We own many Apple iPhones and other products.  I visited the Evergreen Walk store in South Windsor Ct  on June 23rd to amongst other things, purchase an iPhone.  As we completed the very long and horribly tedious process of purchasing the phone using the 0% monthly payment plan, My 770 credit score was denied.  Yes that is right DENIED.  The ""process""  includes recording your drivers license, your credit card for automatic charges to your account, and collection of your SS # and birthdate.  I work very hard to maintain excellent credit but 3 years ago I was sued for $274. for a medical bill I disputed. I lost (I could not make it to court that day) and paid the $274 to the undeserved medical company for a duplicate payment for a medical test.  ALL that information becomes a part of your credit history.  And yes my credit score is still 770, since it had occurred far enough in the past.  I even very recently refinanced my mortgage and took out a home equity Loan on my house without any problems.  Citizen One financial however does not review your credit, if you have an unsatisfactory score or in my case a ""judgement"" you are denied, period.  Neither company apparently has anyone smart enough to read a credit report.  Citizen One claims that the standards are put in place by Apple, not sure I believe them though.  I spoke to both companies customer service they each blamed the other, big surprise.  I blame Apple for allowing a company mistreat it's customers in such a demeaning way.

Here is my story, which happened on May 13, 2017, from 1:40 pm to 2:20 pm. Repair No: R234957421.  A few days ago, when I dropped my new iPhone 6S the first time ever, its screen has shattered. After that, I place the iPhone inside the protective case, and a week later I took it to Apple Yorkdale for screen replacement. Inside the Apple Yorkdale store I stumbled across many poorly designed business practices and procedures which make Apple customers look stupid and guilty when actually they are not. LIST OF EVENTS: 1.The black guy who accepted my phone for repair, take a close look at my iPhone, but did not draw my attention to any scratches, and even did not mention about them at all! He just asked to read a half page of text and put signature on a touchscreen. Me, as many of you, made a mistake by not reading the text carefully, thinking that it was a standard legal bla-bla-bla and I just signed it. 2. When I received my phone from repair, I noticed the scratch in the LOWER RIGHT corner and reported it to the dark beard guy who was releasing my iPhone after screen replacement. I expected that Apple will replace the scratched part, and that‚Äôs it. The guy printed out the Genius Bar Work Authorization form, which to my great surprise in the ‚ÄúProblem Description/Diagnosis‚Äù section stated (quote):  ‚ÄúIssue: Custormer reports Phone fell and glass cracked Steps to Reproduce: Visual verification MRI. ‚Äì pass Cosmetic condition: Display cracked ‚Äìimpact point TOP LEFT Light surface scratches Employee 1130550164‚Äù I did not remember any scratches in the LOWER RIGHT corner, and I firmly believed at that time that there was none when I passed my phone for repair. I asked the dark beard guy to contact the black guy who took my phone and confirm with him that there was no mentioning of any scratches before repair. He answered that that black guy had already left and cannot be reached. I am not that stupid, and I am sure that this standard ‚ÄúLight surface scratches‚Äù phrase is either automatically inserted by the Apple software, or routinely inserted by Apple employees who take iPhones in for repair, as insurance from customer complaints about pre-existing scratches. I understand their point, but it makes all customers automatically guilty when accidental scratch is made by Apple employees. Just do not tell me that it never happens ÔÅä Here are the flaws in Apple business procedures when my iPhone was taking in for repair (and I suspect they are systemic flaws for Apple as a whole): -Apple employee did not draw my attention to pre-existing scratches; -Apple employee did not take pictures of the iPhone‚Äôs back and sides which would allow Apple to prove its position if a complaint is made;  3. I asked to speak with somebody from the Apple store management team. Some grey beard guy came to me. His body language was explicitly saying: ‚ÄúDude, stop wasting my time!‚Äù Again, he referred to the ‚ÄúLight surface scratches‚Äù and said that he cannot help me with my complaint. Finally, I was asked to sign a two page long legal disclaimer, which I have read carefully this time, and I made a handwritten note above my signature about the newly discovered scratch. Here are the flaws in Apple business procedures when my iPhone was release after the repair (and I suspect they are systemic flaws in Apple as a whole): -The employee who was taking phone in for repair cannot be reached; -The touchpad for customer‚Äôs signatures is oversensitive, and it took me SEVERAL attempts to right my comment above the signature because several times I accidentally pressed the ‚ÄúClear‚Äù link on the screen; -The employees who participated in the conflict resolution discussion did not introduce themselves, and I am almost sure they are not added their notes and employee numbers to the Genius Bar Work Authorization form as a conflict resolution participants. I hope, that somebody from Apple will read this feedback, and pass the flaws to the upper management for review. Overall, this visit to Apple Store changed my impression about Apple to worse, and their employees do not look trustworthy any longer for me. I hope that my complaint will make potential customers think twice before purchasing from Apple! ----------- MY ADVICE TO APPLE CUSTOMERS: Take in the Apple store another camera, and make pictures in presence of Apple employee before passing them your Apple product for repair!",US

Updation my IOS software was impossible for an error message. 2. After plugging my phone to my pc, I could not open it anymore, requesting me to update my phone, noting that the update was not working. (This state remained for few hours) 3. After talking to support, it opened, only to give me an activation lock screen, requesting me to put my first ever Apple ID password used. (Unfortunately based on password requirement (upper case lower case, number etc, I couldn't remember my password.) 4. Chat support can't solve this issue (which makes in my personal opinion at least little sense). Anyways, so I had to wait for 2 days until apple support calls me. That was due May 2nd 2017 at 10.45am. They call as promised at 10:50am, I answered and after 30 sec the line cut off on his own. No other attempt was made. Its 12:01 pm as I write this review..  5. From 10:50 am till 12:01pm I am trying to contact support, by chat and call. Error messages kept coming.  When attempting a call, it gives me a error.  When attempting chat, it keeps loading with nothing coming up. At the same time, another error kept on coming (403 forbidden) when I press contact support.  6. I go to my email, and see an email from support telling me they have been trying to call me, but receive voice mail.  a. I never ever had voice mail on my phone, and its a service I don't even have on my phone. b. How come I was contacted the first time successfully with no voice mail. Yet my phone didn't ring since. 7. In any case, lets forget phone attempts, I try contacting support on the emails they sent me, I keep getting automated messages that this email doesn't get checked. Even when the personal assistant Savannah and Chelsea both talk to me on chat, and one of them even sent me a personal message by email, the thing I couldn't do. Conclusion: It is quite obvious I am writing this while being emotionally stirred, and even a little angry, 3 days to solve a very simple thing and its the problem that came from something I can't control (the update) and the errors that came with it.  Plus if I may add something, if we users change our passwords because we forgot them, how reasonable is it to be able to unlock my phone with a password I forgot, even though a new one is working!!!  Please look at this apple.  And even giving authority for people on chat to solve things is much more easy for users without going into the hassle of appointment for a call. In short, I am a dissatisfied with all this, and its only naturally I am, after I have stayed patient for 3 days.  I am editing this now, its 14:16 pm, and I finally succeeded in applying for a call without an error, I received 6 phone calls, after applying for a call as much, yet after I press 1 to connect to an advisor as they say, the line cuts off.  This is a lot.. what more to say.. Editing again. Its 18:34 p, seems I have to throw my phone, because of security protocol. Cant even write anymore to explain.",US

This was extremely annoying because he stopped to hug every employee with brief conversations. This continued --while we THE CUSTOMERS -- waited because our staffer had joined in the cheering and clapping for the duration of this activity.  Ok -- I get the team connection, but Apple, there would be no team if not for the consumer.

4894,www.apple.com,2017-04-13T09:10:02.000Z,1,Faulty Cable and the rest.....,"Faulty Cable - First of all, having been an Apple business customer for many years and at last count I have 8 i-pad's, 1 mac and 10 I-Phones (all new and get replaced to latest when released) I find it frustrating as to the service I received from my local Apple store. I have had one faulty cable replaced with no issues in store within the last 10 years. I brought back in a faulty cable to the store yesterday to be told straight away from the advisor that she would not replace it. I asked for the manager, the manager came and also said he would not replace it as he deemed the cable to be damaged. I admittedly said I should of taken the 2 mtr (¬£30 cable) back sooner when the outer sheath first showed signs of it splitting but due to work and not having time off I took it back earlier  bearing in mind the cable is only 4 months old. The manager stated as in their (VMI) they would deem the cable as damaged, don't ask me what VMI means as the manager never knew either. I asked to see the guidelines several times but was refused. A guy from the Geeky bar was requested to inspect the cable and it was obvious from his manner that he was going to say the same thing. Apparently if you look close enough with a NASA telescope you will be able to find the serial no on the cable in which they were unable to read in store. The guy also started nick picking on marks on the cable barely visible to the human eye, I'm still looking for them.  I was advised that the only solution would be for me to contact Apple support and send them photos, bearing in mind I had now been in the store for 2 hours and it had cost me ¬£4.50 in parking let alone fuel and time to replace a faulty item under warranty. I then went home and called Apple Support to speak to an understanding Irish gentleman who understood my frustrations and was keen to get the issue resolved although he required the serial no of the cable. I had to try and locate the serial no and call him back but without the necessary telescope of microscope it was impossible. I called back to speak to another advisor who asked me to take photos of where we thought the serial number was so she could have a look. We took photos of the cable and sent them to her and there were no surprises when she could not read the serial no either. Having now spent 6 hours trying to return a ¬£30 2 metre cable she agreed to send me out a replacement. Having now experienced this I'm sickened at the support from the local Aberdeen store and as I said to the manager he has now forced me down the route to purchase imitation cables from Amazon in which I can get a 2 metre cable for ¬£6. If any genuine customer ever goes back with a faulty cable I really hope you do not have to go through the pain that I had to go through. I will now be purchasing imitation cables from now on as well as reviewing ways with my IT company to look at changing over our devices from Apple to another system.  I would not be writing this if I never felt so strongly about this.",GB

Took it in and after an hour and a half were told they'd opened the phone up and found the water damage marker had gone off and they put it back together without a new battery as they couldn't guarantee the phone.  The phone was working perfectly when we took it in, we weren't aware of any water damage (apparently even being left in a bathroom can set this off!!) but now the phone won't even switch on.  Apple's attitude is that we should've taken out extra care policy and then it could've been repaired or replaced otherwise we will have to pay for the repair/replacement - fair enough but what they don't get is that the phone was working perfectly before it was taken in and didn't have a problem apart from the battery!

If a third party product & it goes wrong they immediately go into deflect & total non-responsibility mode. Under British Law they must replace a product with 30 days. Outside this retailers have discretion to repair or replace. Apple will try & make you feel like you're being 'unreasonable' by 'evoking' the Sales of Goods Act & only after an argument, offer to replace a product. So if you have an external device which has data you need to recover they won't help you by liaising with the original manufacturer. You're on your own.

I was that stupid to pay such amount in hopes for a well functioning Product without headaches. Guess what! The mac started behaving weird after about three weeks. It started freezing and it only got worse and as I write this review, it's completely dead now. I have been in tears on phone explaining the problem to apple, I have spent time/days and weeks worth more than the price of the iMac - trying to troubleShoot the issue. After about 12 months in agony I told them this must end now so I need to annul the purchase and buy another computer as my family couldn't live like this anymore. It was at this point that they reffered me to a local repair shop. I carried the heavy machine to the store who retained it for about a week and yet the problem wasn't fixed properly. Apple has trained their workers to act like robots. There're  no human understanding or feelings of any kind at all. All you get is a very sweet ""hooker-like"" lovely voice who starts the conversation in a way as if they understand your problem but all you get is; ""I can see you've been having the problem for a long time now, I'll do my best to help you now. I'll be the one to deal with this from now onwards. I'll call you back..."". On the other hand I even got a response like: ""we've never got any complaints from anyone before. Even if you know of any complaint then it's a drop in the ocean compared to how much we sell without any complaints"". My screen completely failed and turned black three days ago. I called in crying for help. I received the usual robot-like response saying the problem is a bit too complicated so they would have to hear the opinion of the engineers who made the software and whole design of the iMac then they'd give me a call back latest the following day, which was yesterday but one, but no one has called me back yet and we're at the end of third day. There's no cooperation with Apple. Once they've got your money for their overly priced products, you're on your own. Apple really sucks when it comes to after-sales services including customer care. As said, the ""sweet"" telephone  voice only works when the issue is easily fixable. Otherwise those who give more than one star in review of apple would regret it badly. Now all I have to do is to file a complain to the consumer board authority and this may take all from six months to one year. So where does it leave me? I am forced to go and invest in a new computer while waiting for the case to be handled. Apple is not even moved by this message from me. Shocking indeed how a company of this size can treat people like crap while strapping us of millions! NEVER BUY APPLE products unless you're sure it'll work throughout the duration you expect to own it or unless you have too much money that you don't care about losing! Because you will never see that money again if the product fails. I mean NEVER!! You lose in all ways. In my case, I have already lost more than what I paid for the product , so even if I win the case with the consumer board, I'll never recover the time spent chasing for it, the headache along the way, the documents lost during troubleshooting and reinstalling the computer, the daily growing frustrations, etc. I have lost big time!",DK

One of the biggest issues they have is tighter scrutiny over app developers; especially those who charge users for upgrades. They need to self regulate before governments across the world start looking into practices around in-app purchases. There are quite a few companies making huge amounts of money using clever marketing tactics and Apple is taking it's fair share of the profits. iOS users deserve to be better informed on value for money. Some of the games on Apple Store cost hundreds of pounds of investment to make real progress and gamers should be warned about this before committing any time or money. Apple could provide a breakdown of how much people spend on each app (on average) as a guide. There is nothing more frustrating for a gamer than supporting an app, only to find they need to spend more and more for max rewards. It is so easy to rack up ¬£20, ¬£50, ¬£100+ on a game before you realise you have been had. Apple and app developers need to be more transparent and provide customers with better value for money.

4934,www.apple.com,2017-02-08T09:34:56.000Z,1,Robbed By Apple,"So I've never really been into Apple; I think they're overpriced and I've always thought of them as quite a snobby company.  However, my boyfriend loves them and convinced me to try out their products.  So for Christmas, he bought me an iPhone 6 and I bought him an iPhone 6S, the new Apple TV, an Apple controller and the new iWatch, totalling to approximately ¬£1750.  I am one of these people that hate paying for overpriced merchandise, but I thought, for the price, at least they should be decent and last a long time.  And I would've assumed, after spending that amount of money, that Apple would give a s@*t if there were any problems.  How wrong of me.  At Christmas, my boyfriend opened his watch and was over the moon, but it would barely fit on his wrist.  We joked about how they must of made them for super skinny wrists!  However, a month later, we found out that Apple make watches for women and men (although they deny this).  So I emailed them and said that I wasn't very happy because I had obviously bought the women's watch, despite saying to the sales guy that I was buying it for my boyfriend.  I told them that my boyfriend was thinking about selling the watch and buying the other one, which is really heart-breaking for me, because it was so much money.  ¬£400 is a lot of money, obviously not to them, but to me, it's a ridiculous amount.  And there's only about ¬£20 difference in the two watches, so obviously I would've liked to have gotten him the bigger one for the extra ¬£20, but I wasn't given this option from their ill-informed staff.  So, I got an email from them about a week later saying that they don't do men and women's watches, just different sizes of the screen and if I wasn't happy, my boyfriend should sell the watch and put it towards a new one.  I was absolutely gobsmacked.  Firstly, do you not think I should have been told that there were different sizes?  I know nothing about Apple, and they should assume that for all their customers.  I went into their store to ask for their help, specifically.  Otherwise, I would've just ordered online (which I wish I would have because I probably would've been given more information).  Secondly, they obviously didn't listen to a word I said, because I told them I did not want him to sell the watch.  It actually makes me feel gutted and to tell a customer to sell their brand new item, instead of making THEIR mistake right, is disgraceful.  Actually disgraceful.  Who in the hell do they think they are?!  I would've actually been more agreeable if they had said that there was nothing they could do.  But to tell me to sell it.  I still can't get over it now.  What shoddy customer service.  Obviously once they sell you their overpriced products, they don't want to know any more.  I don't think I've ever felt let down more by a company and it just solidifies my views on these sorts of companies.  Never again will I shop at Apple.  Shocking customer service, if you can call it that.",GB

Next day I wanted to see it again and to my surprise it wasn't there anymore and my order was gone. I forgot to write down the order #. I found the film at Blu Ray.com where it costed the above mentioned price and I  see they have raised it to $ 17.99 today with no improvement.  There site on Google is not the same as when ITunes is opened, all mixed up. I learned that I have to write at Google, the name of the film + itunes, click at the film + click what resolution you want then click at the shop and you are there.

I had no alternative but cancel the appointment.  I then tried to get another appointment to no avail, eventually calling Apple to try and get one or to see if they had a priority booking system for their faulty batteries.  They don't and they don't care as they have already sold the phone.  Before I spent 5 hours on a walk in appointment, I called AppleCare to find out if the Apple store had replacement batteries.

After two months of using it, I noticed the home button would just get stuck, wouldn't work for a whole day and then automatically go back to working the next day. This happened three times in a row! When my phone just randomly went off on New Years day and heated to a point where i couldn't even touch it, I decided I really needed togo into the apple store and get it checked out by a professional.  Note that  I'm an extremely careful person, considering I have had an iPhone 5s for three years with no damage. So when I took my brand new phone to the apple store in the UES, one of the guys at the genius bar tried to diagnose it and he failed, they could not get it to even power on. He confirmed with me that there was no water damage, scratches or any kind of cosmetic damage on the phone and mentioned that it is mostly a defect in the interior of the phone. He assured me that I would not have to pay for it since it was no fault of mine and said they would have to send it to the service center to investigate the problem.  When I received an email a week after that my phone was ready for pick up I was absolutely excited. I went to the store only to find out that they were charging me a $347 for a replacement for the phone. I was dumbfounded as I did not expect to be charged for a replacement as it was not my fault at all.  So i asked to have my phone back thinking maybe i could have it repaired elsewhere. But they refused to do that and said they cannot give me my phone back. The exact words said to me were, 'You either pay and walk out with the new phone, or leave without a phone."" I was furious, believe me I still am. I asked for some kind of proof, or a report stating there was a physical damage with the phone, but he had none. Now I have never had a bad experience with Apple, but for the first time I feel cheated and lied to. I beleive it is not okay to do this to customers. It's so sketchy and I find it hard to understand how there would be damage considering I did not drop the phone/wet it and there was not a single scratch on it.  I did leave paying the $347 they asked me to, but I left unhappy and unsatisfied. I left feeling cheated.

The branch technical support defined the phone as faulty, so they replaced it with one that they classed as 'new'. However, it looks to me as though it was somebody else's phone due to the fact that somebody else's email keeps appearing on the phone and requires a password, which is not my email.

I purchased a new iPhone 6 less than two months ago. The purchase experience was great and I have loved the phone until this weekend. I didn't really intend to do the newest update, but one of the frequent requests to update caught me and I allowed it to happen. Immediately I had issues. My phone died and would not restart. Yes, I tried pushing the home button and the on/off button for 10 seconds...I got the apple logo, then it died again. I tried holding them for 45 seconds while plugged into iTunes and got the update/restore screen. Unfortunately, the phone would not update or restore properly. I tried the online Apple support and got no help other than mentioning the things I had already tried. His solution was to try a different computer. Eventually the phone actually did go through a total restore and then update from my last back up using the computer I had been on all along. I was frustrated to have spent 6 hours messing with it, but relieved to have my phone back. I went to bed more happy than not. In the morning, I overslept because the phone had died again while plugged in. We were back to square one...black screen, apple logo fading away...ready to cry or scream or both, I made a Genius Bar appointment at the location 45 minutes from home. I know I am lucky to have one that close, but it is still quite a drive when coupled with the two and a half hours spent in the store. The technician was ok. She did what she could but couldn't fix the phone. She eventually said I would get a new phone, but then said oh no, wait you only get a loaner. We have to send this one in to be repaired. That means when it comes in or when they decide they can't fix it I will have to take off work and go back in to the store. The loaner they provided to replace my phone with 128 GB of memory as 12 GB. It won't download all the apps I use for work. I have deleted almost all my photos and still no luck. I am so frustrated. I paid for a very nice new phone with tons of storage, I bought the Apple plan to protect my phone and my wallet. What did I get in exchange? Two nice enough tech kids (one on line and one in the store) who could not help me and a sub par phone that doesn't meet my needs. Let me stress both the tech were ""ok"" by that I mean if everything else had gone right, they would have been fine, but when someone is stressed and needs support they failed to deliver. In fact the tech at the store left me sitting for over an hour with no contact after she brought out the lousy loaner (which she told me was identical to my phone).  I have wasted two days of my vacation dealing with this issue already and will have to take time off from work to go back when Apple is ready to give me a new phone or give mine back. If they return my old phone to me I will never trust it again or use it in the way I have in the past because it totally let me down and caused me to miss an important meeting by dying in the middle of the night. My husband and four kids are all due to update and had planned to get iPhones again, but I don't know if I can allow that.

His immediate response was that there was no way to fix the phone and that I would need to pay for a new one if my phone is out of warranty. My question to him was why would a customer have to pay for the phone and then buy a new one due to a design flaw? His response: You don't, unless you're out of warranty.

Shocking afterservice for a phone thats worth over 1000 euros. Such a poor service from once a very good company.",IE

First of all I was very happy to hear that over the Christmas period they extend the returns policy to allow for the Christmas period so I purchased knowing I could return if the gift wasnt right. In the end I did have to return but their online chat service made it extremely easy for me to return the item - they set up everything on my behalf and instructed me exactly how to get the product returned and refunded.

Because of the balance it would not let me update my FREE apps. I am waiting for a new bank card and they insisted I pay the 3.47 or there was nothing they could do. I told them it was wrong double charging me but I would pay double that at this point just to stop the madness. They insisted there was nothing they could do unless I had the new bank info or went out and got an iTunes card. They put me on with a senior supervisor who said the same thing. After four hours of this I finally told them I was an apple customer for 8 years either credit me and take it later which would have been double billing or drop the darn charge. I said at that point do you really want to lose a customer over three dollars. miraculously they dropped the charge I literally 30 seconds and I went on with life All this to update my apps.

I paid $600 for it, plus I am paying TMobile for service to use this thing. Apple locked me out of my Apple ID, which rendered my phone unusable. I went to iforgot.apple.com to get a password reset, which put my account into ""Recovery"" mode. I've been waiting for 15 days. 15 days with no phone! A phone I paid for, brand new. This is not some locked ebay phone. It is one I bought from TMobile, and I have the original receipt with the serial number. I should be allowed to use my device.  I've had 3 phone calls and 1 online chat session, and no one from Apple seems able to help me. They all want to start at the beginning and walk me through all the steps that I have already taken. My account is already in recovery. Don't keep sending me to iforgot.apple.com! Please just unlock my phone! Alas, no one at Apple knows what's the verification process entails or how long it will take.  Meanwhile, my calendar, contacts, and even flashlight are locked up. So, Merry Christmas to all my contacts who I can't reach. Sorry, or the events I miss because I trusted Apple with my calendar. And my credit card is sorry for the TMobile bill I have to keep paying in expectation of getting my Apple account going soon. I'm also sorry for the prepaid cell phone I had to buy to tie me over until Apple releases my iPhone. I wish Apple would have better communication and warn people that ""Find My iPhone"" is no helpful service because it forever links your phone to an Apple ID, and if you get locked out of that ID you better kiss your phone goodbye.

I wasn't impressed when I was told I would be called back and never was but then I called again and spoke to someone named Daniel Lomholt. I was very impressed with the way he dealt with the issue and I was extremely grateful that he was able to solve the issue quickly without any fuss. He was very polite and apologised for the fact that I had been misinformed and messed around.

Extremely disappointed about PayPal and Apple customer service,"I tried in the last 1 week to buy and apple watch, as a Xmas gift for my boyfriend from the famous Apple website with their PayPal Credit which it is supposed to be ' Easy and instant '. I tried a many time, every time they replied Sorry PayPal Credit isn't available for this purchase, so I just wanted an answer why if they have the offer on their website, right?? so I went in Westfield Shepherds Bush apple shop centre to find out an answer but the people there couldn't give me a proper answer, the only thing they could do it was to suggest to call at the apple phone number from their website so i did that, neither the guy on the phone couldn't help at all, he neither wanted too, he just rushed me away. Then I tried apple Live chat a guy James, this time very kind guy, tried to help and he asked if i made any changes on my PayPal account, and i did, I confirmed again another card, as I thought maybe thats the reason isn't available for me, so James told me i need to wait 48 hours for the accounts to sync. Right, so i waited then tried again, still purchase not available.. I went back on live chat to ask them again, a lady told me better to call paypal. Great, I tried to call paypal but they have an almost non- existent customer service, call centre customer service it is open just from 8am - 4:30pm, or there is another phone number, where a robot answer your phone call and will keep you hours on the phone for nothing.. just repeating same nothing, sorry that‚Äôs the truth.. he will never transfer your call to an operate person, so it‚Äôs just waste of money on an international call which keeps you forever. I called the second day 8am to speak with an operate person.. first one transferred my call to Paypal Credit department where i was waiting forever, no one picked up the phone.. i hanged up after 15 mins, so again waste of money on international call, and i called again, and finally another guy came with the answer.. after so many days and so much time and money wasted i found my answer why PayPal Credit isnt available for me.. My PayPal account was originally made in a different country than UK, the only think I needed it was to have an UK account and then I could apply and got my answer. So now my answer to them is: the people working for customer service in these two biggest companies in the world, they really don't care or they really don't know what they do!!!!

As a family we have now gone over to Apple totally (phones, lap tops, desk tops and pads).  Buying from the Apple Store has always been quick, efficient and friendly, and I have yet to find anything out of stock (that's 6 laptops, 2 desk tops, 9 phones and 4 iPads over the past 7 years).  The products last well and have only been replaced due to damage or loss (two laptops, one iPad  and 1 phone) or upgrades in the case of phones (all of the computers still run well).  We have had very few technical issues and the odd ones we have had have be dealt with quickly and free by the Apple store!   Example today (upgrading my wife's MacAir) - we'd like a new mac air please, certainly madam give me two minutes, job done.  We are thinking of having the old one serviced to give to our son, how much do you charge (it is over 5 years old)? Oh nothing madam, let me pop it upstairs while you wait and they will clean the fan and keyboard and check the version of the software and do a virus check while we get the details sorted for your new machine. Fifteen minute later - all done, but we have noticed a slight flaw in your screen on the coating...  Ahh... is that a problem, sounds expensive.  We will need to put a new screen on... sounds very expensive.  No - although it is out of warranty (by a century or so!) this should never happen and we will do it for free - we will need the machine for a couple of hours while you have coffee...  Now - if that is not service what is?  My experience with Sony (my pre-Apple computer of choice) was a disaster.  They would side step every fault (in warranty) where possible unless threatened with legal action and took on average 6 weeks to fix anything.  Apple 10, Sony nil.   I wouldn't buy anything but Apple now.. They are very good, they are expensive, but the service we have had has been faultless and fast.",GB

It used to hang, it used to freeze the sensors didn't respond. battery used to drain quickly. So for the same reason I went to the service centre to get the issue fixed they gave me a temporary fix by restoring my phone and when I asked for diagnosis report they gave me and excuse and stated that I can come later if the issue persist as its working fine for now. After using it for another 3 months the issues got more severe, the phone used to get dead for 10-15 minute applications used to crash the battery problem stayed the same, sensors were not responding on time and even my phone got freezed for good 24HRS until the complete battery drained and luckily I was able to  take screenshots of the application crash and the application not responding timely. I went back to the service centre, spoke with someone named Sandeep showed them issue and he said its normal and they will test it for 2 days. I came back and called apple support after 2 days and spoke with Shourya Anand, he called the service centre and they said the phone is ready and they have restored it again and when I asked what was the issue they said it was a software glitch nobody was able to give me alogical reasoning, I insisted that the same thing happened earlier and every time I cannot restore the phone so Shourya insisted me to wait for 2 days as will ask about the diagnostic report and he will call me back. I waited and called apple support to remind them, Shourya called and said he will call me back but he never called me with final report. I spoke with Alisha there after and they said they are working n it and Shourya will call me back and I called back again on the next day and spoke with someone named Nikita I asked her to call service centre to check whats going on and they said they cannot call now so I hung up and ten later i called again and spoke with Himanshi and they said service centre people cannot replicate the issue which i had so its fine now I told her that i have sent the screenshots of phone clearly showing the issue but they still didn't help me. Finally i had a word with Arijit and told him about the same and requested a supervisor he promised that he will look into it and will ask for diagnosis report from service centre and asked me to wait for 2 days so i started waiting and in the mean while i received a call from manager Kaushiki who stated that service centre never ran a diagnosis test and they just restored the phone and they are waiting for them to diagnose it and asked me to wait for Arijit's call. Arijit called me back after 2 days when I called them and reminded that I am waiting and he called me stated that the device is working fine and now the service centre couldn't replicate the issue and they kept on generating diagnoses report from the day 1. I asked him to share diagnoses report and he denied and stated its confidential. Manager's and representative's statement did not match and they kept on lying. My phones diagnosis report cannot be shared with me, there is no logic behind it. Apple support experience was pathetic I paid a good amount for my phone and still they could not provide me average customer service. Apple products and service are pathetic. I neede help and I called several times and nobody helped me nobody gave me a logical answer nobody gave me a reason nobody told me that what exactly was wrong with my problem and what caused it. I reminded Apple support reps to call me back and Shourya Anand gave me his email and when I asked to call me back on he I didn't even reply to it.

5002,www.apple.com,2016-11-22T18:45:46.000Z,2,Great hardware but terrible service,"The support service from Apple seems to be taking a nose-dive recently.  Here's a run-down of an issue I've had (and am still having) to give you an example; I have a lot of Apple kit; watch, iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, Apple TV... you get the picture - I'm familiar with the devices. My iPhone 6S has been having terrible problems with it's battery recently - since around September the life is poor and it shuts off unexpectedly and suddenly, sometimes when it's as high as 60% charged, and so I have to carry a battery pack around with me everywhere, just in case.  I find that I have to recharge the phone at least twice per day, sometimes three times.  The battery is also on occasion running very hot.  Consequently I contacted Apple a number of times, both in stores and at the support phone centre for help and advice. So far the advice has consisted of; Reboot it (duh - think I haven't already tried that a million times?!) Erase and restore it Restore it as a new device rather than from a backup   The various people I've spoken with have run their diagnostics and reported that there are no errors and the battery appears to be fine (although my experience shows it's far from fine), and so as they can't diagnose a fault they won't repair or replace. Finally this week, after months of battling with the issue Apple have announced that they're aware of a Shutdown Flaw affecting some iPhone 6S devices which has exactly the symptoms I'm experiencing, and so I gleefully called the support team, as I can finally get some support on the issue.  The support guy I spoke with was actually very good and checked my serial number and confirmed that mine was in the batch which has the fault, but really all he could do was book an appointment with a Genius bar as the device would need to be repaired or replaced.  I confirmed I wished to have it replaced as the overheating battery may have affected other components, and realistically I have that option under the UK's Consumer Rights Act.  Unfortunately there were only 3 slots open in the London Covent Garden store, a week away.  As I really wanted this resolved sooner the advisor suggested I drop in to an Apple store and speak to a manager, as it was a relatively easy resolution; simply swap the device for a new one - Apple already know it has a manufacturing fault so no diagnostics are needed. As advised, I dropped into the London Regent Street branch (slightly easier to get to for me than Covent Garden) and asked for a manager, and was directed to a Mr Sharma. The 'manager' seemed to have difficulty understanding the story and was intent on making me a Genius bar appointment, for which he had a 5-6 hour waiting list.  I tried to explain that I didn't need any technical help, I just needed a replacement, but he wasn't listening.  He was rude and dismissive, and when I told him that I didn't want to wait for 5 hours he told me to leave the store as I didn't have any business being there if I didn't want to have technical help or buy a product! As I'd been unsuccessful at Regent Street I proceeded straight over to Covent Garden and again asked for a manager, adding some background for him and my thoughts about how Apple support was worsening - he didn't like that I wasn't happy with the service, but instead of sympathising and trying to recover the situation he seemed to become aggravated - not a great way for a 'manager' to deal with a consumer.  He did, however, get me to a Genius bar technician about an hour later. When I finally sat down with the Genius bar technician he didn't perform any diagnosis, he simply booked it for a replacement (which could have been done on the phone, or by any of the members of Apple staff I'd spoken to already), however as it's their standard policy booked it for a recycled device, despite my understanding that I would receive another new device to replace my faulty one.  As they don't hold stock I have to return in 3-5 days to swap it over. After leaving the store I checked with Which's legal team and they confirmed that under the Consumer Rights Act I do have the right to demand a brand new device, as that's what I purchased, and so I called the support team again.  After spending 40 minutes on the phone with them the senior advisor finally worked out that I'd need to speak to Covent Garden again about ensuring the replacement was for new and not recycled and transferred me to the branch.  A woman answered, said 'hello? hello?' and then hung up. I'm on to the support team again, this time I'm 24 minutes in and still nowhere. Not sure what I have to do to get Apple to resolve this.  Right now I'd settle for them even fulfilling their legal obligations. After decades of using Apple and tens of thousands of pounds of expenditure I'm about ready to stop using Apple entirely.  Great hardware but atrocious customer service when things go wrong.  It's hardly 'it just works', it's more 'when it doesn't work it's a nightmare'.",GB

I asked the employee a question and he literally started yelling at me in front of the entire store. The entire time he was talking he was just repeating the same thing over and over again as if I was too dumb to understand what he was trying to say. It felt like he was trying to get rid of me as soon as possible. I am not kidding I felt like crying because his tone was so harsh. I was appalled at his behavior and I honestly cannot believe that anyone would ever pay him to talk to customers. If I was his manager I would fire him immediately. He is an absolute atrocious disgrace to Apple and I seriously hope he loses his job because I never ever want to encounter him at the Apple store ever again.

I went to the store in Belfast Victoria square 3 times today. First time I went I was told I would need an appointment so they booked me a walk in appointment, I was distressed with the lack of my phone as now a days you need it for everything and depend on it which in a way is quite sad. So the girl told me to come back after 11:40 and since my lunch was between 12 and 1pm, I went at that time. I didn't get seen to and became very angry as since I was a walk in appointment and was told I would only be seen to if someone was free but aside from that I got ignored. I then went in the evening after work where I said that this is my 3rd time and needed my phone to work or something to be sorted. Luckily a kind fella said ok that's fine and was very apologetic, offered me a seat and then just explained that within 20 minutes someone would be out.  Luckily enough a girl named Katherine came out and helped me with my issue. We had a nice chat and due to her discretion of me since my phone wasn't in bad condition, she kindly gave me a replacement phone and waived the fee even though it was out of warranty!!!!  I can't thank Katherine and the store enough as now I am sorted and it's like my old phone never broke. I see the negative comments and understand that but in my own experience I can't think of any other company who would be so kind to give a free phone out of warranty!!  Thank you!!! :D",GB

If you know how to use their devices,"Most people complain about Apple but still have an iPhone, iPad etc.  Most problems arise from not understanding how to use these devices therefore most people complain about what is essentially their own error in not backing up the device properly before updating etc.  I use Apple devices for business and the way iCloud syncs is brilliant! They are simple to use, easy and very user friendly! I've also found their customer service to be of a very high standard too. Of course it has its problems but nothing is perfect but I'd never go back to anything Windows again if I could help it. MS anything is clunky, slow, updates every two mins when you least need them when needing to finish an important report etc. Plus a nightmare to back up and restore! Why can't everything be as simple as Apple! Technology should be fun, not require a degree in rocket science to work first. Yes they are expensive and work needs to be done to make things more affordable but hats off to apple for making computing fun and stylish again.

So now I'm on the lookout for a Samsung phone or something, and my MacBook won't be replaced with a mac - windows will get that order, that is for sure.  The reason I got a mac was because I didn't like the constant pop ups and my computer is old now, and I must admit that it has been living a 6 year life.

I have provided a bank statement, email from Amazon confirming the purchase AND an email with an invoice from the original company that supplied it to me.

How many receipts are on non official letterheads? Loads. Get real. It's a proper audit trail that would stand up in court any day of the week. Look at the till receipts you get from supermarkets, shops etc. Are they not proofs of purchase? Of course they are.  They essentially want me to buy another product from them. I REFUSE TO DO SO.

He needed to leave hotel on 24th. I had called into apple support and asked them if the phone would be delivered on 23rd since he needed to leave and they promised it would! 23rd Sept (a few hours before expected delivery) they call me and say it hasn't left factory and will be leaving shortly. I tell them I need it delivered today and they said it should reach if the delivery is 23rd. I wait till EOD and no phone.  I call again and explain the scenario to a new support guy. He tells me I can go for pick up option. He checks the store next to hotel and says there have the phone in stock in that store. I was like, book it. This happens at 10.00 am. Friend needed to move to different hotel post dinner so he could pick it up by 7.00 pm. Support guy tells me it will be available by 2.00 pm. I agree and book the phone. 4.00 pm, no mails about pick up ready. I call up again and they say they are preparing the package. I call back at 5.00 pm and same answer. 6.00 pm my friend goes to store, and they still didn't have it ready!!! They make him wait for an hour and still are doing things on the inside. He leaves at 7.00 pm without the phone! I get an email on 24th that the phone is on its way and will reach on 27th. I call them immediately asking them to cancel the delivery. Support guy tells me they will try calling UPS and stop the shipment. I agree and wait for their update. Still no call. I call them back and the new support guy doesn't see any of my previous conversation so I have to explain all over. I ask him to give me a call back after talking to UPS. He calls me back saying UPS are on their way and there is no way to cancel the shipment. I will need to return it once the phone is delivered. They give me a support manager to talk to - Mel. I call the hotel staff myself and tell them the story. They say they will give it to UPS person (as shipments come in daily) for return. Phone gets delivered to hotel on 27th and the hotel agrees to return it on 28th. I call Apple again giving the update. Now, Mel tells me I need to call back after a few days to confirm they got the phone. I said NO WAY! I need you guys to call me and update me. 4-5 days pass (4th Oct) and no calls. I track the delivery and phone has been delivered to their factory 2 days back! I call them for 6th or 7th time and Mel casually say oh yes, phone was delivered blah blah. I was like, this support sucks. They made a mistake to send it out late, then didn't give a s*** for return. I was like I need my refund since my credit card payment date is on 11th Oct. Mel tells me they will check the phone is it is not damaged or not used, etc and then confirm if its good for a refund. I lost it, totally lost it. I was like it wasn't even opened! Mel still doesn't give a s*** and says I can't help you. I call back on 7th Oct asking for an update. I shout this time and let them know enough is enough. Now, the Mel tells me that he will call the clearance department and get back to me. He calls me back in 2 hours and tells me I should receive a refund in next 2-3 days. On 9th Oct, I get an email saying phone has been cleared and I should get a refund within 5 business days. This also contradicts the promise made to me by Mel. So, I was supposed to get the refund by 14th. I still haven't got it and I called Mel YET AGAIN. He tells me it's been 6 days and I should have got the refund already. He calls back in an hour and tells me the ADMIN guy who is supposed to post refund didn't do it till now and will do it now. I was like what the hell is wrong with you guys!!! Nobody gives a s***. Now, I need to pay my credit card bill with more charges and I still haven't got the money back.  SUMMARY - No phone through online booking or store pickup, wasted money on both the options, had to call 10+ times. Got refund for pick up store phone but still no money for online booking. It's been 8 days and still nothing!!! This is the WORST experience ever!!!",US

5022,www.apple.com,2016-10-12T10:51:24.000Z,1,I Pad and I cloud warning,"My I pad has been my computer and companion since 2012. From the moment I unpacked it and switched it on I was sold. The move back from Australia to the U.K. has been difficult but my I pad has kept me informed and in touch. For my needs which are e mail, web browsing, you tube, music, and photos it has been superb.  On several occasions I've researched a back up device and almost bought an expensive wireless system which I was led to believe would store and back up my I pad content. I never did purchase one and I'm still confused if spending the ¬£100 plus pounds would have been the solution because I kept getting conflicting information.  I recently returned from Australia with many superb photos of family, friends and snaps of the places I lived in Australia as well as some stunning images including early morning balloons passing overhead on a cold winter Melbourne day. These images are all now gone and will only remain as memories in my head. Over 4 years worth of electronic photos, my entire photo library except for 55 of the most recent shots have been  wiped. A week or so after returning from Australia my I pad froze. I couldn't switch it off. It was re booted at the Apple Store but my photos came back as blank grey squares. At first I wasn't too concerned and my brother advised to keep it connected to power and they will eventually download. This didn't happen. Stupidly confident I returned to an Apple Store and the consultant advised another re boot. Same grey squares but no photos. His advice was to call support where the advisor was pretty useless. While on the phone to him and scrolling through all my blank photo squares I was still extremely confident that my photo library was there somewhere and could be WOULD BE RECOVERED.  Shortly after this call all my grey squares vanished. I will never know why those grey squares which were at least evidence that something had been there suddenly disappeared. This was the moment that I felt empty and lost. In fact I felt physically sick. Over 4 years of my life which I believed to be safe in the cloud, ALL GONE.  A senior consultant, who has been an absolute gem to deal with as have most of the Apple staff has now left a message telling me that engineers are unable to recover my images.  While waiting to speak to someone at the Apple Store I was explaining my situation to a youngish Apple employee. She abruptly cut me off saying I haven't got time to go into this now adding and this is what really pisses me off......WE ALWAYS ADVISE YOU TO BACK UP TO A COMPUTER. Excuse me......MY I PAD IS MY COMPUTER. I Don't have a lap top and I CLOUD WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MY BACK UP.  I feel absolutely devastated because I loved my I pad and I trusted I cloud. It's crazy to think that we have become so connected to these electronic devices and very sad to be left feeling so empty inside. As empty as my photo library. Apple should not be selling I pad on its own and should be making it clear that you need a mac book as well if you want to ensure your stuff is secure. Hopefully the market will determine how much longer Apple can continue to be so expensive and so arrogant. To think I was about to up grade my I pad but what's the point without having a mac book as well and I can't afford it. I could keep my current I pad hoping it won't freeze again and invest in a mac book but why should I have to spend all this money. Money I don't have and why should I spend another penny in an Apple Store. Update on my case with Apple. As expected I've been told that my I cloud was not configured correctly to save photos. If they mean by configured switching on I cloud photo, then it's ridiculous to think that I would have gone into settings and left it off. I've also checked their terms and conditions. Of course they cover themselves completely in large capitals while in small print state it's your responsibility to back up to another computer. My I pad is my only computer. This is not just about the loss of my photos, it's about the trust I placed in the company and their products. I will never buy another Apple product. It won't make any difference to them but it will save me a lot of money.",GB
5023,www.apple.com,2016-10-06T19:02:25.000Z,1,Disgraced by Apple's Customer Service,"Unbelievably dire service from Apple Store Bromley over the last couple of weeks. We booked an appointment for a screen repair at 12pm on the 25th September, which was to be reimbursed by a third party insurance company. We arrived 10 minutes early with the anticipation of being seen early or at least on time. We were told to sit down and come back up at 12, which we did. The representative signed us in and notified us that Apple's systems were down on that day, but that they should still be able to proceed with the repair, it would simply mean that they'd need to do more of the paperwork manually as opposed to electronically, which was fine. We ended up waiting for 45 minutes for someone to call us up to the Genius Bar (you could see the frustration on everyone else's faces). The guy that we spoke with ran us through some paperwork, quoted the work and told us to return at 2:40pm and it should be done (2 hours for the work, which wasn't too bad given that this is the time they suggest to allow anyway).  We return at precisely 2:30pm and let them know that we were there to collect the phone, but were happy to wait given that we were a little early anyway. After being told that it shouldn't be too long, we then went back up to one of the reps at 3:15pm to inform him that we had been waiting for well over half an hour. He said he would go to check for us and never bothered returning to let us know what was happening.  Finally at 3:40pm the engineer came out with our phone. At this point he explained that due to the fault with their systems, he would need to put the receipt down as a gift card receipt. We explained that we were planning to make an insurance claim and he told us that if we called when the systems were back up and running, they'd get us a receipt no problem. The following weekend, we called Apple Customer Service. The representative told me that she was unable to help, but if I emailed the Bromley branch they'd get back to me within 24 hours. Surprise surprise, 5 days later and we've heard nothing even still, so I called them yesterday evening instead.  After 45 minutes on the phone, I was told that they weren't able to do this but decided amongst them that the insurance company ""should accept the statement of work/quote and the gift card receipt combined"" (not sure who they thought they were to decide the insurance company's policy for them). I absolutely insisted that they produced a receipt for me and the rep decided that she would speak with the store manager.  Finally, she came back and told me that he had agreed to get the receipt across to me first thing today, on the basis that the store was closing and he didn't have the resources he needed at the time to do it. At this point I was truly disgusted at the service that I had received from a company that has one of the largest customer bases in the world, and arguably one of the largest yearly revenues as well. I have contacted my insurance company this evening in the anticipation that they MIGHT accept the quote and gift card receipt combined, however the rep told me that this would be unlikely but to give it a shot regardless. I am pending their answer, and to this moment have not received an ounce of help with Apple. If it was not for the fact that Apple produce such innovative technology, I would not use their services in a million years.",GB

Yes, this review was written with anger, but again, we're drawn back to my statement about fairness, but to be ""just"" as well. I try to give the new updates a chance, for one, they're too frequent to ignore and one (myself) starts to see a decline in performance to where I'm forced to upgrade, and for two, I'm hoping that Apple will fix their gaps in their operating system. Each time, I'm disappointed and I've been with Apple for years. Loyalty keeps me here as opposed to switching to Android, but I've thought on many occasions to just doing it anyways and saving myself the headache of another ""iPhone release"". I understanding having to keep up with demands of a fast paced market, but it gets to a point where you guys start to overlook the needs of the customers to fill your own pockets...and call it capitalism all you want, but it's the consumer that keeps the company at bay. The IPhone 7 is a joke and I have an IPhone 6. I haven't even had this iPhone long enough to be comfortable, let alone think about an upgrade. The replacement of the headphone jack was ridiculous and all part of some ploy to give the phone something ""new"", but again ""unnecessary"". Marketing Apple Wireless EarPods? Really? What if they fall out? Is there a tracking system? Or perhaps an automatic refund when they're lost in the shuffle of life? I doubt it, Apple, I doubt it. Have several seats and just enjoy being a great company that honestly does make great products. You've substained your name already and it's known worldwide, so give your users a chance to enjoy it, otherwise continue to decline in not only my eyes, but a slow gradually accumulation of other users as well.",US

It even got faster than it was, when I first unboxed it, due to the OS X updates, released since then. No Windows PC/Laptop I had (and I owned one or two over the last 10 years) was nearly as good as my Macintosh computer. But it's not just the products that make Apple good. The customer support is great and you get a lot of goodies for free. I actually don't even have to use any 3rd party software on my mac, if I don't want to. You get everything you need for free, like a complete set of office applications. Customer support is great. Contacted it several times the last 5 years. The first time, 2011, I had a problem with my itunes account. The support answered the same day and helped me with my problem. I also got a gift card for the music store, because my library was accidentally deleted. Of course they also restored my purchases and my library! Needless to say that I'm quite sure that I won't be buying any smartphone or computer that was not made by apple in the future.

After my experience (explained below) with Apple product and their customer service, now I feel, that my decision of not buying any Apple product is absolutely correct. Due to the demand from my daughter I bought an iPod Touch (I think Gen 6) in Nov 2015.  It worked fine till July 2016. One fine day, it just died!....  We thought that the cable is the problem so bought a new cable.  Did not work.  Changed the charger, did not work.  All in all, we tried all possible ways to revive it but all in vain....     We took the product back to PCWorld (from where we bought the product) and they told us to contact Apple for support. Lets begin the sad story.... We thought of visiting an Apple shop which is 45 minutes‚Äô drive away from us.  Thinking that we'll get our problem sorted!  Since we are new to Apple world we didn't know the rules to follow.  In the store we were told to contact Apple Customer Service and they don't have any appointment for that day!  What?!  Appointment?!.... My wife contacted Apple customer support over the phone.  She was given a case number (D207607179) and yes due to an error on our side (i.e. she did not have the Apple ID and password) we had to call back again with the required details. Second time when my wife called, the English language knowledge of the customer service executive was pathetic.... My wife reached to a stage (after around 40 minutes) where she asked the executive to transfer the call to another person who can understand/speak English. We were told that someone will come and collect the product.  Nobody turned up....  When we checked the repair status online, we realised that we have been shipped an empty box from Apple and we have to send the product back. We have not dropped the iPod or something of that sort.  It just stopped working.  On the other hand, I have a phone (Asus) which is lot cheaper than an Apple product (and lot better than Apple product).  I have dropped it numerous times, it is still working absolutely fine. We think, the process we have to follow to fix a simple issue is like killing a bee with a sledge hammer‚Ä¶.

They checked in my item with receipt (and registered serial online), and they were mailed back un repaired as best buy only services beats products from their store. This is unbelievable and totally a great reason why I do not support this company in the least. I guess way less then the little I did before. But if you buy a company and assume the warranties, you should give accurate information on where to get them mailed out for warranty. I told the best buy associates to throw them out as it was my mistake for wasting my money on a product from a company that has no care for product support.

One week ago Apple brought out the software update IOS 9.3.3. Trusting their advise, I downloaded and tried to install the update, after which my iPad was impossible to reactivate.  I searched the internet and found lots of advise: restore using iTunes, try another lightning/usb cable, - try another Mac. I even tried an older MacBook Pro, which wasn‚Äôt updated to the latest version of El Capitain (we keep it as a secure backup in case new Apple-updates downs the network, the necessity learned from rather expensive bought experience). After everything advised was tried and lost, I rang Apple support Denmark. They asked me to go through the same steps once more (If you don‚Äôt, we unfortunately are not able to help you any further). Ending up with the same ‚Äòunexpected error‚Äô they told me to go to the local Humac store and ask for service.  The Humac staff told me, that sending it in for service would cost an x-amount of money and probably wasn‚Äôt worth it, but I could pay close to DKK 4000 and get the same iPad-version back in a completely new state.  So I rang back Apple support DK, asking if they would either promise me free service or a price reduction buying a new iPad. Spending another 57 min‚Äôs, having to go through the same steps (If you don‚Äôt, we unfortunately are not able to help you any further), again ending up with the same ‚Äòunexpected error‚Äô, I was told once more, that my iPad needed service and I should take it to the local Humac store.  I went through the arguments of having bought an iPad for close to DKK 8.000 jan 2013, I‚Äôd even bought the Apple Care Protection Plan with it ‚Äì and after this latest update, it was impossible to use. The lady of Apple support DK told me, that it probably was a hardware fault and no responsibility of Apple, and therefor they were not able to offer me any help, reimbursement or whatever in the matter. I asked to talk to a supervisor and was later called back from Ireland a very kind and understanding man, who unfortunately also was not able to offer me any help at all, besides taking my iPad to service and paying for it. The fault or ‚Äòunexpected error‚Äô had nothing to do with the update, but was probably a hardware problem, that might have been there from the very beginning, however, surfacing now with this latest update. He understood my problem, but unfortunately ‚Äì since it was not the fault of the update or Apple ‚Äì he was unable to help. He did however agree to the fact, that Apple produced the iPad in the first place, and that Apple also brought out the update, that ruined it or ‚Äòcaused the fault to surface‚Äô. He also reminded me, that when I downloaded the update, I had agreed, that Apple was not responsible for any problems occurring in its aftermath.  That of course is true. I believe, I once read an article stating, that if you actually read all the conditions of downloads, transactions etc, you would have to spend an equal of 78 days a year reading the small print. I know, that I have no legal grounds of my claim, but never the less: 10 days ago I had a perfectly working iPad at the age of 3.6 years. Now I have spent at least two hours at the phone, 1/2 hour upgrading and several more trying to fix the problem, I have gone to the local store etc. And I am so angry. In my view Apple either produced an inferior product or ruined it by an destructive update. Either way: Apple is not paying ‚Äì they leave it all to me.

But I've had enough of their customer service. They're happy to charge premium prices but give the kind of service I'd expect from McDonalds. My iPhone 6 plus (which gets normal-moderate use, no games or heavy stuff) started developing battery problems just over a year after purchase. The battery would only last 5 hours or so and would drop suddenly e.g. from 70% to 30% in seconds.  The genius bar told me that it was probably a known software fault that would be fixed in the next update, and if that didn't work, they told me to set up my phone as a new account to make sure it wasn't a software issue (thanks! years worth of apps and data lost - a fair solution?) So I did all that - same issue. I came and they told me that it was normal that my battery was dropping fast -eg 30% to 0% instantly, because of my phone's age (under 2 years!). Their diagnostics tool showed the battery at 86% of new capacity. Yet they believe it was normal behaviour for a battery to have large sudden drops, so I had to pay for a new battery! I requested that under UK consumer law they replace the battery for free, but they said no, that it only applies if the fault is made known to them within 6 months of purchase. That's not what the law says - the burden of proof shifts to the consumer, but I would have thought demonstrating the issues I was having are proof enough.  Just feel ripped off. A phone this expensive should last 2 years of normal use without extreme battery issues. It clearly seems like a faulty battery to me. Thanks for nothing Apple.",GB

Not only were they rude about it but they denied me and told me that it was my fault cause I didn't ask the correct person on what the warranty status was when I clearly asked the person checking my computer into repair what will the warranty entail when it comes back I was given a document that clearly says that I will have a 90 day warranty with my computer when finished with its repair Now they are saying they don't want to honor that time period that I am basically SOL I have contacted Apple Customer Executive Relations about this matter and we shall see what they have to say later on today I was told i would be getting a call in my opinion I think it's people like (SR Customer Relations) Alison King that ruin things for everyone and gives Apple a bad name. I think all Apple should do is Fix/Repair the Computer they broke from the beginning.... If Apple reads this and wants to make things rite here's my email support @maxintoshenterprise.c o m,US

I think when paying ¬£300 for a watch that surely it should look cosmetically good after 6 months and that paint should not be peeling within this time as had I know I would never have paid that amount for something I could wear occasionally to keep it looking good . I have baby Apple products within my household and am really disappointed with this item I have lost all faith in Apple and would never recommend there watches to anybody especially if you are considering wearing it daily,CA

5076,www.apple.com,2016-05-19T15:19:34.000Z,1,Extremely RUDE customer service at Apple Store Reading Oracle UK,"Extremely RUDE customer service in Apple Reading (oracle) UK.   my brother has a Mac book pro that had the same technical problem that I had with my old Mac book pro (which is from the moment of purchase it made clicking noise and then after about 5 months of using it, It suddenly turned off and stopped working)  Took an appointment with Apple and they said they'll need to change the hard disc which will take about 15 minutes, I agreed and waited. While I was waiting I thought of paying extra and changing the Mac book pro with a the newer ""Mac book"" since the last time I came (when this problem happened with my laptop) the genius who was helping me advised me to get a new laptop rather than fix it since he said this is an old laptop that we don't make anymore, and if it clicks from the start, it might always have such problems (and I did pay extra and get  a Macbook with Retina display)  So after the genius came back I asked if I can do that, he said ""nope"" I asked why not and he said ""we don't do that"". I should have gotten the hint that he was being rude by giving such short answers, but I didn't and explained to him how they did it with my old laptop. He seemed like he wasn't even hearing what I'm saying (felt like he thought I was lying when I said I did it before) and when I finished explaining he said ""no. we don't do that if you like I'll get you someone else to talk to"" and then looked at his watch like he doesn't have time to talk I said yes that would be great thank you  No you're welcome no nothing , he just left and after 10 minutes he came back and a manager came with him.  I said Hello, how are you .... do i need to explain what I'm asking or do you know?  He answered ""I already know and it's not happening"" (In the rudest way EVER) and the genius staff beside him starting smiling and raising his eyebrows (like a 5 year old) and both of them had extremly rude body language.  I was in shock.  I had the recipts opened on a laptop to show him that i did get the old one and then paid extra and got the new one, so I told him (the manager) ""but why not, that's what happened last time and I was able to change here are the recipts""  He said ""maybe you got lucky, i wasn't there then now I'm saying no""  (I called apple service they were very shocked of such claim and said there's nothing based on luck, they have the same procedures that all Apple stores follow)  After he said no, I said ""but listen let me show you the recipts"" (because I felt he didn't believe that it happened)  He answered in the most impolite way EVER ""don't tell me to listen I'm listening and even if you show me the recipts nothing's changing""  At this point I had no words, He was Extremely RUDE and him and the genius were standing in fort of me and looked so angry I even felt a bit threatened.  I told him in a calm tone ""that is very disrespectful, I'm not talking to someone that disrespectful please go"" he said ""okay"" and I told the genius to get me someone else to talk they both answered ""he's the manager haha"" ""there's no one else to talk to I'm the manager haha""  I didn't move from my seat since I was in tears I'm not used to anyone talking this way with me and felt really threatened that I froze ( I also still needed to put the Laptop in my bag also I wanted to get there names so I can complain to Apple).The genius guy came back and told me ""I'm going to get you someone else to talk to is that ok?"" I guess at that point they discovered that what they did was wrong I agreed a new manager came (remember at first they said there's no one else to talk to..)  The new manager was polite apologised on behalf of the other one and tried to find a valid reason for why they won't change the laptop but couldn't (I guess he just didn't want to change the laptops because the other 2 said no and now if he agreed they would look like they made a mistake) anyway, I thanked him for trying to find a valid reason but that it doesn't make sense and told him to give me there names.  Here are there names  Paul (the genius. He's short, black hair and wears glasses)  Alex W (the rudest manager and person I've ever met in my life)  And Tom Ryan (the other manager who tried to help at the end)  I'm a student living alone in Reading, I have no family to protect me here and I avoid problems at all costs. I did not even imagine Apple customer service to get to such a low level to the point that I felt threatened by how they talking, stood, looked and behaved   this was the worst Apple experience in my life, they ruined my whole day and I could sleep at night just remembering what happened. Also not only did I feel threatened I also felt they were (at least the first genius ""Paul"") racist since I'm an Arab and he knew that (the apple laptop was from purchased from Dubai and my English shows I'm not British) and I know he was looking down on me for being an Arab (which is disgusting of him).  Hope you take such complaints seriously, since Apple as a brand will defiantly lose a lot of its customer services become this bad (and I checked the facebook reviews for the Apple Store in Reading and most of the reviews had 1 star this should indicate something to you).",GB

Result? I took Wednesday off to accept delivery and set it up but when it looked like it wasn't coming, I phoned Apple. Really sorry but there's a stock available issue, but there wasn't when I ordered and paid for it. Will it be delivered Thursday? We'll get it sorted. An email arrived on Wednesday 23rd @ 17:25, expect delivery on the 30th. This was after I agreed with my boss to take another morning off to take receipt of the iPad. This is 7 days after the initial date promised date when you buy the thing. I doubt I'll still be home in 7 days. Buying this now looks like a waste of time. This isn't the first time this has happened to me either, recently I have bought an iPad mini for my daughter, I think this was 4 days late. Then I bought another mini for my mother-in-law, I think this was 5 days late. This is not an isolated issue. Been on the phone again today & the lady I spoke to was very helpful however the result is that it won't be available till the 30th. When I pointed out this was a breach of contract, why accept payments for products you don't have, just send me out a new one. She went to talk to (I think) 2 managers who said Apple is not at fault, delivery will be the 30th & if that's not good enough, cancel the order and buy another one.  Even if I thought this acceptable, what guarantee do I have that this one would turn up this side of never? Will I end up with the same limp wristed excuse? Probably.  So unfortunately because I don't want to waste anymore time phoning or do a 70 mile round trip to the nearest Apple Store, I am effectively, humped! I was looking at an iMac Mini for my son who will be starting high school after the summer, a replacement tablet for son number 2 at Christmas & probably a new mini for child number 4 as she doesn't have a tablet and is nipping my ear about Minecraft. However if Apple can't even manage to sell & deliver properly, what chance do I have if there are any product issues? This experience is pushing me toward Samgsung because none of these devices are cheap and I now don't have much confidence in Apple, nor do I want to waste more time dicking about on the phone when clearly floor managers don't appear to give a toss.",GB

March 2016 video card burned out (computer has always run really hot, and Apple says they will fix this, but not replace the video card unless I pay for it).  Turned it in for repair 03-09, and was told it wold be ready no later than 03-13.  It's now 03-18, and they ware awaiting arrival of the cable to fix the overheating problem, and have no idea when it will arrive, hence can't tell me when I can get the computer back.

Now, I have to spend more for a new video card than the computer is presently worth, to get it back, and it apparently takes 9 plus days to get it done.  Hey Apple, I've got an idea, why don't you use some of that 200 BILLION dollars in accumulated profits you've amassed at your customer's expense to maintain an inventory of spare parts so you can fix your products in a more timely manner!!! I originally bought Apple products because they were well designed, easy to use, somewhat intuitive, and were less prone to viruses/malware than the alternative.  But, lately, Apple products seem needlessly overloaded with too many bells and whistles that I suspect 99 % of their customers don't really use, and they aren't nearly as intuitive as they once were.  And, they have become seriously expensive.  I wouldn't mind the expense so much if they still delivered top line customer service, but this experience is causing me to consider returning to PC's.

Multiple faults.,"Extremely poor customer service.   Repeatedly lied to about products, waiting times, repair and replacement. Staff untrained in the product line and unable to deal effectively with defective products they are selling.    Macbook pro under a year old returned to shop and was told the wait might be an hour. In the end had to wait 5 hours to see a 'genius' and then a further hour of 'tests'.   Finally was told the macbook had a faulty GPU and would have to go in for replacement board. Four days later when the macbook was returned had to wait again to see anyone before I finally got working macbook back. Used it at home for twenty minutes and then fault returned.    Phoned the store and was assured that they would issue a brand new replacement as they had already attempted the repair and failed.    Of course this was a lie. again more waiting, more 'tests' - was told that the new board they had inserted was itself faulty.",GB

Apple doesn't even have the courtesy to at least contact the customer to show that it at least still cares after my previous complaint.    I was a PC user for a very long time and recently decided to switch to a Mac thinking it may be better quality. What a mistake! First month of having the unit, the external HDD kept disconnecting and the tech support people blames it on my VMware Fusion software. I guess it's easy to just pin everything on the customer. I didn't even have the software running most of the time and yet the external HDD would just drop off.    A few weeks later, I changed my Apple ID Password and this was my biggest nightmare -- I had to type in my password 10 times each time I open iCloud, email, notes, contacts....etc. It seems like the keychain utility is corrupted after resetting my password and somehow ALL my saved passwords and certificates are gone! This is not the end of it. I had a VPN subscription software and my license had 1050 days left. After the keychain became corrupted, the system somehow removed the license and now my software wouldn't work no more! Today, I tried to log into my system and the CAP lock lights were OFF but yet it seems like the CAPs are still really on. My wife tried our password five times and almost got ourselves locked out of the system because of this.    Our family has been loyal iPhone users for a long time and we sincerely believed the Mac would be a good product but we were REALLY wrong. In addition, we just found out that Apple's App store software are often more expensive than those of Google play.

When I got to the store I spoke to a female worker, she told me to go speak to a male standing by the door and he would book me in with the genius bar. He told me to just hang about the store until someone came and got me. I waited absolutely ages. In that time lots of staff seemed to be hanging about doing nothing, a few times people came in that they obviously knew and they would go away and speak to them. I got bored waiting so went and asked one of them what was happening and he had no idea why I was told to just hang about. He then told me to go upstairs and speak to a young guy at the top of the stairs. He thought I'd only just arrived in the store as no one had let them know I was there, even though the guy I saw at the door said he had.  I eventually was seen by a 'genius' he barely even looked at my phone. He looked up my details on the computer and said 'Oh, it's got a major fault and as it's a few weeks out of it's warranty it will cost ¬£199 to repair' he then suggested I just purchase another new phone as 'In the long run that will be cheaper' I left the store and took my phone to a few smaller phone repair stores.

As a non-techie with copious reservations, I was pleased with the service that I received from salespeople Cristina Twitty and Brian Velez.  My visit started with Cristina, who is the consummate professional.  She was extremely patient with me.  My past experiences with laptops have been so dire that I was left skeptical about spyware and malware and the whole internet experience.  I had many questions, and although she answered all of them, she didn't mind, and even encouraged, my asking all the questions that I needed to before investing in my purchase.   She answered all of my questions until she was absolutely sure that I understood all the points.  She went beyond the call of duty by going to different Apple experts to explain certain points to me to ascertain that I understood what my purchase of a MacBook Air entailed.  My concern was mostly about malicious spyware and malware, and she asked several experts to explain everything to me until she felt that I was comfortable with my imminent purchase.  I left the store assured that I made the best purchase.  Cristina's selling savvy was stellar!  Then she made sure that Brian Velez introduced me to my MacBook Air.  Brian was a joy to learn from, and he was so patient with me.  His great disposition put me at ease, and he also answered all of my questions while teaching me how to navigate my new MacBook.  He was a delight!  Both salespeople were beautiful spirits that I had the pleasure of learning from.  I have  never had such a pleasant experience making a purchase.  I will definitely go back to the Apple Store for any technological purchases that I need, and that is a credit to two wonderful salespeople!  Thank you for a wonderful experience!",US

5142,www.apple.com,2015-09-30T00:59:33.251Z,2,Caring and Keeping their Customers,"I am a brand new customer to Apple as of this past year. Apple was always something intriguing to me that I wanted to learn more about as I grew up with all Microsoft products. Within the past year I got a MacBook Pro, an Air 2, and have been contemplating the IPhone 6S. I had one rough patch when Apple Care would not repair the MacBook that my son literally sprinkled his sippy cup over when I had by far worse accidents repaired by Geek Squad at Best Buy with no issues. Long story short, we ended up working out a compromise, despite the surprise with their lesser coverage in comparison. When it came to Apple, I had superior expectations with everything do to so many positive reviews from products and customer support. Also, with the price point to what most would consider a premium quality product. Tonight really took the cake. I had an absolutely DISGRACEFUL experience with the closing manager at the South Windsor Connecticut store.  Let me start with the fact that I have been working in retail for at least past decade of my life now and I know that more and more of large scale corporations are leaning towards online sales. This is out of ""convenience"" to the customer (or in my opinion a way of hiring less store employees across the board in a company), companies have set their sales up so that a customer can purchase an item for a quick pick up that very same day at a nearby location. Again, this is supposed to be a ""convenience"" to the customer. So, tonight I did just that and purchased a typical IPad Mini that most all Apple locations readily have on hand. On the order it said ""Pick up: Available Today"". It did also state that there would be a confirmation email when the order was ready to be picked up. I did not have time to wait as I only had the free time to pick it up before the store closed so I headed in that direction thinking logically as most would that how much time do they need to get a stock item on their shelf ""ready"". Heck, I don't mind waiting a few minutes for them to prepare things if need be. I headed in and they greeted me after a few moments and I told them that I was ready to pick up my item. They started to look it up, but couldn't find anything which made me concerned as I process credit and loans in my retail position all the time. So, I understand the speed in which transactions process electronically and had the expectation of Apple being an efficient company. The young lady who helped me, called Apple Online Customer Service to question it further. During the end of that call, so she proceeded to tell me that the order was placed on a 24 hour hold for fraud which was even more upsetting. I glanced at my email on my phone to see that the order had processed on my credit card . She then advised me to call Apple Online Store back to speak with verification (rather than connecting me herself to someone).  I called them back myself to get a woman who told me that it takes 24 hours to process the sale and there was nothing they could do other than have me drive back tomorrow (which was a time that I was not available after already driving an hour round trip to/from that location), but that there was no holds or fraud notifications on the order. She suggested that I spoke to a verification specialist about the fraud and then transferred to me to a menu that kept asking me to punch in an extension which further frustrated me. I then asked the young lady in the store if I could speak with a manager who could help clear things up as I had come so far. So, this older man who was the manager that evening immediately confronted me after speaking with her. He aggressively asked if I had received the email that it was ready for pick up. I said no, but it said ready today and I did not have the time to wait before closing. He cut me off and argued that I was wrong for even bothering to come in for that item without any confirmation of it being ready. At the point I purchase that item, it is MINE. I should not have to be told when I can have it when I am a paying customer. That 24 hour hold is a CROCK if I ever did hear one. I sell orders for thousands of dollars in my retail position via online for immediate pick up in store. My order was a measly three hundred something dollars which any fraud department would have squared away in no time. I said maybe I should of bought it from Best Buy and they would let me pick it right up. He encouraged me to go ahead!! He continued to argue with why I was wrong (something that you should NEVER do in retail with your customer). He then just turned his back to me and walked off as I called my friend asking what I should do as I was extremely upset and on the verge of canceling it. If it wasn't for the fact that I am leaving the state before this weekend and this wasn't a gift for my friend who wanted this particular device badly, I surely would have! This has been one hell of a first year dealing with Apple and I am completely turned off.",US

My MacPro zero key stopped working and I soon realized how often it is needed including in my case to bank as my client card contains a zero.  There is no Apple store near where I am currently located, went to Fairview store in Toronto; was told I needed an appointment; given one for height of rush hour at Don Mills and Sheppard, 6 p.m.; returned and went to Genius Bar and was told that I needed a new keyboard and repair would take up to 2 weeks.  The queue might shorten at some point but if I waited they might not have the keyboard (for a MacPro] and I would be bumped out of line.  I asked them how a car dealership could operate in such a fashion with people not being able to do without a car for two weeks and not stocking parts.  They told me there were space limitations but how much space does a keyboard top take!  In a car garage a loaner car would be offered.  If that were the case at Apple one might get hooked on substitution of an iPad.  However, obviously Apple expects you to buy another product as they would be the first to say that we could not conduct our lives for two weeks without a computer.  I was in fact thinking of an iPad as my laptop is relatively heavy but now I do not plan to purchase another Apple product.  The lady beside me at the Genius Bar was very frustrated as she uses Apple to conduct her own business and said that service has deteriorated terribly in the past two years.",CA

I did the typical troubleshooting steps, and it took me 11 (that's eleven) calls to finally speak with someone who would do more than ask me to turn my phone off and on.

I called and demanded to speak to a senior advisor which authorized a phone exchange.

I reset my phone yet again, and the very next day the phone resets itself and only shows an apple screen, followed by a blank screen, followed by a blue screen of death, followed by another blank screen. This went on for 30 minutes before the phone became usable again. This is when I call again, and demand to speak a supervisor. I tell them I demand an upgrade on my phone since I have been receiving poor service for 6 months. Artemis the senior advisor tells me he is the ultimate authority in Apple (I kid you not, I asked if he has the same authority as the CEO of the entire company and he tells me yes I do). After demanding to speak to customer relations he transfers me to another low rankin tech person, who connects me to his senior advisor Michael Perry. I sit on hold for 45 minutes waiting to speak with customer relations and at 11:30 PM I tell him I would like to try again tomorrow. He calls me at 6:30 like requested, and attempts to connect me to customer relations. I kid you not it has been 2 hours and 28 minutes on hold. Apple has given me easily the worst experience of my entire 22 year life, and they seem to think it is a joke. I will share this with every friend I have and request you do the same until I get someone to answer my call.   After speaking with Anna Whittemore, I've learned that like Artemis, she is the living incarnate of Apple. Anyone higher than her can't be bothered by us simple regular folk, so they have bestowed upon her the power of the almighty Apple. I should feel fortunate to have only waited 3 hours and 15 minutes to speak to such a deity. She offered me a printer for my trouble.",US

At Three,when the worker found the core of the problem, they were kind enough to at least provide me with the phone to call Apple tech team.thanks guys. So I was put trough to a senior Apple tech advisor after a junior one wasnt getting what is happening, who told me to send proof of a purchase, what luckily I did have(even though I bough a devise 3 YEARS ago) and promised that the problem is going to resolve within 3 working days and they will contact me directly. So it is the end of 4th day and I still havent heard back from anyone, and the hackers can access all my personal stuff!! what I have learnt about Apple, is that you guys care just about the sales, not customers.

I wanted to buy an IPAD for my dear sister in law as a special present for a special birthday. I ordered it the week before from Apple site because I wanted it engraved. I explained to Sales that we were going away and didn't want it delivered until the following Wednesday. They said that they would make sure it wasn't and to ignore any emails which did not acknowledge this as all emails were automated and couldn't be changed (eh, this from an IT Company - should have rung warning bells). The delivery instructions were not followed through. On our return on the Tuesday, I found that UK Mail had tried to deliver it twice so I went online and arranged for delivery on Thursday (figured to late to ask for Wednesday). Received an email confirming delivery on Thursday. On that day telephoned Apple to ask them to confirm it. They refused to do anything and said it was my responsibility to contact UK Mail !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Telephoned UK Mail and was told goods had been delivered and signed for by Borat. I told them they definitely had not and they then said that they would investigate and call me back. After two hours I called them back and spoke to someone else who said this time that they had been returned to the Apple Depot and gave me a local number to call. Telephone number turned out to be unobtainable. Called Apple again and spoke to a Jonathan in Belfast who said he would organise for the IPad to be delivered on Saturday. We were going away to Kent for the birthday party, but my son, who was planning to visit a friend in Essex before joining us on the Sunday for the party, said he would stay and wait. Late afternoon on the Friday though I received an email saying I was to expect delivery that say. Needless to say that the IPad was not delivered either day. So I had a day off work and lost a day's pay  and my son wasted a day - surely a compensation payment would be due if I took it to court. To avoid disappoint to my sister in law I went and purchased one from Currys on the Sunday and cancelled the order with Apple. More money because I had to ring from my mobile. Let's see how long it takes to recover the money they have taken on my credit card. Rubbish service, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish. And to add insult to injury, Apple telephoned me from Luxembourg? (the man had a French accent) and intimated that if I ordered something else from Apple now they might be able to give me something to compensate for all of this trouble. When I enquired what that might be he said an IPAD cover. HA ........  And this saga is still going on, because despite our cancelling the order, the IPad was delivered this morning on the Monday before we returned home. I have had to contact Apple once again to arrange collection.  I wait to see how long it will take for this to happen and for my account to be refunded.  Watch this space.",GB

When I decided to return to school I was so out -of-touch with the tech world so I decided to purchase a 13"" Macbook Pro the first year and an iPad the second. I had been an iPhone enthusiast for some years. In November, after downloading the new Yosemite operating system, my Macbook would only reboot about a third of the way. Since I had purchased AppleCare, I called for help (waited 50 mins to speak to the person that could help at all) I was directed to a Senior Associate who was very helpful. These were the steps: (1) put in a order for an engineer to recommend a solution and his answer would take 4 days (2) then the Associate called and informed me on what to do and the computer had to set for the rest of the day to finish the first process (3) next day- more steps (4) purchased a 100.00 external hard drive--finally a working computer after 7-8 days. If you have ever been in nursing school without a computer, it sucks! Last week, like a fool, downloaded an update.......same freaking thing happened! Computer would only boot 1/3 way up....called Apple Care-waited 3 days for the engineer's response...asking me to do the very same thing over again, I said NO. I've been at the Apple Sore in Green Hills Mall since 5:30 and I have learned a few things about Apple as a whole, AppleCare, and what Apple seems to be concerned about and what they see as your issue or responsibility. I was told by their associates: 1. Associate: You are gonna have to take your Macbook over to MacAuthority or somewhere and have your data backed up (which you will have to pay for) and then bring it back here after that and we will clear your computer and reinstall our software. Me: Could I possibly loose some of my data? for instance, I probably have 3-4000$ worth of Nursing Textbooks and several research papers just to name a few things. Associate: We don't deal with your data, that will be your responsibility--Apple is only responsible for putting our software back on there. Me: (in my ignorance) So if iCloud doesn't back up my data what is it for? Associate: its only our responsibility to make sure the software is on there and your responsible for your data. In conclusion, I wanted to post this article to let those of you that are considering an Apple product to realize a few facts: 1. if you download a new operating system or an update by Apple and it screws up your computer-[to my surprise]-all Apple can offer you is to clear your computer, reinstate their software (after you have paid to have your data backed-up) and your left with possible loss of data that they don't deal with. 2. AppleCare only covers the hardware of the computer and allows you to call and get help if you don't understand something- {I know Apple is having major software issues, because I previously have called in the past and spoken to someone in about 5-10 mins max--now when you call its 45-60 mins to get to a human}--I should have taken the customer service guy's advice that told me that if it was him he wouldn't download the Yosemite until all the bugs were worked out of it. 3. Just because Apple was once an awesome company does not mean they are concerned about the same things that are important to you--just go online and try to find a number that you can talk to someone in their complaint department....let me know if you find such a number. Also, don't think that Apple will make sure you always have a working computer whether you have AppleCare or not. They are not going to give you a device to work on until yours is repaired, there is a very good chanced that your are going to be without a computer from time to time-especially when they put out a new operating system or suggest an update. --I really hope that we haven't seen the best of Apple's days--I love the way Apple's founder thought, and how he made such an effort to design programs that would make the device make sense to the user---I struggle to think that Apple has seen it's best days.",US

If you want to read the most utterly pointless response from a customer service have a look below. I'm going to go into an Apple store, take something worth ¬£120, then refuse to pay because I don't have the means to process the payment.   Hi Stephen,   [Name] here, from iTunes Store Support.   I‚Äôve been able to review your case in-depth, and I can confirm that the other advisors you‚Äôve spoken with are correct, we will not be able to offer a refund for these charges. That being the case, I would like to address your questions directly.   The main reason we are not able to issue a refund is due to the date that the charges were made. Although the iTunes Store Terms and Conditions state that all sales are final, if we are notified of a billing issue within 90 days of the purchase or auto-renewal occurring we typically are able to make an exception and provide a refund. Past 90 days, our ability to issue refunds becomes very limited, and under these circumstances we are not able to offer a refund outside of this 90 day window. For reference, you can review the iTunes Store Terms and Conditions here:   You also asked me to clarify why we did not prevent the duplicate billing from occurring, given that the subscription is the same whether you subscribe with publisher directly or through us. The duplicate billing was allowed to occur as there is not a system or process in place that confirms whether or not you are already subscribing through the publisher.    I will certainly be submitting your feedback through my internal channels. I will be requesting the addition of features that prevent duplicate billing from occurring under these circumstances and changes to our procedures that allow for exceptions to be made under these circumstances outside of our normal 90 day refund window. I encourage you to submit feedback as well so that it‚Äôs seen twice.   I regret that we were not able to assist further on this case, but please don‚Äôt hesitate to let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.    Best regards, Ô£ø [Name] iTunes Senior Advisor",GB

When I returned they said that they had found a wire missing inside the phone, and concluded that someone had tampered with the phone. I referred to the reseller and explained it was a brand new phone wrapped in the normal packaging. But, they still denied. After consulting with the reseller I mailed the phone for repair. The repair was done with no further discussion, and we have a working phone again. But, I wasted half a day on Apple's arroganza. One star ... maybe they will eventually improve the customer service.   EXPERIENCE 2 I eventually got a replacement unit cf. above. After three months the head phone jack didnt work anymore. I tried several times to book a genius time slot in Regents Street. But, when I had picked an available time and entered my personal info ... the website tells med the slot is gone. It did so 5 times in a row. Then I went a week forward to a day where there were plenty of open slots. Same same. Very efficent customer service denial function. The solution is to go to a non Apple repair shop. And you know what ... then all warranty is over. I must do another try with Android ... this arrogance must be punished.",GB

Once you get used to the little differences between PC's and Mac's, you will definitely prefer the mac. I can't say enough good things about it.  I also recently got an iPhone 4S.  Another life-changing purchase...life is much simpler, more organized, and entertaining.

Obviously the products are simply amazing, from iPhones to computers and although seemingly expensive in the long term I think they work out far far cheaper than PCs.   All my macs are still running perfectly, even my first G4, and don't get me wrong I've had the occasional problem with a laptop lead failing, or faulty drive etc, but I've had far less downtime and hassle running my Macs in 10 years, than the hell I used to go through with PCs.     Testament to this is how many of my friends and family have now moved over to Apple, probably helped a little by me.   Whether you're shopping online or in one of their stores the experience is nothing but exceptional.  They have the best customer service in the business, whatever your question no matter how big or small it may be they just want to help you.  Go into a store and they'll greet you, and then let you be until you want help.  There is absolutely no sales pressure, they are simply there to help and answer your questions.  In fact if you just want to go in and check your emails or facebook then that is no problem either as I did many a time when i went to the US.    Can't fault Apple in any which way, Steve Jobs has built the best products and software, and it was certainly a sad day to wave goodbye to him last year.

The only technology company outsourcing to China that is creating some level of transparency and setting standards higher than the people in China are accustomed to, and certainly higher than their competition, no matter what the headlines try to say in order to get your attention.  They may be a little late to getting their products environmentally responsible, but again, true top Apple, they pushed the standards high and have achieved amazing results!

I really do. I even considered getting a Mac Book to replace my aging PC. But I can't bring myself to overlook the crappy customer service I have received from Apple.   Case in point - I had a first generation IPod. I received an email that there was a defect in the battery and that Apple was replacing all first generation IPods. I found my IPod and contacted Apple. They said that they were sending me a box and I simply ship it back to Apple and I'd get a replacement within a few weeks.    During that time, I had a few additional questions. Contacting Apple via phone was a nightmare and I spent a long time trying to get the right person. When I finally did get someone, they said that I had been included in the replacement program in error and that I should toss out the replacement box and NOT send my IPod in.   WTF?!?   I had wasted time and energy on this mess and all they could say was that this was a mistake on Apple's part?!? They were apologetic, but they were somewhat snarky about the whole matter. They agreed to allow me to talk to a manager for further explanation. Then they put me on hold. At the five minute on hold mark, I said, ""you know, life is short. I've wasted enough of my life on this mess"" and hung up.   I tossed out the box. Despite the glowing customer service my friends have gotten from Apple, I don't really have much good to say about my experiences with them.

I called the apple tech support where they charge $30 to help make sure its not a simple problem.  I hesitantly obliged knowing it wasnt a simple issue and figuring I wouldnt be charged when they found this to be true. Tech support has you hold down a couple buttons at the same time (which I already tried 20+ times myself.) This did not remedy the issue and I was told I would have to apply for a refund of the $30 since it was a problem w/ their product. I told her I didnt want to apply for a refund, I just wanted her to cancel the transaction then and there. She said she would, and yet the charge is still on my statement.  I wish this is where my complaint ends but it's far from over. The technician told me there were a few ways to replace the phone, most cost more money and time without a phone. I chose to go into a apple store so they could replace it for me free of charge. Of course they set an appt. for you not knowing if the store even has the product on hand. I asked if she could find out ahead of time to save me time and gas. She told me she could not dial out from her office and that I would have to call on my own. After spending $30 for absolutely zero help, this really pissed me off. So I took a deep breath and hung up w/ her and called the store. After a 15 minute wait on hold a representitve answered only to tell me they can't look up what products they have in stock and I'd just have to come in and hope it worked out. If they didnt, they could send me to another store or order one for me. This is the MOST rediculous thing I have ever heard!

5568,www.apple.com,2011-11-16T13:14:13.000Z,1,Nice hardware but very frustrating registration process,"I recently became an Apple user by buying an IMac and upgrading to an IPad and IPhone combo from Best Buy/Car Phone Warehouse.  All seemed well until I had to register my products and upgrade the operating system on the IMac because the mail app wouldn't work with the email address they had given me as it wasn't ICloud friendly.   First the Apple on-line software wouldn't recognise my IMAC or IPAD serial numbers and all the staff could say was it was it was a known problem so I was told I would need to upload my receipt, then the system would not accept either a scan or photo of the receipt and there was no other way of going forward which was most annoying.  After a number of time consuming back and forth conversations with Apple care staff and many frustrated attempts to register on my part I had to take the computer back to the store so they could try to resolve the problems.  They didn't have any more success than me so in the end they had to take my new IMAC back, transfer all of my data across to another new system and give me the new Imac. I am a small business user and I found it to be a very frustrating experience that cost me a week I could ill afford, add to that the fact that Apple seem to think you don't need manuals for any of their equipment so you have to work everything out for yourself and the mail app doest actually retrieve emails but only downloads copies so you need a means of clearing your mailboxes on-line and there would appear to be no Apple applications like Mail washer to do that its been a very frustrating experience and one I am beginning to regret so all in all I am not at all impressed. Its a shame as the Ipad and the Iphone are really nice but this experience has really soured things for me Apple needs to do something about that if that want more people to come over from Windows.  In the meantime I am left still using my old Windows laptop to do mailbox house keeping, manage my email accounts and create patterns in CoralDraw as it looks like the Mac just isnt up to taking either job in a cost effective and efficient manner what a shame",GB
