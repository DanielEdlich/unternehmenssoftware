Finally was sent a PDF file which I forwarded to my daughter's phone and she was able to print it at the post office and get it scanned.  It took us each three trips to the post office and a lot of lost time waiting for mail.  My daughter cannot be the only person who does not have access to a printer.

So it went something like this all three sold days apart the last pair probably 7 days after the first so I was happy enough but still no money coming in .. MONEY ON HOLD couldn’t really understand why as all buyers had sent messages through eBay telling me how happy they were and left feedback . I must say that I went to the post office as soon as I was paid and sent insurance paid signed for next day at 11.50 per pair (unfortunately I didn’t use eBay post label of which I’m sure they get a commission)  Anyway I’m going off track. I eventually managed after 2 days to work out how to speak with them .. Firstly I couldn’t work out why they were offering me so little money back . The total sales were 640.00 I was told that they take 10.66 pct for selling and I had pressed something else that cost 99p so basically total of 69.82 cost and yes I pressed another button of which they said was a common mistake for people that are not used to selling and they would refund it . All well and good but where is my money so again transferred me to someone else I think in the US so after she’d managed successfully to wind me up with company small print and complete false niceness. I was then put on to a manager in Dublin so I have been around the world asking why I was on hold . The long and short of it is that because I’m new the hold onto my money. The Irishman even threatened it could take one month  Customer service I don’t think so just another case of large organisations holding on to peoples money and getting interest…. Anyway they haven’t refunded as they said the 20 odd pound into my account as they are offering 555.20 for 640.00 pounds of sales however they said they would only deduct 69.82 and yes they still have my money all of it . The decision that Daniel from Dublin made was they would pay 2 weeks after every sale let’s see what they take money wise . I suggest to all students young people actually anybody thinking about selling through this American company that avoids paying tax in the U.K. and holds your money use another platform a kind caring one try vinted . The lack of humanity from the dinosaurs has to stop . I don’t get paid to talk to them or chase my money . I’m sure they will further let me down by breaking their word and charging the other 20 odd pounds that they said would be put back on my account. I WILL OF COURSE LET EVERYONE KNOW WHEN I EVENTUALLY GET PAID OR IF ..,GB

When eBay stepped in to help the matter, the seller sends very curt responses accusing me of basically stealing the item and stating I should have knocked on neighbors doors [an apartment complex] to find it.  The business office is located on the property and items delivered are logged and notices sent to come and pick it up, that's what happens five days a week...it would be impossible for a package to be left 'at the front desk' on a Sunday plus each building has a security door and how would a person knock on another person's door and expect them to hand over a package that they might have taken by mistake from the mailroom?  Before the transaction closed without a refund due to inactivity, marcosellsalot said it would give a refund and not to ever order from marcosellsalot again.  One more accusation I made during this drama was a nebulous tracking number giving proof that the package was delivered and received on 11/13/22; so much for free shipping and luckily only losing $19.99.",US

But as a buyer there is no way to know if you were taken advantage of or not.  After I waited for the item I sent the seller a note to say the item did not arrive and got no response.  And of course I disputed the charge on my credit card.  A couple days later the item arrived.  I contacted the buyer and let him know what happened and offered to make the payment directly.  I had no way to know the item would arrive late.  In the past items that did not arrive on time did not arrive and I had to wait for refunds and disputes and all that.

193,www.ebay.com,2022-12-22T20:24:14.000Z,1,Ebay is not a safe marketplace anymore,"Ebay took my money and merchandise because it has arrived later than their given delivery timeframe. I sell watches there regularly, and im a member over 15 years. The late delivery happened because of UK postal strikes, and there was nothing I could do to speed up delivery and customs clearance to Kazakhstan and they did not care that the item eventually got delivered, because it was out of their suggested delivery time. The tracking clearly shows that it has got delivered, and apparently my ONLY option left is to contact the buyer, who has obviously no intention or obligation (by ebay) to pay for something he clearly received for free (instead of £250). Again, there is nothing anyone can do to speed up international delivery and customs clearance after a package is on its way. Im sure im not alone with this problem and ebay does not give you any credit even after thousands of good feedbacks, 100% profile, subscription fee and high selling fees to pay. It clearly states on their site that strikes may slow down delivery, but their policy still unchanged, and if your tracking doesn't update for 10-15 days, they just consider it as lost, even though these are busy times and it is international delivery to a developing country. Also, if you've posted the item, its on its way to its destination, but the buyer  -as in my case- decides that the package must arrive within his never before mentioned timeframe, you still can't do anything to speed up delivery, and if he decides not to accept the package, that will be blamed on the seller. I am chasing my money for weeks now, and spent hours emailing and phoning them, and at this point it looks like im going to lose my case, because the only other option they recommended is to complain the postal service (Royal Mail) that their service is unsatisfactory... but the outcome is obvious. The tracking shows it's delivered, so they did their job. Utterly ridiculous from Ebay, and this should not be legal this way, when you clearly did your best, you have proof of delivery, someone has your money and your merchandise, and you even paid for this to happen.",GB

198,www.ebay.com,2022-12-29T03:19:17.000Z,2,FRAUDULENT & DAMAGED GOODS,"I've been an Ebay customer since June 2021. Since then, I've enjoyed using this Internet middleman. Unfortunately, today, (12-28-2022) changed that.  On 12-20-2022, I purchased a set of 1pc racing leathers from a British seller known as Gingzalog. For the first two weeks prior to my purchasing these leathers all went well. He responded twice and even sometimes thrice times a day. He shipped these out and they arrived a month early! Naturally, I was thrilled by this. They were advertised as 'vintage' and after reviewing the pictures carefully, I was convinced they were in very decent shape.  Unfortunately, Ebay doesn't provide the sense of 'smell' via the Internet and upon opening my package, the awful odor of mildew & mold hit me like a ton of bricks. Being an asthmatic & unfortunately, overly-sensitive to odors, I immediately had to take these to my garage. I also folded them up and placed them in my pickup truck bed and hauled them five miles to a professional leather cleaner who informed me it would cost me around $145 to have them treated. They said because the odor was so intense, they would treat the leather twice over but, couldn't guarantee me complete removal. I was also informed that the interior was shredding from being sweated in and not properly hanged to dry completely. He told me ""whoever owned these prior to me did a very poor job of caring for them and he was surprised the leather hadn't cracked yet"".  I believed there was still some ability to salvage these racing leathers and I also couldn't return them as the cost would be astronomical as I paid $66. I also thought that the seller should reimburse me something since these were technically ""damaged"" goods. He falsely advertised them as being in good shape and ready-to-wear. I reached out to the seller 'Gingzalog', from (Great Britain) and politely, but firmly told him my dilemma and told him that I wanted to keep the leathers but wanted him to refund me at least the cost of my shipping so I could use that towards the cleaning. He didn't understand why I couldn't clean them myself. I informed him that he must have kept these racing leathers in some storage that was damp, like a (shed, garage, basement, or other location) where some type of moisture had attacked them. He also denied them having any odor at all. I informed him that they completely lost their natural leather smell (the leather smell ensures that they have been care for properly and are treated in maintenance well), but these were covered in mildew & mold was growing in certain exterior & interior spots.  I contacted him three time over the next day and asked if he was going to be professional about this & aid me in repairing the damage. Of course, like a typical immature and unprofessional Internet vendor, he cut-and-ran with my money. He ceased communicating with me. And I am aware of the six-hour time difference (which I carefully planned so that he would receive my messages when he woke in the morning), but he failed to acknowledge these.  Ebay won't assist buyers in circumstances like these as the seller, after my reaching out to him again, removed all of his Ebay store merchandise, and strangely, and suddenly added on the page I bought the leathers from 'No Refunds Accepted', even though he initially accepted 30-day returns.  He knows he was in the wrong. He knows he has been caught and it appears he doesn't care to assist a customer in resolving their issue with his online store. Instead, he took my money, and ran off with it. No morals, no ethics. A common tale in today's society.  The only reason I gave this seller a chance was that the (2-pages of recent reviews seemed very promising), and therefore, I gave him a shot. I should have taken the hint from the other buyers.  I can only hope that this seller eventually gets discovered for fraudulent and misleading advertising and is kicked from Ebay permanently. WARNING: (do not purchase used or motorcycle / sportbike racing leathers, gear, or racing boots/MX boots), or other clothing from Ebay. Unless you can physically hold and inspect the item/s, you are taking a chance. You are taking the word of a stranger. I would like to say that people who are claiming to be merchants on Ebay should be trusted, but this is total bunk. Sadly, there are too many even there who fancy taking advantage of people there. Maybe one day, Ebay will actually make good on intervening into actual problems and keeping buyers happy, where us disgruntled folk won't have to come here and voice out hatreds towards them.",US
199,www.ebay.com,2022-12-07T08:00:48.000Z,1,Account permanently suspended without a reason and right to appeal. Never sold or bought anything,"1. Requested to delete an old account (never sold or bought items) 2. Created a new account, as the rules allow it.  3. New account was suspended almost instantly. Notification letter says I should check page about suspension info to find out how to appeal for unblock. Checked the link they provided - ""your suspension letter will tell how to remove suspension bla bla"" . I.e. letter sends me to read guideline and the guideline bounces back to the letter. this is a literal mockery. 4. Tried using chat and contact Support - several times got refused without explaining why. Finally contacted an alive person (at least supposed to be).  5. Employee said my account is blocked forever and I can't appeal against it. Why? Because they ""have some records"" of something. I violated something, but do not tell what exactly. Fresh account, lived for maybe an hour and it is already suspended forever. No warning or reference to what I did wrong. Employee, who said about my suspension, copy-pasted a text and then rushed to leave a chat. Rude and disgusting behavior, where the Support do not help at all and only offend a user without a good reason.  6. Contacted another employee and asked whether I can keep my old account (I asked to delete before) - he said no. Although rules says I can cancel erasing process before it is finished. Okay, nevermind.  7. Asked whether I can register a new account on eBay or it will be suspended as well - he said it will be suspended. Why and for what reason? Do not know, because he also left the chat and I couldn't ask.  8. Okay, let's make 10 tries again before their chat finally opens and I can contact a Support. Asked an assistant how can I make a purchase - whether  I should create a new account or use an old one. He said ""can make a new"", but I should ""wait several days"". ""Do I need to wait until the first account is deleted?"" - I wondered. And the Support assistant changed his mind and suddenly said that I should better wait 30 days. Why? Just because. Where is it written in rules? Will my other accounts be suspended because one already was - he doesn't now at all. 9. It appeared that my first account somehow got ""restrictions"". But they also do not say what kind of, and why.  10. Only one competent assistant (the fourth) helped me to delete new account, because eBay also restricted it deleting for an unknown reason.  To summarize: suspension policy is discriminative and disgusting. eBay doesn't bother to tell your violation or what makes them fell suspicious about your account. I didn't cause any harm, but I was instantly and permanently blocked without a right for appealing. The assistants do not know anything about their own suspension policy and provide mutually-exclusive explanations. My current status (as an eBay user) is not clear at all - can I use it for purchases or no? Will I be suspended if I create a new account? Overall, their attitude is discriminative and ignorant.",TW

A customer cannot talk to a real person.Their 1800 number goes through to a recorded voice that directs the consumer to it's help page and then the call ends. Want help from a bot or a text chat? Forget it. Hopeless.  Also, they do nothing about sellers who advertise goods that, upon receipt of the goods, are 'not as advertised'. I bought an iPhone se2020 from the seller oz_wonderland. It was advertised as 'brand new'. As the heat-packaging looked suspect and some printing inside the box, I checked the status of the phone with Apple. It was refurbished phone and hence no Apple warranty as it had been activated by a prior purchaser. The seller says it is an Australian seller but it ships phones from Malaysia via a global distribution warehouse with a base in Victoria. Thank God I paid by Paypal. As the goods are 'not as described', The seller according to eBay terms and conditions, is responsible for the return postage. Oh, no. they are not! I am told as I am dealing now with PayPal (who by the way, will only refund the purchase price), the seller does not have to do so.  To add insult to injury, the text chat person sends me an email of the chat transcript and says that they hope they have resolved the matter. Well, no! As far as I am concerned they did not. oz_wonderland is rated as a top seller on eBay; perhaps because they do sell items other than these iPhones, and also, I suspect, because most buyers don't check the serial number on the box with Apple customer support.  I have come to realise that, as a buyer, one needs to pay more attention to the less numerous negative reviews. After the event, when I did, I read almost word-for-word other buyers' comments on these refurbished phones being sold as 'brand new'.",AU

That is really the only checking account that I use. I do have a cashapp, and it apparently supports CashApp but not chime?! Really?! Well, I went ahead and connected my cashapp account to receive payouts. Suddenly, a restriction is placed on my account that puts a hold on my payments. They ask for a statement, so I send them a statement. I wait two days, log in, they're asking for a statement again. I wait another few days, account is still restricted and they're asking for a statement again. And this whole time I've never even received communication from Ebay as to why they're not accepting the statement. I talk to the agent and they tell me the statement doesn't have transactions on it, but since I don't use cashapp as a bank, it doesn't have many transactions on the account. I only had an older statement from earlier this year that has a few transactions on it. So I sent that. We'll see, I guess. This is just ridiculous. I used to sell on ebay a couple of years ago, and it was on the same account. But I stopped selling on there for quite a while. It used to not be like this. Now it's complicated and sooo tedious. I haven't even posted any listings because why bother?! I'm clearly not going to be able to recieve payouts because of their silly rules. What I find funny, or should I say extremely irritating, is that Ebay makes it super easy to input a debit card for them to take THEIR money FROM us, but when it comes to inputting a method to receive OUR money, it has to be super complicated. Like, they have no problem accepting my chime debit card for paying fees and purchases so that Ebay can get paid, but they can't accept my Chime bank account so that I can get paid. What a joke! I've run into other headaches so far as well, I just don't want to waste anymore of my time explaining them.

During that time I have had two problems with purchases that were reported to eBay/PayPal.  One included an item the genuine manufacturer declared to be a fake. The latest is regarding an incorrectly supplied and returned item which, at this moment, has left me £58 out of pocket.   On the fake item eBay closed the case because they were unable to contact the seller.  Goodbye £30. The second concerned an item where the seller supplied an incorrect item and collected it back for refund.  After nearly 4 weeks and numerous messages to the seller through the messaging system (no responses) no refund has been received.  I put in a claim through the PayPal buyer protection scheme.  Now they have closed that case too saying it is not covered under their protection scheme!  Good bye another £58. Buyer Beware.  Not all rogues are sellers.",GB

295,www.ebay.com,2022-11-16T21:35:12.000Z,1,eBay Wrongly Removes Negative Feedback AGAIN,"I have not sold anything on eBay in eons, but I still buy on eBay.  Most of my transactions work out fine. If there is a problem, good sellers will do whatever has to be done to make it right, e.g. returning the item for a refund.   However, there are some bad sellers who flat out refuse to take care of things, and on the relatively rare occasion I run across one of these sellers, I leave the appropriate feedback, i.e. either a neutral or a negative feedback.  What bothers me is that some of these sellers somehow manage to get their negative feedbacks removed thus distorting a clear and honest picture of how satisfied buyers have been been with these sellers. It happed to me again very recently.  I left an honest negative feedback about seller vintage_finds_rescue_dogs in Marietta, GA, a woman named Shannon.  I purchased an item from this seller for nearly $300.  Seller shipped the item via UPS.  UPS is one of the worst carriers out there in my opinion, but that is who she chose.   Well, on delivery day, UPS could not be bothered to come into my courtyard to leave my package on my porch.  The driver could not even be bothered to put the package inside the fence out of sight of passersby.  Driver left the package in the front yard unbeknownst to me, and someone swiped the package.  I was very angry with UPS and filed another complaint against them with the BBB.  As always, they did nothing except to offer a worthless ""We're sorry"" reply.   I also reported everything to seller who first said there was nothing she could do about it.  I told her she needed to follow up with UPS because I wanted my money back.  She told me she filed on the insurance, and she would get back to me in about 8 days because that was how long it would take UPS to process the paperwork.  Well, 8 days passed, then 2 weeks, then 3 weeks, and finally 4 weeks.  I still did not hear back from seller.  So, I contacted her again, but there was no reply.  Ultimately, my credit card company filed the dispute which was eventually decided in my favour, which was good and correct, but today I noticed that the seller somehow got eBay to remove my honest, clean feedback which was not in violation of any eBay policy on feedback. As I said, this is not the first time sellers have gotten feedback removed without good cause.  I am angry.  I contacted eBay and spoke to the usual worthless customer service people somewhere in the Philippines.  The woman said she could not restore the feedback, so I asked to speak to a supervisor.  I have now been on hold for one hour waiting to speak to a supervisor.  This is outrageous.   Feedback is only useful if negative feedback is allowed to stand.  If buyers never know about other buyers's negative experiences, if all they can ever see is positive feedbacks, the what good is feedback?  Feedback must encompass good, neutral, and negative reviews.  I blame the sellers who whine to eBay about their negative feedback in order to get it removed, but I blame eBay even more for removing negative feedbacks that are in no way in violation of eBay policy.   Ultimately, a seller may not be good, but eBay is worse for removing seller's negative feedback.  They have been doing this that I know of for well over ten years.  Someone needs to do something to eBay to put a stop to this, and sellers like Shannon (eBay user I.D. vintage_finds_rescue_dogs) need to stand up and take responsibility for their sales. If you earned negative feedback, then that is your fault, not the buyers.",US

Even if you say ""no refunds"", eBay will require you to give a refund. Their favorite line I have seen is that there is no telling how the item was shipped out. A Limited Edition item was opened by the buyer who claimed it was defective because of ""severe"" paint damage. The image sent didn't back the claim but eBay does not care. eBay's concern is that they don't want the buyer to go to their bank and claim they didn't do the transaction. It is better to have the seller bite the bullet than them. Does not matter that the item cannot be resold. Does not matter that the seller had the item for a while. What matters is that they don't want to lose funds. They say they protect the seller by having them offer the refund and then they can open a claim that the seller lied. Again, remember eBay said they don't know how the item was shipped. It won't end in your favor. Best thing to do is not sell things that are collectors on eBay or be very picky with who you sell to. eBay does not care if the seller has high ratings and the buyer has close to none. What matters to them is ensuring they keep money in their pockets. So do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. Sell items on your own, like Facebook Market or anything but eBay.",US

Just normal household items when the kids get something they don't need or we want to make some extra cash parting with our collections. Started up again last month after being away for a while.  I knew there were a lot of changes to their process. I thought, no big deal, and I followed their instructions.  But they seem to cater to sellers with higher ratings now to the point where my stuff is barely seen. I get hardly any views on normal items.  I followed all of the tips for getting more views, free shipping, guaranteed delivery, international sales using their global shipping facility.  Still no changes.  I even tried to boost your sale feature that you have to pay for.  It really didn't affect my views at all.  It's a shame because the buyers in Ebay were really great. Had a couple bad apples over the last 12 years but normally, everyone was cool.  I will be looking at other platforms that dont cater to people who own stores.  Ebay was always meant to be an online marketplace for people to sell stuff from home to others looking for that item.  Really sad what it's become.",US

They have recently provided me with very courteous, timely, and effective customer services. At this time, I am very pleased with their customer services. I am only unhappy with their seller Surplus-Bargains' very poor customer services which have caused me a lot of stress and frustration. Please read all my reviews below to understand my situation with ebay.com and their seller Surplus-Bargains.  ++UPDATED ON 11/12/22: For order #25-09106-78092, I asked the seller to return 2 eyeglasses frames that were seriously defective. I ordered 5 frames in this order. Again, the seller was unresponsive to my request. I contacted ebay.com's customer services a few times about this matter and one customer services representative gave me a full refund for this order. I am very happy with her decision.  ++Therefore, I am changing my rating from 3 stars to 4 stars.  ++I couldn't give ebay.com a 5 stars due to some unsatisfactory experience with ebay.com's customer services at the beginning and the very negative experience with their seller Surplus-Bargains who cancelled one of my orders without my permission and who has blocked me from ordering more eyeglass frames from her product page without a valid reason.   ++UPDATED ON 11/11/22: For the order #09-09262-21553, I was not satisfied with all the 3 frames I ordered because they were very defective. Therefore, I requested a return from Surplus-Bargains. This seller didn't respond to my request. Instead, she asked the ebay.com's customer service department to help me with this request. Within 24 hours, the ebay.com's customer services department informed me that they had refunded to my account the full payment of 3 frames due to my dissatisfaction of these products. I didn't have to return these defective products to them. I am pleased with this accommodation from the ebay.com's customer service department. Therefore, I am changing the rating of my recent experience with this company from 1 star to 3 stars.  ++However, I am keeping my rating of Surplus-Bargains at 1 star because Alexa, the owner of this store has been completely unresponsive to all my emails after she cancelled my order of 4 frames without my permission. In addition, she has removed both my negative feedbacks for 2 orders from her ebay page. In addition, she has listed that she has sold 12 frames when in fact she cancelled my 4 frames order. She should have listed that she has sold only 8 frames. I am the only customer who has purchased these frames (1 style).  ++ORIGINAL STORY: I ordered 3 eyeglasses frames with surplus-bargains at ebay.com (Order#09-09262-21553). After I ordered those 3 frames (same style), I ordered 4 more frames to have a larger selection to select the best 5 frames to keep. The seller (Alexa) cancelled my second order without my permission. When I sent her some emails to express my concerns on her unprofessional behavior, she ignored all my emails! When I tried to re-order 4 more frames, she ""blocked"" me from ordering these frames for no valid reason. I called and sent messages to ebay.com's customer services 3 or 4 times to express my concerns about this seller and asked them to ask this seller to unblock me. However, no ebay.com's customer services representatives could help me resolve this problem. One customer services representative told me ebay.com's customer services couldn't contact the seller and only the seller could contact the ebay.com's customer services which didn't make sense to me. I sent an email to an ebay.com's customer service representative and Alexa (to both of them together) but neither of them responded to my email. I requested a supervisor to call me twice but no one has called me. Ebay.com's extremely poor customer services have proven that they are helpless and don't care about their customers. They work with and allow disrespectful, rude, mean, and unprofessional sellers like Alexa (surplus-bargains) to treat me horribly and discriminate against me without any valid reasons. This is my second time ordering on ebay.com and it is the worst experience I have ever had with online customer services and sellers. I feel humiliated, insulted and disrespected by Alexa from surplus-bargains. I feel disrespected and ignored by ebay.com's customer services. I feel they are helpless, ineffective, and inefficient.",US

351,www.ebay.com,2022-11-05T00:08:56.000Z,1,DONT SELL THROUGH EBAY,"I seriously don’t understand why eBay doesn’t do better considering they have TERRIBLE reviews on their customer service and their policies but, I digress. I sold an item on eBay for $160. Of course they take out a ridiculous amount of selling fees AND made me pay for shipping of the item even though the buyer is supposed to pay AND I had used a shipping label created by eBay. Red flag #1. The item is delivered to the buyer, mind you I had taken pictures of the item prior to the purchase because I know there are scammers out there. And of course, the buyer says the item is damaged and they want a refund. They sent me pictures of the item which clearly had new scratches and marks on it that were NOT present when I had shipped it. I had also packaged it well so that wasn’t an issue either. My account says NO REFUNDS for a REASON. But as we all know, eBay doesn’t back their sellers whatsoever. So they end up issuing a refund to the buyer who is 100% a scammer. They refunded them and then went after me for what I “owed them”. They wanted me to pay them $170+, what I SHOULD'VE gotten for the transaction but they had taken fees out and charged me shipping. Absolutely absurd. I only ended up receiving $140 for the item in the first place, but they want to come after me for the full price of the item, shipping, AND feed that they ALREADY TOOK. Red flag #2. And red flag #3; never received the item back. I filed multiple claims on the buyers, I filed a claim for the missing item. eBay did nothing. They said since the tracking number showed it delivered, there was nothing they could do. I’m absolutely baffled by this whole situation and the fact that I am not the first person they’ve done this to and I certainly won’t be the last.

Unfortunately when a buyer leaves an honest negative review for a seller, the seller makes contact and eBay remove the negative feedback even though no breach of eBay guidelines were made. No contact with buyer prior to eBay removing the feedback. Then as the buyer who left the honest feedback contacts eBay to inquire as to why the feedback was removed eBay always reply with a scripted response. Sorry it was human error that the review was removed!! Also it cannot be reinstated once the review has been removed, it has to stay off the site!! Same generic illegal response!! eBay need yo be held accountable",AU

If they want to give this social media photo op skiver her money back without my consent ( and the guy on the phone admitted THEY WILL no matter what!! Even though sges only just opened case.

Buyer’s asking to keep lowering the price. Then it doesn’t fit so it’s not as described. eBay refunded buyer who didn’t bother to return it. Then buyer ignores all messages.

I explained this to eBay and they know what she’d done but in the next breath say I have to refund the full amount. I gave it so many chances, but it’s getting worse, so bad that every other sale there’s something wrong. I’ve come to expect it but NO MORE. I’ve had it with them, I’m done! I ended all my listing and I’ve deleted my account. When I told eBay on the phone that you are freely allowing buyers to scam sellers and they’re doing as they damn well please.

I BEG ANYONE TO PLEASE USE ANOTHER PLATFORM. DO NOT TRUST THEM. THEY DON’T GIVE A DAMN! SO DO NOT SUPPORT THEM! FIND ANOTHER PLATFORM TO SELL ON! I KNEW IT WAS BAD AS I ONLY SELL PERIODICALLY BUT HE FEW WEEKS IVE RECENTLY BEEN ON THERE. I CAN TELL ITS GONE DOWN HILL! IT NOW A SITE THAT INVITES BUYERS AS WELL AS THEMSELVES TO SCAM THE SELLERS! THIS IS A WARNING TO BE AWARE! It’s exhausting trying to fight for your rights to get your own money back that’s owed to you! Phone calls, message after message after message…….STAY AWAY!",GB

We have still not seen any money however! They sent a message on Oct 18 to say that they are sending the payout and it may take 0-4 days to show up on our bank account (why would that be also remains a mystery…) but four days later still nothing coming our way… They not only purposefully delay the payout, I am sure to their own interest on top of their already fat commission, but they also think that they are dealing with morons, coming up with all kinds of excuses for to achieve this.

I contacted FedEx and they stated the tracking number showed no information matching to me and my address. This dispute was automatically dismissed by both eBay and PayPal. This is absurd and I ended up losing 600$ and got no help to get my money back. eBay has lost a valuable customer as I have been with them for quite a while and always remained genuine and trustworthy.

A third scammer claimed an item I sold that I had tested before shipping did not work, and I lost the value of the item and the cost of shipping both ways. It turns out these days, if you are a regular seller on eBay, you have basically zero protection from eBay. If you cancel an order because the buyer is a scammer, the buyer can leave negative feedback and eBay will refuse to remove it. Buyers can force you to accept returns for any reason they like even if your items state ""no returns"" and you will end up paying the shipping both ways. Buyers can send you an empty box and eBay will still side with the buyer and take your money. eBay doesn't accept photos or videos as evidence any more and will almost always side with the buyer.

Today I had to jump through hoops to ""verify my identity"" simply to make purchases. I understand the need to avoid fraud, but to ask questions completely unrelated to a shopping website is insane to me. To be asked to verify my height as it appears on my drivers license to a business who has absolutely no reason to have that information is unacceptable. I had already been on the phone for 25+ mins and had answered multiple questions and reset my password 3 times, so clearly it was me. Then when I was asked to verify certain questions I assumed it would be security questions or account related questions, like items I've sold/purchased. I was already locked out of my account, so if I was a fraudster I would have no quick/easy way of confirming that info. But if someone who knows me is trying to hack my account, they most certainly know how tall I am. So the logic for ""absolutely having to use personal, non-Ebay related info to prove your identity"" is hogwash.  I then told the rep I was not going to answer the question about my height (because it is NONE OF THEIR BUSINESS) to which she tried to tell me the info is not kept in their system, it's a program they use, blah, blah, blah. I could care less. All of these companies want our data and they will do whatever they can to get it.  I told her to close my account.  To which, guess what, she did immediately! Now, ain't that something? I thought I absolutely needed to verify my identity by answering these personal, non-Ebay related questions in order to confirm I was not accessing the account fraudulently. But apparently, that same info is not needed to close an 18 year old account entirely.  Because why do I need to verify info to make a purchase but don't need to verify the same info to close the account?  Because it is not about keeping my account safe, it's about the data.

Who and where you're calling is a call center in the Philippines.  Let's face it, this country is classified as ""third world"" and English is not the dominant language.  Perhaps now you understand why you have trouble communicating with any rep.  Further, they have very little authority to actually resolve any problems.  Ebay is located in San Jose, California.  This is where the big decisions are made-the Philippines is where you get shuffled off to.  This is what I've found that works, particularly if you live in California-Small Claims.  This is the ONLY way to get their attention.  You need to complete the easy forms for your City and name Ebay, Inc as the defendant.  Their mailing address is 2025 Hamilton Ave. San Jose, California 95125.  However, their agent for service is C T Corporation 330 N. Brand Blvd  Ste 700 Glendale, California 91203.  You need to list this agent on your small claims form in order to properly serve them.  You can't just send the court forms directly to Ebay.  Sorry Ebay, but you brought this on yourself.",US

Now I wanted to sell something and went through everything and created an advertisement, 15 minutes later: You have been banned from our website because you are a danger to our community, and the decision is irreversible. Never experienced anything like this, when i tried to contact them they say exactly whats in the email, in the live chat the lady was nice until she used the same text again. No idea what went wrong and contact is disrespectful and impossible.   it's a pity I can't buy anymore but I'm not going to beg to stay on their site, it doesn't seem smart to me that they get rid of an honest buyer. After all the reviews here I see I'm not the only one",NL

543,www.ebay.com,2022-10-05T16:03:14.000Z,2,"Mixed experience as a buyer and seller - Bad communication, features and Massive Fees","Mixed experience as a buyer and seller. Buying multiple items often does not work on their Global Shipping Programme which can cause alot of back and forth between the seller and buyer to finalise. This has some advantages though as the Global Shipping Programme has in the past charged incorrect VAT rates and is more expensive than standard post, it's not always required to go by courier. As a seller, while the reach is amazing and barrier to entry is low, the fees are very high, I was just charged an extra 5% of the total sales amunt including postage for selling a product to Australia - that sort of fee can't be justified. EBay are always changing their fee structure too so it's hard to know where you will be hit. Overall fees are way too high Try other sites where you can, alot of other sites give better fees structures for higher cost items. While Ebay can great for your continent, high volume and lower cost items - it's not great for low volumes or items that are not low cost - try free sites where you can and if your business is big enough go solo. An communication is very mixed, it took a year to get a refund on VAT over charges, trying to buy an item now and there is a system issue - both myself and the seller were given completely different advice on how to resolve.",IE
544,www.ebay.com,2022-10-05T13:13:53.000Z,1,eBay: Mis-selling/ false advertising/ false guaranteed refund promise.,"I purchased an item for £23.99 from eBay on 21/6/2022 which was advertised as ""Windows 10 Pro - 64bit - OEM - from defuncy stripped machines"". The seller was ""toba_1970"". I expected to get an operating system for Windows 10 with an appropriate Licence Number. All I received was an email showing a Licence Number which I discovered was for Windows 7 Pro, not for Windows 10 Pro. I applied for a refund. Ebay closed the refund window claiming I hadn't contacted them even though I had been sending many emails to them since purchasing the item. I found there is no way of getting an email address for eBay where anyone can make a complaint so I eventually found a Contact telephone site where I explained to a helpful gentleman what had gone on.  He said he would pass my complaint on to a review team in eBay for further investigation. I received a curt email from eBay just saying ""The return for Refurbished | Windows 10 Pro | 64bit | OEM | from defunct stripped Machines""  has been closed."" There was no response to my queries and no reasons given. So much for the eBay guaranteed refund policy when this is a clear case of mis-selling/ false advertising.",GB

I was surprised to find that the sale option is closed. That is, you can pay through Paypal for the goods, but you can’t sell. Registration in the new payment system requires very personal and banking data. No, not a credit card, but a main bank account. I have been represented on this trading platform for 12 years and this is my opinion. Both design and functionality and communication in 2022 looks poor and slow. And with such a registration system in the new payment system, small sellers are not at all interested in this trading platform. Instead of expanding the range of services and making everything more convenient, a monopoly on payments is introduced for the seller. The auction rating has dropped to 1.2. It means junk product. Isn't management interested? A very strange story, especially in a competitive environment.",IL

I have spent nearly two hours this evening with their contact centre agents and managed to get absolutely zero forward movement. Agents have a habit of disconnecting the call when you challenge the 'quality' in their service delivery. If you want to lodge a formal complaint they make it as difficult as possible meaning postal complaint ONLY - no email address etc. You need a good sense of humour when dealing with them.  Good Luck or ideally avoid spend only if you are desperate!,GB

Cue a long and exhausting group of chats with eBay. eBay FINALLY agree that the item was not delivered to the correct address but will not refund me unless Yodel sends a letter or email on official Yodel stationery (not sure how you do that on an email but I digress). Yodel say they cannot do this. eBay say they can. Back and forth, back and forth, both companies agree item has not been delivered but no refund is forthcoming. I complain to Amex and get a refund. eBay fight this and I am charged again. I send off all of the chats and emails from both Yodel and eBay to Amex and I have a refund again and so far, I have not been charged again. eBay is a total scam. It was obvious that Yodel had not delivered, and I had proof with photos and copies of chats. eBay makes it as difficult as possible to contact people, the people you speak to refuse to commit themselves to anything and ignore the things that you say.  I had ONE decent email from an employee, saying that she was going to ask for a courtesy refund, but then that was disregarded and I went back on the carousel of ""we understand how you feel BUT"".  The lost time was nearly £100, who can afford to lose that?  I have told all of my colleagues that I will no longer buy from eBay and I have recommended that they only deal with reputable suppliers like Amazon. eBay treated this problem appallingly and I heartily recommend that you do NOT use them.",GB

The seller was tardy in sending the return label (needed reminding) and since the return has failed to provide a refund despite several reminders. Initial advice from eBay was to approach the seller (which failed) and also the financial source (another story there). Both failed. eBay agents (I have the transcripts) advised me that if I shut the case with the financial source, they (eBay) would guarantee a refund. I shut the case but now eBay claim that they cannot work towards a refund. Another agent stated clearly that funds had been forwarded to the financial source; clearly untrue but eBay refuses to address this point. I have the chat transcripts of eBay not following through or dealing with the issue of a seller, using their platform, not providing refunds or of the incorrect statements from their agents. I will no longer use eBay as they have shown that they can't/won't assist when a seller is not acting according to their obligations. eBay is no different to a storefront and so how does it get to act differently?",AU

I have bought 2 fine Pontiac T/A's and sold a high end Dodge Street Machine for a total of over  $100,000.00 and also 15 years of uncountable sales and purchases.

I'd leave zero stars if it were possible. eBay forcibly migrated all the seller accounts to eBay payment accounts, when funds used to go straight to PayPal and we could quickly get OUR money. Money that belongs to us that is being held for ridiculous reasons. They may as well say ""We're forcing you to use our payment system, and by the way, we'll hold your funds whenever we fancy it.""   A typical example of a big faceless corporation failing to support the sellers that are dependent on the site for their income.

I'll say my piece clearly: eBay has zero seller protection. You can ship an item to a buyer and they can simply say ""this doesn't meet the description"" and then you, as a seller, are required to pay them return shipping. Then you have an item that is in worse condition than when you shipped it, you may get a different item altogether, you may not get all the items back at all (if you shipped more than one item in a posting, like if you sold a camera + camera accessories). And as a seller, eBay sides with the buyer - there is nothing you can do if you have an issue with the buyer once the item is out of your hands the buyer acts in bad faith. There's also a new policy where anyone selling over $600 has to upload their personal info (SSN). The $600 is not the problem - you are supposed to pay taxes on income over that amount from sales like this (unless you have a receipt proving you sold at a loss).  However, eBay mentioned this to me and held my funds and told me AFTER I sold an item. Then they have the audacity to tell me I need to: - Upload my SSN - Upload a photo license/photo document eBay has had huge data breaches before. Remember, in 2014, over 145 million users were asked to change passwords. The geniuses on the eBay community forums all say ""So what if you upload your SSN on eBay? It's not like it won't have been compromised somewhere else"". After selling a camera for $849, I didn't want to take the risk of eBay: 1. Holding my funds because I refuse to upload my a copy of my driver's license and SSN to their provably compromised platform, even if they beefed their security. All it takes is one breach.  2. Selling to a buyer who says my camera ""doesn't match the description"" and then eBay does absolutely nothing because they side with the buyer. I refunded the buyer everything and took down my listing. Terrible company. The CEO divides buyers into low-value and high-value, and wants to focus on high-ticket items. The company is underperforming - they finished ""Q2 with 138 million active buyers, a 12% decline from a year earlier"". They are focused on profits over ensuring the experience of the people using the platform, particularly the ones who actually list the items sold. eBay is going nowhere, but it's the worst time in the company's history to be a member of this platform, except maybe if you're a buyer and want to do whatever you want I suppose.

I’m looking into small claims court proceeding against eBay but if you want to bid your item up, don’t bother paying the min sales price - just ask your buddy to post up- eBay wont do a thing to them when they don’t pay and cancel and you will either not have to sell it or get an inflated price. Seems to be supported by eBay so go for it. Mgrove77 at hotmail",US
617,www.ebay.com,2022-09-21T20:07:43.000Z,1,Do not use this company!,"I have used eBay to buy things for the last 5 years and I've had no major issues.  Wary of eBay's shocking reputation with regard to selling I was hesitant to sell anything but eventually,three months ago gave in and sold an item on eBay. I got a good price ,the fees were low and there were no issues.  6 weeks ago I decided to offload some more items. A week after everything should have been settled ,after lots of Reading I eventually found something telling me that because of my suppose unusual selling behaviour my funds would be on hold untill a certain date . This would have been annoying even if had I received the money by that date , as it was approximately 3 weeks after I should have been paid but that was 2 weeks ago. Now I currently get a recurring message telling me to verify my account details which I have done repeatedly . EBay have quite happily been taking money out of the very same account for the last 5 years but the second time they were asked to pay money into my account it's asking too much. So far the limited amount of customer services that I've been able to reach have done nothing more than tell me to do the obvious steps that I have already done such as trying different bank accounts ,different devices or reloading the app. The various different excuses as to why I haven't been paid my money, tell me that no one at eBay has a clue what they're doing or how their systems work.   While I've had no big issues with buying on eBay this experience has taught me that eBay is not equipped to deal with problems if the arise,  so I won't be taking the risk of using ebay at all in the future. As annoying as doing a car boot sale may seem , it is considerably quicker, easier ,more profitable and convenient than dealing with eBay from my experience. I can't wait to close my account the second second eBay pay me what I'm owed.",GB

My seller feedback was 100% at 50300. It was never a great marketplace, but had become increasingly broken in many ways.  These include: Silently limiting my sales, in my case to exactly the UK VAT threshold over 3.5 years due to not recognising my VAT registration. Losing orders from their system resulting in problems with customers and then blaming both the seller and the buyer. Removing vital functionality from the selling tools and calling it an upgrade. Losing vital messages from customers in their messaging system and denying it. Multi-buy promotions mysteriously stopping and re-starting resulting in customers being charged a higher price at checkout than they saw advertised in the listing.  Fifteen instances of this over more than a year. That's price misrepresentation retail fraud commited on my behalf if not caught every time. Applying international postage rates incorrectly resulting in financial losses, then accusing me of changing the rate. eBay systems telling customers that I am holiday and not processing orders for no reason, then telling me that, ""This won't affect your sales."" Appending computer garbage to UK address lines as a software fix that needs to be manually removed from every address before printing labels. Forcing a useless web translation service on my account despite my having deliberately opted out of it beforehand.  This would have resulted in going over selling limits and English listings disappearing if not caught in time. Updated listing photographs not showing to customers. Completely unrelated photographs of other sellers' items appearing in listings. eBay allowing customers from excluded postage locations to place orders. Ongoing failure of search system to find items on the main site, and even within my own account using exact text matches. Impossible to cancel some orders when requested by customers due to site failure. Impossible to mark some items as dispatched due to site failure. Shockingly poor seller so-called telephone ""support"" operatives who have frequently told direct lies. All of the above failures and the eBay responses are fully documented online, should you wish to search for them. The reason for my being finally being kicked-off from this dismal toy-town website was my handing of a second letter of complaint and detailed report to UK VP Murray Lambell outside an ebay event in Reading UK on 28-JUL-2022.  eBay corporation can not face any form of the truth.

702,www.ebay.com,2022-09-07T06:27:45.000Z,3,NO CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I have never had any bad experiences with Ebay. In fact, I have only purchased items less than $30.00 which includes free shipping and always has a return policy. I carefully study the ratings of a seller, read all the customer reviews and use the zoom feature to zero in on details. I begin by contacting the seller and asking a question. If I receive no response, I do not make the purchase. I never bid because it is a pure waste of time since buyers put in last second bids. For one such listing, I was looking at the screen and thought I would end up with a lovely vase for $10.00. Within the last few seconds, the price jumped to $100, $200, $300, $400 and the final winning bid was $550. I had to correct one seller advertising a linen Provencal (French) tablecloth because the tag, as I was reading it upside down in German were the washing instructions for 100% polyester. The seller apologized and corrected the listing because she had acquired the linen as a lot from a former military wife who lived in France and Germany. The price tag did not make sense either since this lot of unused linen were all purchased before the introduction of the Euro and would have been marked DM for Deutsche Mark or F for Franc. I have encountered many superb sellers and always provide five star reviews for each of them, but Ebay's latest removal of competent customer service was a very poor decision and this is why: I am sick of virtual people and virtual chat assistants who merely refer you to the 'help' topics which are not helpful at all. There is still a number on the internet listed for customer service. I called the number hoping desperately to resolve an issue in which I received the wrong color of a cotton sweater and the seller refused to let me return it and issue a refund. When the man answered the phone and asked me what my concern was, the first thing I said was, ""You do not have an American accent."" His reply was, ""I'm British."" I said, ""I have lived in England for many years and that is not a British accent but an Indian one."" He contested this retorting, ""Well, I have lived all over the world so my accent has changed."" To which I replied, ""Well, I have also traveled and lived all over the world, learning multiple languages and I still have an American accent."" He next started telling me about how he taken this customer service job to support his wife and two children. This was completely inappropriate and made me suspicious. What do I care about how he supports his family? He then told me in order to get a refund to open up an app on my cell phone. When I looked at the app there was a large flashing orange triangle and underneath it read, ""If you continue, this will enable anyone to read your email, text messages and pay using your cell phone."" When I refused to continue, this person became very aggressive, a definite RED FLAG for a SCAMMER. I hung up. I sold one item on Ebay, a stunning 14K gold bracelet with 42 small opals. My starting price was 1/2 of its appraised value because people do not purchase used jewelry. It came from an estate sale and I never wore it. The buyer was very pleased but I was shocked how much money Ebay took from my sale! NEVER call the listed number and forget about customer service and the 100% Ebay guarantee. It does not exist. By the way, this review was generated by a virtual person. Haha!",US

As soon I received notification about the purchase of the item that I already sold, but forgot to drop from eBay sales, I contacted the buyer and reassure him that I WILL refund the money to him ASAP. As soon the funds were in my checking account I contacted eBay explaining the situation and the buyers request to expedite the refund as he need it the money to buy a similar item from another seller.  That was a fair request, so knowing eBay will not be a fast process, I decided after consulting with eBay customer service representative, my intent to refund the money via PayPal.  eBay customer service representative gave me the green light and asked me to send them copies of the transaction made on PayPal.  I completed the refund and submitted everything to eBay. I refunded the buyer on Jun 13 but the buyer never canceled the claimed he submitted.

I have had the unfortunate job of selling graphics cards on Ebay. It is an absolute nightmare. Half the buyers don't pay. When they do pay, they keep trying to get you to ship internationally or a week later you'll get a claim for wrong graphic card model and photo of some other card you weren't selling that is probably broken. Ebay doesn't care. They will try to force you to eat the cost and refund the seller. My latest was a customer that said he didn't receive the item. UPS showed the package as delivered. The buyer waited 5 days before he said he didn't receive it and that his ""friend"" was waiting for it. I used Ebay to print the UPS label and has it all saved under my username. I dispute the claim since it does show delivered and ebay comes back with a hold. They are asking me for a postal receipt showing the address I used. I used their partnership service through Ebay to print the label. They provided the customers address. Ebay then automated that address and I bought the label and shipped it. They are still asking me for a postal receipt. They don't help sellers at all, they don't use any critical thinking on claims or cases. They WILL hold your money at any point in time because in their stupid agreement it allows them to do whatever they want with your money. You aren't the owner of the money until they pay you. They are. Stay away. Find a service that acknowledges that verifies their sellers, pays them when the transaction is done because if you buy an item anywhere else, you would receive the money prior to handing over the item or it would be at the exact same time. Sellers with 3+ years of Ebay, great feedback and verified shouldn't have to go through this much of a nightmare to get something sold and then finally get their money.",US

(I tried for the first time a month or so ago).  1. You can't see your original listing once an item has sold. I've just run into this glitch that means a buyer has purchased an item in a bid that I had designated as for sale for a set amount/buy only, meaning they have purchased it for much less than I intended. I tried to see my original listing/advert and it was impossible. I contacted ebay to find out what the hell is going on and was told 'it's a known bug and the technical team are looking into it. Please allow us some time. It will be resolved soon...' Blah, blah, blah. And what do I tell the buyer who has paid much below the asking price for my product??? 2. eBay make it almost impossible to actually chat to a person to get help with an issue. i had to choose a totally irrelevant option in order to just get to this chat box feature. it is impossible to modify listing details once they are live, i have had to pay postage where it has been stipulate the buyer has already paid it, the postage i have paid to ebay and calculated carefully has been deemed inadequate at the post office and i have not known whether my parcels have been delivered. i hate ebay and after i have sold this item i am never using it again. pass this feedback on. Ebay is alright for buyers, not for sellers. 3. Ebay make it almost impossible to actually chat to a person to get help with an issue. I had to choose a totally irrelevant option in order to just get to a cruddy chat box feature.  4. It is impossible to modify listing details once they are live - WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS - (unless this is also some temporary glitch/'issue' they are having)  5. I have had to pay postage nearly every time, as a seller, where it has been stipulated the BUYER HAS ALREADY PAID IT. This means that the already meagre money I have made after eBay take their cut is even less! 6. The postage I have paid to Ebay via PayPal and arrived at carefully (via EBAY'S OWN INTERNAL CALCULATOR) has been deemed inadequate at the post office and I have not known whether my parcels have been delivered.  7. On top of everything else the website is exceptionally non-user-friendly as a seller and you're pretty sure you have stipulated one thing in the advert and lo and behold you haven't, or you've stipulated something else.

Immediately, I received an email from them saying that I was permanently banned. They elaborated, obtusely, that, in order to protect the safety of their community, this was not appealable. (A lack of appeals is hardly a measure of safety). They won't tell you this, but if you use a VPN, you're immediately banned. I contested it. I received two different answers: one telling me to submit proof of my name and address, and another telling me that there was no function to overcome the ban. I submitted my information, and the unappealable appeal was accepted.  The true malice came when I sold an item. I think it was some sticks of RAM. The idiot buyer interpreted ""picked up by [carrier]"" as someone else picking up the RAM to keep it. It was literally the carrier picking it up to begin shipment. They threw a dishonest, hysterical fit and made a false claim to eBay.  In its response, eBay sided with me, but criticized me because the package shipped a day after the label was printed. This was irrelevant. In another case, eBay approved a refund on the basis that the buyer returned the item to me. The buyer never returned the item to me. eBay's own tracking showed this. I appealed it and won. If I could sit down with these agents, I would criticize them as being incompetent to the point that I doubt their status as functional adults.",US

When I ask to speak to someone at the corporate headquarters ( in San Diego,Ca) I was put on hold and the call was disconnected. The customer service people r fine when they can answer from a script. Any question or problem not on the ‘script’ results in a 30-60 minute call and no answer. Supervisors are never available. Giving me more $’s to sell seems to be a win-win situation but not as far as Ebay is concerned. They would rather make less sales, less money and anger there real customers who really are the sellers.

I contacted Royal Mail who told me I could make a claim but I had to wait until a certain date where they deem the letter missing. I told the buyer to contact me on this date if it still hasn’t arrived. Flash forward 5 months later the buyer makes a claim against me stating the item never arrived… interesting how they were so keen to message me in the first few days but as soon as I gave them a date to contact me by they were silent. As it was 5 months since I sent the order I couldn’t even open a claim with Royal Mail as they only keep information for 80 days. Ebay don’t offer any seller protection unless you ship with a tracked service (which mine wasn’t as it was a large letter with just a stamp) and won’t even consider your case even if you have the evidence showing you were willing to help the customer. The whole situation is fishy and the buyer knew I could’ve got them a refund, so why wait 5 months? Strange. Needless to say I won’t be selling with eBay again.",GB

I believe that as long as you follow all the guidelines eBay will always be on your side and provide support where it is needed.

Following the tracking number I found out that the item has been sent to the same city but a different person and different address.

The company is crap, but there are still buyers out there.  So list product accordingly.  You can make money, but you have to charge up front, overprice your items, and accept the fact that ebay will not protect you as a seller or buyer.  They are only there to introduce you to each other.  After that, the gloves come off and you're on your own. I sell on my own website and price everything I sell on ebay about 30% more than my website.  I have to in order to recoup the costs of selling in ebay as well as the cost of scammers and ebays lack of assistance for sellers.  I do not accept returns (I do on my website, but not on ebay).  I essentially use ebay as advertising to help guide people to my website.  But, alas, some people still buy through ebay when a simple google search would have saved them.  I've also closed my ebay store and only pay a fixed fee for selling. My advice is to rarely buy anything over ebay.  If you do, it should only be for an odd-ball item that you could only find on ebay, and only if it is inexpensive.  There are a LOT of great sellers and buyers on ebay and the vast majority can be trusted.  However, if you do get scammed, don't look for help from ebay. I'm writing this review today because of another massive flaw in ebay's algorithm for sellers.  I regularly test the ebay search terms to make sure it is finding my product.  As of yesterday an organized group of sellers, who found a loophole in ebay's product listings, figured out a way to completely flood ebay with the same product offered by about 90 different sellers, most all of them ranked as top rated.  Doing a product search only brings back dozens of listings of the same product (Driver Education Brake).  Only 2-3 of the listings show free shipping.  All the others (about 70 of them) show shipping of a 2lb, $88 dollar item costing between $1,000 and $100,000.  Essentially what this group of sellers is doing (or possibly a single person) is that all 100 of them list the same item for about the same cost, but only 1-2 of them list it with free shipping.  The rest all list it with thousands of dollars for shipping.  So what happens is when you search for that product, the query returns a flood of hits for the same product which forces all other competition off the screen.  Yet only 1-2 of them show free shipping.  Buyers are literally only seeing one product. Almost all the sellers are rated as Top Rated sellers.  To accomplish this, I believe they are all working together.  They agree to list the same product and only 1-2 of them are able to list their product with free shipping.  They are doing this with multiple products to shut down competition. I contacted ebay about this (and contrary to the reviews, I've always been able to get a human on the phone with ebay, but it isn't easy) and after explaining it to two different reps, they finally understood what I was telling them and filed an internal report. I'm highly doubtful anything will come of it.  I've placed several technical support issues in the past and after months and months, they just closed the ticket with my problem unresolved.  In every customer experience survey they send out, in the comments section, I always write, ""If anyone is reading this, please contact me and I will personally pay you $100.  I need technical support.""  Nobody ever calls.  LOL!  Their surveys are a joke.  Nothing changes. I also sell on Amazon and when listing a product on their site, they work hard to make sure duplicate listings from different sellers are consolidated into a single listing with multiple offers from various sellers.  This prevents what is happening on ebay.  Better company run by smarter people. So in brief, if you do business on ebay, understand your risks and price your product accordingly.  Don't believe anything they tell you over the phone and don't expect any real help from support.",US

My gut told me something was wrong as I never had an item sell so fast.  I called Ebay to confirm the sale was legitimate and that the payment had really been received.  The Ebay representative checked and said everything was up and up and it was okay for me to ship the item which I did immediately as I promised in my sales ad I would do.  The camera was delivered as promised, but it was only then did I notice that payment had not been received as Ebay assured me.  I tried everything to get in touch with the seller only to find out the seller (Mercado Gonzales using a Miami address) was a scammer and that Ebay led me wrong by confirming that the deal was legitimate. For the next few weeks, I submitted detailed reports to eBay’s Security Center and appropriate police departments.    Here is how the story ends: No one except me and my family cares about my loss.  eBay gave me no support as a long-time seller and buyer They accepted no responsibility for my loss even though it was their confirmation that the sale was legitimate that gave me the green light to mail the camera to the thief. The police department in Miami never got back to me nor did any of the other agencies I wrote to for help.  Basically, none of them cares. Here is my conclusion to this nightmare I’ve been living.  eBay will not help you if you get ripped off.  eBay also does not approve of sellers disclosing situations like this and blacklisting scammers by their latest fake name and address.  So, I am out $3000 for a new old stock camera and left with no trust anymore in buying or selling on eBay since they don’t care to support their clients when things go wrong.  They will also tell you someone will get back to you soon to discuss what to do next.   They never get back to you.  They lie, lie, and lie. The outcome of my bad experience has taught me that eBay is now one of the added institutions that cannot be trusted in a world that supports criminal justice by letting the criminals go free.

The seller obviously damaged it himself, and convinced eBay that I did it.  I appealed and they said they would get back to me within 48 hours.  They didn't.  I appealed again, they said they would get back to me within 48 hours.  They didn't.  Now, several week later, they say I can't appeal.  The seller lied to eBay and they took his word for it.

He had tampered with the packaging after delivery, removed the item took what he needed then re sealed with a different colour tape and requested a return.  I believe he misused the eBay money back guarantee to use the item to repair his own and then return a damaged item with missing parts.  Of course eBay just ignored the evidence provided and refunded the buyer in full.  Beware who you sell to. Ebay will not fight your corner even if you can prove the buyer is committing Fraud.

He told me he would send again and that it would take 4 -5 weeks to get it.  Since that time I haven't heard from the seller. So I contacted eBay and was told that they would contact the seller and have them give me the refund. They also said that if the seller didn't respond by July 31 they would step in.

The fees are very high and to my mind crazy. They charge over 12% if someone contacts you! Even if you don't sell the vehicle on ebay! That's could be a whopping fee if you selling a high value bike. Here's the EBAY line ""If your item doesn't sell you usually don't pay a final value fee. However, if you offer or reference your contact information to another user or ask a buyer for their contact information, in the context of buying or selling outside of eBay, we charge a final value fee for introducing you to the buyer. In this case, the final value fee is based on the higher of the fixed price, auction start price, Buy it now price, reserve price or the price identified between the buyer and seller."" WOW!! So if some random says they are interested you could be in for a hefty fee from EBay. I have noticed that the number of bikes on sale is dropping. No wonder. Wanted to contact ebay and ask them for comment request help ... all you get are BOTS. No customer service.  Private sellers beware final fee is based on not just the final sale value of the item or what they consider the final value. Final value includes any postal charges etc. Really!

After all of that I had had enough and bailed. It was strictly a selling account, I had no outstanding fees, I owed eBay no money, I deactivated my account and before deactivating my account I took down all my listings.  • Fast forward years later (two months ago) I moved into a new home and recently have really gotten into antiques so I decided to make another eBay account because there's so many antiques on eBay and it was the most affordable place I looked at. Welp that didn't work because within a few minutes of making that account eBay permanently suspended it citing ""I broke the community rules and was a danger to the community"" whatever the heck that means, so then I make another account and the same thing happens, make another account and within a week the same thing happens, I gave up didn't try again for two more weeks then made another account but this account lasted the longest at about a month and a week but still it was also permanently suspended and once again citing ""I broke the community rules and was a danger to the community"" (FYI this just happened tonight). I looked into it and realized it couldn't be because of my old account because as I said before I owed no money on that account, took down all my listings and deactivated it but that the most likely cause is that a previous owner of my home wasn't in good standing with eBay and they blacklisted my address (if you didn't know eBay can and does blacklist addresses and names so if you share the same name as someone who is on eBay's ""bad"" list, you live at the same address as someone who's on eBay's ""bad"" list or live at the address someone who's on eBay's ""bad"" list formerly lived at you're SOL) and cannot make an account with them and if you do it'll either be instantly permanently suspended or will be permanently suspended eventually once they catch on. Another fun tid bit is that there's no way to get around it, fix it or change it because trust me I tried. It's funny how eBay keeps going on and on about caring about the buyers, the sellers and about the community's ""safely"" but how they've treated me and thousands to millions of other people completely contradicts that. But what gets me really mad about all of this is that I recently placed and paid for multiple orders but if my account is permanently suspended my account no longer exists, the seller can't ship to me, can't refund me, I can't contact them, they can't contact me, I can no longer get into or access my account to see item details/order details, it makes trying to have a chargeback done impossible, my orders that have already been shipped out before the suspension can no longer be tracked, if a seller I bought from ended up being a scammer I have no way to report them return the item and get my money back, etc basically they screwed me over for no reason and all while trying to act like they're these perfect saints who have the community's best interest at heart... yeah right 🤣 Just really bums me out that I not only potentially lost my money, lost the items I paid for and really wanted, lost my buying account that I built up to be really good over the past month or so but also that all the connections with really amazing antique sellers I made is null and void now 🤷🏻‍♀️ Screw you eBay, seriously.  Bottom line is eBay is an absolute nightmare to deal with. I don't know why I even bothered to come back and honestly believed that in the years i've been gone that eBay has gotten better because they're just as bad if not worse as they were before.

My wife is very methodical and carefully reviewed all of eBay policies before posting 26 items for sale and sold 3 items in 5 days.  On the 5th day of selling Ebay suspended the account and deleted all our adds for no apparent reason (which took many hours to do with taking my own photos etc). We contacted them by chat and they said it is their policy not never to disclose any reasons why as it might help people circumvent their policies.  We diligently re-checked all of their policies together looking for any potential conflict and could not find any possible breaches of any of their policies. So from their chat, they say they cannot disclose which policies were breached, it appears that eBay have secret policies that they are not willing to disclose which pose a huge risk to sellers businesses because they won't disclose what they are. If this doesn't make sense to you, don't worry, it doesn't make any sense to a lot of people who now avoid eBay all together. So if you are thinking of starting an eBay business better think it through. Just know that they will remove your adds, ruin your business, hold your income indefinitely and suspend your account (even if you have 100% feedback and no cases) and they will no tell you why or give you any chance to answer for or fix any alleged breaches. You'll just be finished up, without income and you won't see it coming as happened to us and many others if you care to search. The fact that their culture makes them unaccountable for any decision affecting sellers livelihoods and their total failure give any reason, help, assistance or explanation for any of their actions in my own personal opinion is unconscionable and shows contempt towards small sellers.  When I started researching other such instances and criticism from eBay sellers I came across many such instances and also discovered a recent court case in the US federal court for staff threats and intimidation of those critical to their organization, which can be searched under eBay Execs charged in the Federal Court.  So if you are thinking of starting a business selling online, it might be a good idea to pay a little more attention and research the culture of the online market place the you want to join, and for me it will never be eBay with their secret squirrel behavior.  There are plenty of eBay competitors in the space which are more seller friendly to go with, eBay is not even the largest.

I started using it to feel safe about selling items as they offer seller protection but when sellers need it most they point the blame at the post offer or come up with some dumb reason as to why the buyer gets refunded.

So I’ve paid for two items I’ve not received, with no proof of delivery, yodel unable to confirm, I’ve spent hours chasing sellers courier, even tried to appeal eBay’s decision only to be told I have 7 days to produce a POND (point of non delivery document) Yodel said they’d investigate please allow 30 days!

The appeals process is laughable. You are given the ability to upload ONE image of rebuttal evidence in your appeal. Anybody that does not know how to merge appendices into one image will instantly be scolded and have to give up at this point. There is no box to type out any wording so the wording has to be typed onto the image itself requiring knowledge of image processing. After squashing 4 pieces of evidence into one image showing the buyer's purchase, proof of receipt, email correspondence and proof that the order conformed to its description, the buyer's bank favoured with the buyer and refunded them. eBay did their bit of charging a £14.00 dispute fee. To make things worse the refund and the dispute fee are interwoven within your eBay account finances so if you dare to appeal the refund with your bank AS A SELLER, eBay will stop you from selling, suspend your account and/or try to repeatedly rebill you. In summary, sellers have an appalling and atrocious appeals process that the average person cannot use. If the appeals process does not fall in your favour contesting this with your bank is fruitless because eBay will counter-dispute and restrict your account until they can recollect the funds from either your bank account or through a positive sales balance.",GB

I did for many years buying and selling vintage pro analog equipment. Can’t do that anymore. Nowadays everybody is hip and everybody is a criminal until they’re not. There’s more scam artists than decent honest people anymore. eBay’s policies reflect that so much and it’s very sad, because the costs involved are getting higher and higher to the point where I don’t think it’s worth selling on eBay. But on occasion, I take a chance and buy something. I just bought a MacBook Pro and it’s a fantastic computer! Then again, I recently sold a analog mixing console and the cost involved in selling on eBay were astronomical! I lost so much money and I don’t even want to tell you how much, but it was a lot and I will never do that again.

I am trying to sell a very high end items and highly popular brands like CHANEL, DIOR and few others but it shows me that only one or two people viewed my listing, on the other hand eBay is suggesting to pay them $1,99 to boost your listing, seriously? eBay is dead!

I associated it successfully with my ebay account. I then tried to checkout on a $77 transaction which required my debit card since I was still $2 short. My debit card was declined and the transaction was cancelled. The $75 gift card amount was never put back on my gift card. I called right away and was told it would take 5 days. 5 days later I called and was told it would take 7 days. 2 days later I called and they wanted me to upload proof of purchase which I immediately did I waited 2 days to call back and was told 24 hours to be resolved. I called.back after 24 hours and was told 5 days again. I waited 5 days and now told 7 days to resolve which takes me to today each time I was told I would get a call back. Not one time have I got a call back. Each time they have to email the gift card department and wait for reply which never happens. Every rep that actually asked for my gift card number saw happened but couldn’t help. The 2nd rep i spoke with issued me a $10 courtesy credit this is all Insane.

Of all of them, EBay has turned into one of the safest, and is by far the most seller-friendly.  On the buying side, if there's a real problem buying something, you can get your money back quickly and easily. As far as selling, they've gone from being one of the worst a few years ago to now being the best, hands down. There are very few barriers, the work flow is generally well thought out, and access to their API is easy, and for the most part small businesses can succeed right alongside the big ones. Getting help is easy and accurate.  Now compare that to selling on Amazon, for example. Amazon has big barriers to even get started, then they throw up roadblocks and major hurdles every step of the way. They'll suspend accounts because of AI mistakes and they apparently have another equally stupid AI that denies it when you appeal them. Only the biggest businesses can access their API, everyone else is banned from using it. EBay does none of this.",US

1123,www.ebay.com,2022-06-16T15:34:23.000Z,2,Ebay review as a buyer and seller,"Ebay Buying and selling complete review Selling-  Positives: Mostly easy to list items, can successfully sell many products in a short period of time. Target wider audience. Good for anyone looking to make some quick money.  Negatives: Sellers on eBay will encounter the most problems on this site. Firstly, eBay's seller protection is little to nothing. It is entirely feasible for a buyer to make a false claim regarding the item description and eBay will refund them. Always, ensure that your shipments are fully insured to avoid this! Cancelling orders will cause permanent suspension/limitation. I started to list products from my business, and naturally some of these items would end up being sold in store and then later on eBay. As a result, I had to cancel some orders. eBay then restricted me to two listings and even though it's been five months, I haven't had the suspension lifted.  I haven't really had any poor experiences with buyers outside of one who made a false claim. I have since put a disclaimer on listings to help ward off any fraudsters/scammers.  It's become really difficult for middlemen to sell products on eBay. Especially, since there are many legitimate business using the platform to sell products at reduced cost.  Also, if you have a product that is gaining a lot of exposure/sales. Don't be surprised to see other sellers start selling the same item at a lower price. The eBay marketplace is constantly bombarded with sellers looking to undercut each other on price, no matter how little profit they actually make.  Buyers Positives- Can purchase a diversity of different products. There are quite a few bargains. Lots of products that may not be available elsewhere/sold out. Money back guarantee on faulty items.  Negatives- Can't guarantee item will be as described.  Always read the description and look at the pictures closely to ensure your getting the product you wanted. Although eBay's money back guarantee is effective and has worked for me in many instances. This can no longer be used if a month has passed. Also, not getting the product you wanted and having to ship back the old one is time consuming and exhausting. Price inflation on many items, especially products that are in demand.  Most products on eBay now are much more expensive then you would find at other retailers including amazon. Again, always do your research and don't presume you're getting the best deal. Although you will find bargains, their is greater possibility of the product not being as described.  Dodgy sellers will manipulate their listings to make a better impression. For example, zooming into the item so you don't realize the actual size in the listing pictures.  Also to conclude, customer service, complaints department is 0/5. Their job is to pretty much carry out what you can already do on the website. Don't understand why their not just replaced with a automated machine. Don't call them and don't waste your time being transferred unnecessarily.",GB

They advertised the phone as brand new, the phone worked great until this past week after using it very lightly for only 6 months. The item has suspiciously disappeared from my purchase history. I call for help and here is where it goes from BAD TO WORSE. I requested all the info and the original receipt from eBay on 6/11/22, they said it will only take a couple days. As of today, after just hanging up with eBay they suggested it may take up to 10 days to get this info. I have maintained 100% feedback for over 25 years on eBay, but just one scum like this seller can spoil the entire party.  *** BEWARE OF SCAMMER WORLDWIRELESSSTAR advertises BRAND NEW PHONES but when you get them the 1st thing you shkuld do immediately is to call the phone Mfg to register the phone. During the call you should ask if this phone has ever been turned on for servixe prior to this, as we just purchased this as BRAND NEW IN A BOX. I called Samsung and gave them the IMEI number for the phone - they told me the lbone was originally turned on for service in Nov 2019. This proves that WorldWirelessStar is a THIEF, LIAR and should immediately be dealt with by eBay. I suggested they immediately FREEZE his accounys until  thoroughly audit on every NOTE 9 phone that he sold. If they find this is normal he should be visiting a Michigan State Correction Facility for a very long stay. Lesson learned here - when buying  new phone on eBay on avoiding the scam that got me. 1st - call the phone Mfg to register you new phone. 2nd - during this call ask the representative if this phone really is brand new. As them if this is the first time this phone was put into service? You only have 30 days for a money back policy with eBay. Needless to say I would buy anything on eBay anymore agter seeing how they treat me after they allowed a seller to INTENTIONALLY LIE ABOUT THE PHONE BEING BRAND NEW. In my opinion, eBay looks for these scammer sellers as these sellers have no morals and would sell anything to make a buck. Thye usually have high volume and that makes their pockets filled with money.  eBay sucks IMO.",US

After numerous phone calls with their useless employees, it was determined that only people who have placed a bid or are currently watching the item only able to see the product. It was an error on their part and nothing they could do to resolve it. Since there was less than a day left on the item, I decided to keep it listed and continue with the auction. The item was sold and the buyer paid within a day. I saw the funds in my eBay account and shipped the item. After I shipped it, I noticed that my account had been placed “on hold.” After multiple calls with their useless employees again, I it was determined that my account had been placed on hold because the product needed to be delivered. The product was finally delivered and noticed that my account was still placed on a hold. So, I called their useless employees again and now they are telling me it could take up to 15 days to get my payment. This has been a first and last time experience for me.

1145,www.ebay.com,2022-06-11T00:29:51.000Z,1,The Real Reason eBay Always Refunds Fraudulent Buyer Claims,"I use to be a big cheerleader for eBay. Loved eBay. I hate selling on eBay now. eBay has cultivated a base of fraudulent customers. I have buyers opening false fraudulent claims due to buyers remorse. Some of these claims are so outrageous that eBay customer service agents will exclaim “the customer is obviously lying!!”, “the customer is abusing the claims process!!”, “eBay has your back!!” Yet EVERY TIME eBay will automatically refund the fraudulent buyer and literally steal money from me to refund the buyer. I don’t always get my merchandise back. When I do it might be a purse stuffed with feces or an intentionally destroyed item of clothing. EVERY TIME this happens there is no recourse for me. eBay tells me that they cannot verify that the I did not intentionally cause the damage myself. In the latest fraudulent claim i had from a customer (customer was disappointed a backpack was several inches smaller than she expected because “yeah I didn’t click on the item description with the measurements and description because I wanted the one you were selling”. Seriously?!? When I declined to refund her, she told me I was a bully because I was not allowing her to have a positive customer experience on eBay. I contacted eBay about the claim and as per usual-eBay customer service lied and told me that they could see it was a baseless claim- I knew eBay would fully refund the buyer and then charge me for an excessively expense return mailing label. I was told by Rowena C. from eBay that eBay will indeed honor every claim from a buyer, even patently false claims, because if they do not honor EVERY claim, then these same scum bag buyers will file claims with their credit card companies and eBay will have charge back fees! Then she merrily appended this email with a weirdly cheerful message about how I could recoup my losses by re-listing the returned item! So be fore warned: eBay will, by their own admission, honor every fraudulent claim against you as a seller. eBay will reach into your payouts and take whatever they see fit, and give your money to fraudulent buyers, in order to keep their profits at a high level. I am no financial genius but this business practice seems short sighted and plainly moronic. Take your business elsewhere and DO NOT sell on this corrupt unethical platform. I have migrated my inventory to Etsy and Poshmark.",US

I would prefer browsing thorugh specific categories that were clearly defined. Why they would destroy what was once excellent is beyond my comprehension.

Watch out for scammers. Unfortunately, Ebays platform favors the buyers and not long term sellers. Even with a near perfect selling history, a buyer can deem the item is not as described for any reason they seem fit and request a full refund. As shipping is now so expensive, it generally doesn't make economical sense to have the items shipped back to you. These buyers with false claims gain the item and shipping for free. This is an ongoing scam that sellers need to be aware of.  3. Warning - this may be shocking! This is not actually a fair or even authentic auction platform. I just recently found out 2 of my items were flagged and removed because I started the bidding price too low and after contacting Ebay on 2 different occassions with separate customer service agents, they both verified that Ebay does not want price gouging scenarios.

I provided it. Then they asked for proof of identification including my driver's license and a bank statement. I provided this as well. On my license it says I am 21, 22 in a week. However, because my parents started my ebay account when I was 15, I am punished and out $750???? In the seven years of having this account... Never buying or selling before I was 18... Why am I being penalized? Ebay never has requested any of my information before.  Maybe that's because I never had any money in my Ebay account? This is a significant amount of money and it's not coincidence that Ebay is doing this to me now. You are trying to steal my money... I am absolutely furious with Ebay and the handling of both of my cases. I honestly don't even care if you delete or suspend my account anymore... It will keep me from being scammed out of more money. HOWEVER... I am owed $750. How am I receiving this money?",US

I sold items on the 22nd of May and they were delivered by 26th of May and I have yet to receive any funds. When I talked to eBay, I was told that there was a 14 day hold on the funds even though the item was already delivered to the buyer and I have received a positive review. I think this is entirely too long to receive money after an item has been received. In addition I had to talk to someone to help me void the duplicate shipping labels. eBay should make it easier to not automatically create duplicate labels. I talked to an agent at eBay and initially she tried to tell me that one of the items I was describing I had not listed. She then goes on to list the items that I did have and mentioned the one she said I didn’t have listed. When I pointed this out to her, she got an attitude.

I checked again with a supervisor who asked for my documents, only to send me an email in the next day that still gave no reason whatsoever about why my account was suspended. That's the worst customer service I've ever seen in any website, and doing some research I found out that that's a common issue.

I have had an issue with my account for about 6 months now where it asks you to verify your email. Once you recieve a code to your email I input this into ebay to verify and an error always occurs. I must have tried this about 50 times.  To get around this I then click the back button and it automatically signs me in. I am still able to buy products.  Now the problem is it is impossible to sell anything upon clicking the approve listing button because it redirects you to a page to verify your date of Birth and banking details. These are all in 3 stages and on the last stage it states  ""Something went wrong. Please try again later."" Raised 1st ticket no. 1-437534423589 on the 16th May Raised 2nd ticket no.  1-437829739408 on the 18th May Raised 3rd ticket no. 1-438860140646 on the 24th May Was promised each ticket would be resolved in 48 hours 8 days later from the first ticket,  no email and nothing has been done at all.

Contact customer service to try to argue this to get paid, get no where but now have a payment restriction on my account where now delivery must be confirmed killing my sales of seeds that are sent with free shipping and no tracking. All because I argued to get paid for an item even the buyer is being prevented from paying for by EBay.  Then when I go to log in tonight after spending several hours on the phone trying to resolve this earlier today my account in now completely restricted so I call these worthless eBay people again. Suddenly now it’s cause they must confirm my identity...  this company is just trash , so many hassles , eBay does everything they can to keep your money as I believe eBay itself is became the fraudsters.  I delisted 100 items tonight after they removed all my listings as they put my account on restriction untill I called , then they relisted all my products ( with out the bidders bids or the watchers that were watching and or bidding prior to them delisting all my items) destroying my account and all my work I’ve put into this account. Like I want a 100 products listed and ending all at the exact same time.  They cost me money , deserve to be sued ...

I expected this unjustified feedback to ""drop off"" after 12 months, as it is supposed to do, but it is now well over 12 months and I have contacted Customer Services to request that it be removed, and the Agent was just not interested and refused to remove it, so it's there for eternity, it seems.

This success, however, has only been due to my good understanding of the limits of the service they offer. If you are shopping on the second-hand market, eBay is probably the best place in the world. Their ability to connect buyers and sellers, as well as the availability and selection of used goods are unsurpassed. But that's about all you get. They fall short in almost every other segment of their operations. eBay is ripe with fraud due to the decentralized business model they adopted, which they are unable to keep under control. Their competition beats them in terms of quality of service, consumer protection, customer support, price competitiveness, shopping experience, website functionality, and security. eBay is unethical about their advertising practices. Their consumer protection program is rather nonexistent. Yes, you will get a no-hassle refund for purchases of $5 or $20, but see what happens when you get swindled out of $200 or more. Scripted responses, plenty of runarounds, and sweeping under the carpet. In those cases customers don't come first any longer. eBay PR folks, please don't bother responding to this commentary, just let it be. Nobody cares about your damage control efforts. Reinvest your creativity into improving customer experiences on both ends, it will be more beneficial to all of us.",US

For the following reasons: 1) I listed a phone for auction in excellent condition and sent it to the buyer as advertised. The phone sustained damage on the buyer's end and they requested a return EVEN THOUGH I had specified in the listing that I did not accept returns. I reached out immediately to Ebay and in a nutshell they told I HAD to accept the return. fine, whatever. I decided not to fight it EVEN THOUGH, I can no longer sell it in excellent condition and will now earn less money for the item. 2) They made me pay for the return shipping label. SO on top of losing money with a now damaged phone, I have to pay money to have it sent back to me. ok. 3) I had to speak to 3 different agent to finally be able to process the refund once the item had been returned to me because I had opened a case asking for their help in the first place.  4) When they finally processed the refund, my account showed a negative balance for $80 more than what Ebay had paid out to me for the item.  5) I had to speak to 3 more people to explain to them that although I was happy to return the money paid to me for the item(at this point I just wanted to be done) I would not be paying the $80 because that was not the amount that I was paid. They tried to sell me on some nonsense about that money having already been refunded to my account, which made no sense. I asked for a supervisor. She said that she would process a credit for $77 because their records showed that they had paid out to me $3 more than what it reflected in my bank account. WHAT? fine. The fight is leaving me. I'm not going to fight for $3. 6) She said the credit would take 24-48hrs to process. 3 days later and NOTHING. On good faith, I pay the amount that was ACTUALLY paid out to me and 10 mins later EBay uses that ame payment method to take the rest out of my account, WITHOUT MY PERMISSION!! I don't know what that's called where you're from but where I'm from that's stealing. And there's nothing on my account OR my email that says that they're processing a credit. I speak to 3 MORE people and  7) Apparantely the supervisor LIED TO ME because there is nothing on their account that says a credit has been processed or requested. So I had to file an appeal.

Ebay said the case was given a final decision in my favor and that no further action was needed on my part. I never heard anything else about it until I was looking through order history and saw $0 for that item's final sale value. I went back into the case details and found they had refunded the buyer without communicating with me that they changed their mind. Chatting with a rep, they had indeed reversed their decision without telling me AND allowed the buyer to keep the item because ""I was unable to provide a return label."" Why would I provide a return label for an item that I was told the case was decided in my favor? Before clicking into details, the case page STILL says the final decision was in my favor. In the end, the buyer got the money AND the item while ebay robbed me quietly. Scam company.",US

I chatted with a customer representative and ask if I could get a voucher/credit for that amount to use on my next purchase and he told me that was impossible. His solution was to either ask the seller to cancel the order (which has already been sent) or wait for another similar item to be listed and purchase that one so I could apply the coupon code and return the one I already ordered! This is such a ridiculous solution! Which company is not able to generate a voucher for their client? This is just a standard and small gesture of goodwill and eBay is unwilling to provide this.,GB

Ruthlessly wealthy oligarchs have successfully turned more people into incompetently corrupt workers that screw over buyers and sellsers internationally with all these lies, the political corruption, etc. Delivery truck drivers used to do their jobs better. So, now buyers are starting to see their products get damaged after getting delivered or missing. So, these buyers are getting damaged products that don't match the product description that was online. Because these modern delivery truck drivers barely know what they're doing since ruthlessly wealthy oligarchs have made working conditions horrendously unlivable for lower class citizens internationally. The delivery service industry has been infested with political corruption to keep these ruthlessly wealthy oligarchs living in luxury while others suffer via unlivable wages, not much leisure time, and other lack of employment benefits. Depression, anxiety, lack of decent education, alcoholism, political corruption destroying professionalism, and other things are common in the delivery service industry. So, these customers are basically fending for themselves when trying to get products after buying them online. eBay is involved in this political corruption that screws over people who are lower class than these wealthy oligarchs. Professional standards have decreased from this eBay company as a result in favour of political corruption caused by wealthy oligarchs. Such a shame that companies like eBay have went downhill because wealthy oligarchs want to make our world burn instead of making it better. Even the Chinese and Indian sellers are scamming buyers on this website and Amazon, too. China and India are puppet nations for the economically powerful American empire. This American empire has a military-industrial complex used for bullying nations into political corruption. Which is why you have these desperate con artists in China and India trying to sell products because the American empire has created that situation. Because these ruthless oligarchs from the American empire would rather make the world burn with political corruption than let companies like eBay have proper professionalism while treating delivery truck drivers with respect to prevent these damaged and missing products.",IS

So I bought. The sneakers passed the authenticity check, but when I got them there was a big black blemish on them and the texture was also worn down. I notified eBay right away, followed their process, and sent them detailed photos. They basically told me that I’m stuck with them and they won’t do anything because from their perspective they passed authenticity check and the seller has no returns marked. Two problems here .. 1) there is no sense of quality check with the authenticity check and 2) even though their policy says the money back guarantee has you covered for sellers that don’t accept returns, they will not honor it.

NEVER AGAIN, it’s literally a waste of your time and better off using shpock or vinted. They have changed the way you get paid and it takes ages to get paid for something not only that they charge over 12% of whatever you sell. They also make you post the item out before getting paid so if you sell somethin it’s literally no longer worth it for small items that sell for cheap. I’ve also noticed not many people actually are looking for clothes on there anymore like they used to. It will only be good to use for specific branded items that will sell for something worth ur time and effort",GB

My story is as follows: In August 2021 I sold an item to a buyer for £500.  The transaction went smoothly and i had several interactions with the buyer.  In December 2021 i received notification from ebay that a dispute had been raised on the item by the buyers payment service (Google pay in this instance).  Effectively, the buyer had said the item did not match the description.  I called ebay and asked what evidence was provided for this dispute and they could only tell me that the item did not match the description.  I contacted the buyer but go no response.  When a dispute like this is raised you are allowed to upload one photo as evidence to the contrary.  You cannot write anything and you have no interaction with anyone.  Two months later I was told that the dispute had been upheld and I owed the buyer the £500 which ebay would take from my account as they had already paid it to Google pay.  the final decision on the dispute said my item would be returned if possible.  Surprise surprise, my item has not been returned.  I have basically been subjected to a fraudulent claim by the buyer and there is very little I can do about it.  I have thought about contacting the Police but the buyer has my address and I don't know this person. Needless to say I cannot ever trust ebay again and have closed my account.  When i spoke to ebay they just kept saying it was beyond their control and that yes more evidence should have been provided by the buyer but there was nothing they could do.",GB

I left a negative feedback. This guy begged me for a revision and I wanted to get some partial credit back instead since he denied the return initially and I didn't even have a printer to print out the return label even if I got one from him this time, plus too much time would be wasted for a low value item even if I manage to get a physical return label. I wanted him to refund me first then I would change the feedback as he lied about the item condition first. It was nothing wrong, I just want to get compensated for an item which didn't live up to the description and save my time and protected me from getting scammed the second time. He then refused to refund me, just like I suspected. This lowlife then reported me for asking for partial credit and ebay was on his side and banned me. If it was inacceptable, why even have that option to settle a return request by offering partial credit in seller's hub?

They use Dynamic IP address cookies & place small images on your browser pages to track literally everything you do, even when you're not using eBay. I found this out from a security expert who works for eBay. To be clear, your privacy (or lack of) is practically non existent whilst you're an eBay customer. I used to sell Macs & other electronic goods through them, they then suddenly one day decided that I had abused their returns procedures and banned me. Bear in mind, I have been with them since 2008. I'm not here to say i'm upset re: being banned, i'm simply letting you all know my experence with eBay so you can make an informed decision yourself. Re: the Ban; It's certainly not my fault if their courier/ postage centre keeps damaging items I have paid for. Their postage centre & couriers they use should be subject to review of their processes to ensure items do not turn up broken. Simple. That aside, this wasn't the only issue I faced with eBay. I was subjected to credit card fraud on eBay which I believe is unacceptable with all the security procedures these businesses should have in place today. A load of items turned up at my parent's house one day where my credit card took a pounding too. Thankfully my card issuer was able to assist with the transactions in question, though after this experience I don't think I would use eBay again having been with them since I was 18 years old (i'm now 32). To close my account over issues which were out of my control is just abhorrent & quie frankly, an insult at best. As a previous large shareholder in eBay at one stage, I can tell you that this is not the sort of company I wish to associate myself with. As for eBay themselves, and after having the experience of lifetime with them, and then some.. To round this short review up, I really can't recommend eBay. Yes the shareholder yields were good but the un-ethical business practices they have in place such as this experience I had, is just not me and I simply can't associate myself with a company like this. Please don't let this review be the ultimate decision maker of what you think of eBay. This was just my experience and perhaps yours will be better than the one I have had over the past 13 years with them.. Whatever you chose to do, good luck, and remember.. There may be trouble ahead... But while there's moonlight And music and love and romance Let's face the music and dance… No i'm not completely nuts (yet) but it's a good lyric which sums up eBay perfectly. P.s. I see a lot of people reviewing eBay in the ""excellent"" category stating that eBay side with the seller if you are in the right.. as a member of eBay for over 12 years, I can tell you from personal experience, I totally disagree with that statement entirely.",GB

There is a seller name maxain_0 who I believe stole my money. Before I bought the dress I could see pictures of dress , the stock photo and actual pics of the physical dress. I sent an offer and seller accepted then I paid for the dress. I noticed that after I paid whenever I went to go click on the listing the actual physical pics and stock pics of the dress could not be seen. I could only see the stock photo if I went to purchase history but if I went back to original listing nothing could be seen. I found that pretty strange, message the seller about it but the seller never gave me a reason as to why that was happening. When I go back to my other orders and click on them , I can see the stock photos and actual photos of actual item. Fast forward a week…still the seller hasn’t shipped the dress, I’m messaging the seller daily but no response. I still can’t see the listing. I’m asking the seller to refund me no response. I just can’t believe people sometimes, the seller was responsive before I bought the dress. But as a soon as I bought the dress the seller disappeared with my money. I went to ebay to get my refund, the page that is used to refund an item “ not received” isn’t working and still isn’t working til this day.  But the page used to refund item not received was working perfectly fine before march 5 and I had to give the seller until march 5 to ship the dress. March 5 passed so I logged onto ebay to get refund and page  was not working. This whole thing is so shady and ebay is of no help. This seller essentially took my money, didn’t ship the dress and won’t respond to my messages. I’m glad I paid with pay pal so at least I can get my money back that way. Ebay is not to be trusted, make sure the seller you’re buying from  has good selling reviews, don’t buy from seller who haven’t sold anything before.

You are the king, you can open a case and even if you have received the item with tracking proof customer care is going to support you either way and give you the refund and lets you keep the item as well not giving any chance to the seller to defend himself. As a seller you have no rights at all. You have to play by the rules. Deliver them item in and on time. A delay in customs or post office? this is not an excuse for ebay customer care. When buyer contacts customer support ebay will give the buyer whatever he wants,even if there is tracking number and item is on its way ebay customer care will be always in buyer's side even if that's not fair at all. My final review about Scambay! As a buyer as I have said before you can buy item and after a month you will open a request and you will receive refund and the delivered item too. As a seller do not bother and do not hear anyone on youtube who says that makes thousands $$$ on ebay giving you hopes and dreams, don't have hopes and dreams by selling on ebay, fees are very high plus taxes, dropshipping models do not work as well. You're gonna lose time and money and personal health from all the anxiety. I do not wish even to my worst enemy to sell on ebay. All in all!

No way we wrap with pro grade bubblewrap & take pics of packed items. He refused to send photo of broken item to me, as well as eBay when they requested pics to prove it was broken. I do not give refunds until proof of damage is received. He also refused to turn the ""supposedly"" broken item over to the USPS after I filed a damaged item case with them.  7/13/21 Ebay agent Rid said ""do not send buyer a return label until we hear from him"". Next thing I know ebay closed the case in his favor. I called & agent said the buyer never responded to them & because I did not send a return label they let him keep my item & he got his money back. What!? You told me not to send a label until you heard from him. I provided USPS with all documents & pic of my listing & since I could not get the item for them to investigate the buyers fraud, they too did nothing. For several months I refiled for reconsideration with USPS several times and provided info I had, which included the buyers and my communications, copy of transaction, pics of item sent etc. It didn't matter to Ebay or USPS that the buyer refused to provide proof the item was actually broken. So Bob not only got to keep a perfect vintage compote bowl, he got his money back.  I ended up over $100 in the hole. 2) bought a pair of jeans listed as Fashion Bug ""Womens size 4"".  Then my father was in a horrific auto accident & I did a bedside vigil until he passed weeks later.  With all that was going on I forgot to open the pkg until 31 days after it was delivered. I rec'd a ""Juniors size 4"" jeans.  I asked buyer if I could return jeans since it was her error, she said yes. I opened a return case & never rec'd a return label.  Return process msg from eBay, which I ck'd every day and the return process page said said ""You have requested a return, we will contact you once we hear from the seller, case is open until 2/14/22.""  I kept the case open waiting for the return label that never came.  Ebay closed the case 2/15/22. I never got a refund, so I called ebay and they said I had 30 days to file for a return & you requested a return at 31 days. I said the seller approved the return & you, ebay allowed me to process the return, but now that its closed you say I only had 30 days, but when I requested the return never once did Ebay send me any notice that I only had 30 days to file. I explained that my father was in a horrific auto accident, I had used my credit card & now I have to file for a refund through them. 3) I have bought several items off ebay where in the title and description sellers use thecbrand name of products. But you receive shoddy knock offs & when I filed a fraud claim on Ebay, 6 months later the sellers are still selling the knock off items on eBay & are still using the brand name in their listings.  This is why I am moving my listings to Craigslist & Offerup with local pick up, there are no seller fees!  I will shop there too.",US

I don’t sell often just the odd thing probably once or twice a year.  Firstly the fees, I think it’s shocking that eBay consider your postage fee which you pay as profit and charge their percentage not only on your items but also your postage.  Secondly their returns policy. Even if you state you don’t accept returns, tough you will be forced to. EBay give all buyers 30 days to request a return and all they have to do is state that the item isn’t as described. This amount of time is ridiculous, for anyone not trying to scam a seller if you received an item that you thought wasn’t as described then you would request a return within a matter of days, even if you were busy/working/whatever it may be, it would not take you 30 days. This 30 days basically allows buyers to use items, or wear them and when they no longer want them or have damaged them inside that 30 days they can just send them back with a full refund. You can not refuse the refund or anything it’s eBay policy. When you then get your item back, and it’s worn, or damaged, or not in the condition you sent it in, guess what you can do nothing about it. EBay will just let you leave the buyer a bad review.  I sold a pair of genuine designer boot, they were never worn and had been sat in the wardrobe in a box for years. I got the refund request 3 weeks after the buyer received the items, I questioned it with no help from eBay other than tough you have to accept the return and refund the buyer. What I received back were boots that looked like they’d been taken on a cross country run. I even questioned if these were the original boots I sent. I sent photographs to eBay and even a clip of me opening them from the post. I got told that I couldn’t get part of the money back as the item was returned to me and all I could do was leave a review and eBay would review the buyers account.

(she's never used eBay her whole life) I am 99.9% positive eBay thinks that she is trying to scam people with ""designer"" bags when in reality, goodwill -> purchase -> research -> sell for profit. Guess she is considered scamming when trying to sell puzzles and clothes and other items... at least now we have a good reason to make a website for the business or sell on platforms that are much better with support and no fees. Seriously eBay get your customer support in check and get your business model in check. 1.2 stars is actually a lot higher than what I was expecting this platform to have. If you're thinking this is great and amazing, you're in for a rough ride when eBay bans you for something they ""think"" is a good reason, and then do not proceed to tell you the reason why or let you speak with higher-ups to determine the solution. Even without breaking any TOS, they seem to not care so guess what neither do we. All it is, is a ticking time bomb, read through the reviews on here, how many people are actually satisfied? Why is this old outdated platform even still around when they can do this to new customers who try to buy or sell? I personally have used eBay since I was 7, selling items and games on my own that I got bored playing with as a kid, never got banned, and never had any problems. This problem doesn't even personally affect me since it isn't my account, but I will no longer ever use the platform and all their competitors are miles ahead of what they will ever be doing. Seriously, the first step in running a successful business is to value your customers and clients, something eBay has no accountability for clearly. Also, I have had instances where I have been ""scammed"" on eBay myself, left a bad seller review, and nothing was done, the accounts are still selling to this day I'm sure. This to me as a technical person shows incompetence at a corporate level in the business model. Everybody looking to make money selling items should try selling them locally or even with their competitors first such as grailed or honestly anything else. eBay takes their cut and all that's cool, but if they do that and then ban your account, I feel like the company is just scamming you. Try selling locally with no fees so these corporate goodies don't get a kickback from your hard work and dedication to building a reputable platform. You'll probably be happier and less stressed anyways and won't have to deal with incompetent people.",US

Finally I found a way to contact ebay's chat support, where one of their representatives misled me by saying my account would be reinstated after I told them the entire story. It was reinstated for a few hours, then suspended again. Here's what happened: My account was created in 2012, while I was living in Brazil. I had a PayPal account associated and everything was fine. I've since moved to another 3 countries, and everything was OK. However, eBay has decided recently to stop their partnership with PayPal (for whatever reason, it's not relevant) and decided to use Payoneer, which is a horrible company (which I also had problems with and will post about). I created my Payoneer account, and it required my tax residence - Luxembourg, my current location. I associated this account to my eBay account, and boom - it suddenly got suspended. Their latest update was that my account failed the ""KYC validation"", because apparently an account created in Brazil cannot be associated to a tax residence somewhere else. I've tried reasoning with them, but it seems way too difficult for a company of this size to understand how tax residence works.

The first line agents can not make decisions because they are outsourced somewhere overseas where service is not a priority.  I had been a seller since 2006, just small, I was a much bigger buyer.  I never presented an issue from the buying side and would work with the vendor directly if I had an issue.  eBay suspended my account when 2 shipments were held up during holidays.  The items were delivered but they refunded the buyer even with post office tracking entered in system.  So essentially these buyers received free items because eBay never reimbursed me.  They also refused to lift the hold unless I sent a copy of my drivers license, recent utility bill and bank statement - I am not joking on this, I was furious they would ask for these items before they would agree to lift the suspension.  It made zero sense.  I pay for a store and they have collected tons of fees from me and I have received nothing in return.  10 years ago they were still a good place to sell and they were pleasant to interact with, those days are long gone.  I would advise anyone considering their platform - do not, just do not.",US
1710,www.ebay.com,2022-01-26T17:51:43.000Z,1,eBay+ Lost of Integrity= eBait,"My review, and experience with eBay buying a watch. In my opinion, eBay is a corrupt platform. EBay creates rules, and policies for others to follow, but in return they break their own policies. Like most dictators they are liars. You cannot trust them; eBay says they will do one thing, and in return they do something different, especially if they think you are no longer watching them!!! I won an item for over 13K, it was towards the end of the auction, the bid was at $11K wasn’t a problem because I had the money, and I didn’t think it would go to $13K. However; it did so at the end of the auction I reach out to the seller and explained to them that I was uploading funds from my bank account to pay for the item because eBay don’t allow split payments, keep in mind this is after I won the item and tried to pay using what I had available at the time which was 12K on a credit card and had the rest in my bank account. The auction never stated payment must be completed within a certain time, plus eBay gives you 4 calendar days to pay for an item as to there own policy, but I only was given less than an hour. I just wanted to pay the seller quickly!!! However, even though I contact the seller within an hour, explaining to them I was uploading additional funds to complete the transaction the seller canceled the transaction, seller gave me no other option not even 24 hours to pay for the item, which I won fair and square. Also, please keep in mind, and most cases even certain dealers need time before cashing you out on a sell of an item over 13K, I have waited to get paid a full day from watch dealers over time, that’s just how it goes, everything isn't in a straight line all the time I understand that. Anyway, I reach out to eBay. eBay told me to leave the seller feedback, and document what happen to me, so I did,  and then later eBay removed the feedback they told me to write!!!! LOL EBay is a joke!!! Now, whenever, I can contact a seller to by pass them I’m doing it and using PayPal to pay, or my credit card, I’m fed-up with this dictator system and their lies!!! We the people need better options and eBay needs to be boycotted if these kinds of behaviors continue!!!!! ""They lie, they cheat, they do whatever it takes, to control the world around you!!!!""

The site is so complicated - I would not know where to start.  I told the seller to keep his darn money - it is not worth my time.

When through the hassle of getting all the tracking and eBay keeps asking me to upload them manually, but some of them couldn't be uploaded due to a system glitch. eBay did nothing and replies back like a robot repeating the same stuff over and over again. At the same time, they will steal money from your account through subscriptions and the funds you earned. Don't sell on ebay, or you will lose your money. And don't buy on eBay either. A tracking can be faked for example and eBay does nothing to protect the buyer. This is ShitBay If I could give zero, I would. eBay is the worst company in the world.",DK

1759,www.ebay.com,2022-01-18T18:45:35.000Z,1,Milked for interest?,"In October of 2021 I sold nearly $20,000 worth of merchandise on eBay. It is now nearing the end of January 2022 and I still don't have access to my money. Long story short, there was an ""internal problem"" which kept me from replacing my old bank account (which refused to link to eBay for reasons that are becoming obvious) with a new one. I was asked dozens of times to ""just run through the process"" of adding a new bank account, which would inevitably end with someone telling me that ""there is an internal problem"" and that ""someone will contact me within 72 hours"". No one ever contacted me on any of these occasions. I guess they're milking my account for interest? I have to pay taxes on this money now and I still don't have access to it. Today, I was on hold for over an hour before they hung up. I called back mad and said I'd give them one more shot before I involved a lawyer, and... Magic! Within literally fifteen minutes they found someone to remove the old bank account so that I can begin the process of adding a new one. The absolute dumbest part is that I would've happy to sell more stuff on eBay for the convenience even though they take a fat cut. But now it's clear they don't want me as a seller. Stay far, far away.",US

1762,www.ebay.com,2022-01-18T09:16:43.000Z,1,I have been an eBay customer for…,"I have been an eBay customer for several years  and have purchased dozens of items. I have been overall pleased with the quality of the items and haven’t had any problems outside of purchasing some spark plugs for my car that didn’t fit. I returned those plugs for a refund.  My problems started when I decided to try to sell a few items I had laying around my home. I started with a Filson garment bag that retailed for $795.00 and was in new condition, just sitting in my closet unused. I jumped through all the hoops of setting up my account to sell and listed the item for sale on their site. I listed the item for $545.00 which I felt was in line with some similar filson bags that were on their site. Within about a week I got an offer of $400.00 from a buyer in Alabama. I countered the offer at $450.00 which he accepted. I then shipped the item to the seller using the label provided by eBay. After about two weeks, the money was credited to my bank account which came to 388.00 after the deducted expenses by eBay.  I thought I was done with this transaction but boy was I wrong! I was then notified by eBay in a message on my account that the seller had filed a claim saying that he didn’t receive the item. I immediately felt that this was a scam and notified ebays customer service as to my feelings. I also provided them the tracking number which showed that the item was delivered to the post office in the sellers home town. I was assured by eBays customer service agent that I would be fully protected and to call back in a week so that they could close the case in my favor. In a week, I called back eBay and they closed the case in my favor. So I thought that this was finalized and I wouldn’t have to worry about it any further. Boy was I wrong! I was then notified by a message from eBay that they had reversed there decision and now I would not only have to repay the $388.00 back but also ebays fee for a grand total of $450.00 So not only was I losing the bag, which had a retail value of $795.00 but I was going to have to fork out the ebay fee in addition. So another words, eBay would still of course make money on the transaction and the seller would end up with a beautiful bag plus get all his money back! I would not only lose the bag in the deal but would have to pay back more money than I even received! I could not live with this so I decided to put a stop payment against eBay on the checking account and removed my credit cards so eBay could not debit them for this amount. I was then threatened by eBay that if I didn’t pay them back that my account would be restricted. I told them to go ahead and restrict my account if they felt I did something wrong which they did.  I feel that there should be some protections to the seller. However, eBay I’ve since learned rarely rules against the buyer because of there money back guarantee. So you have cases where people claim that they didn’t receive a package or some other flakey reason and eBay sides with them. There needs to be some protections given to the seller, especially when they can provide a tracking number.  I will miss purchasing items off the eBay site and perusing thru there products but I am not going to repay eBay when I feel I didn’t do anything wrong.",US

No big deal, we gave them our required private information (banking, id etc). 3 days later they send us a message that we were permanently suspended from the platform. Which means our business account and all our personal accounts attached to it are frozen/banned. I contacted them and they said that the suspension cannot be reversed, nor can they tell us why they suspended us. Also, they stated that we will never be able to sell or buy from any newly created accounts (or they will have restrictions). All we did was 1. Create an account 2. Jump through their verification hoops and 3. Get banned. Waste of time! We are all shocked and appalled by this process.

They again responded with a reply that it is in the best interest they part ways with me. They claim safety for the community is their main concern.  What a joke, if this were true they would want to help me figure out what happened and by who.  They also went on to say that if I try to open any future accounts they will be blocked immediately.  I demanded that they delete my account.  Their response was they can not close suspended or blocked accounts.  Terrible company! Their practices and customer service are the bottom of the barrel.

I thought it must be some kind of scam, this could not be how e-bay conducts its business.. Sadly I was wrong, the account is blocked and despite numerous attempts we have heard nothing from e-bay. This has had an adverse effect on our start up as our sales are all online. We are able to supply the information requested if given the opportunity to do so via a working link.

I have now submitted documentation twice, still no resolution and my last reply from ebay was an unreadable email in all html. Additionally, the original $500+ order that was made, which left me with a GC balance (still frozen), is lost with UPS freight. I can not really lay that at the feet of ebay or the seller, but it reflects poorly anyway. **Original** I made a purchase using ebay gift cards and had a small balance ~$41 left on one. I went to make another purchase and checked the radio button to apply that remaining balance, it didn't take. I ended up on chat support and was told it had been frozen and a request would be submitted to unfreeze it, wait 48-72 hrs and it would be available. Now that card shows $0 balance and chat tells me I need to submit photos of GC along with receipts of purchase to be reviewed by GC team to unfreeze the balance. Why is ecommerce getting so bad with all of these systems? I think it is a machinery run amok, just eating consumers alive. I hope to receive my first purchase and then will close my ebay account and chalk up the unused balance to a lesson learned -- IT IS TIME to disengage from ecommerce altogether!",US

No employee told me I would be charged 179.  They took my ebay label for $98 and shipped it.  Now ebay took out 179 on Christmas day from mybank account. I have spent hours on the phone wasting my time with ebay blaming fedex and fedex blaming ebay. If the two corporations do not have it together to take care of customers, they are clearly engaging in bank fraud due to overcharging and corporate neglect.

Yes melted away into droplets!! It burned my hand and damaged my hob. Needless to say I immediately asked for a refund and most importantly, for the item to be removed from selling due to health and safety. This chip pan is so dangerous and there could have been a lot more damage had I not acted swiftly. I sent photos of the damage done to both my unit and hand. Seller REFUSED a refund on the basis that the item was used after 14 days!!! I went through eBay and opened up a case. eBay customer service was very sympathetic and assured me the item would be removed immediately and a refund would be issued…It would never happen! Phone call after phone call,each time the assistant would reassure me that it would be sorted. I’ve asked to speak to manager after manager, every time a new version of events and apologies. I eventually left negative feedback on the sellers page which was honest and very needed to warn others. Well eBay removed the feedback!!! Without giving me a reason. Here we are a year and a half later and the chip pan is still on for sale and I still haven’t got my refund.

No one cares, no one knows what they are doing and most importantly no one can fix anything or is prepared to. Lie after lie and excuses. The representatives put you on hold to read off a screen as they have no clue to how to fix problems. Nothing is followed up or taken seriously.

Then this managed payments came in. What a shambles. Money takes 4 days from payment to clear into your bank account in which time the item is posted etc so from the get go you are spending money you don’t have.  Now that is a pain but my reason for leaving eBay altogether is a different kettle of fish.  I recently sold 2 lots of the same item, army uniform, to a chap with a Japanese surname.  The item was posted strangely to an address in Southampton but hey ho each to their own.35 days after the sale I received an email from eBay saying my funds were on hold.  The buyer had stated my item was damaged. Hmmm I thought. That’s rubbish as they were all (4 jackets) all brand new.  So stressing that £230 of my cash was now on hold I asked the buyer for some pictures of the damage. Needless to say, no reply. Next step was to call eBay. Oh my days why a total shower.  Apparently the buyer had gone via their ‘FINANCIAL INSTITUTION’ to raise the claim. Presumably as the eBay protection period had ended. Ebay told me to dispute the claim which I did.  Only one solitary picture of evidence is allowed. So that was provided. Still no email from the buyer as to what the damage was. 2 weeks passed and still nothing, money still on hold.  Repeated calls to eBay were made with each assistant giving a different version of events and what I’m to do.Then one of the assistants told me it was PayPal that had raised the cases. So here we go, I spoke to PayPal. They had no recollection of the cases being raised and stated it was ebays managed payments that were raising the cases and that no communication from eBay had been received. So back on the phone I went to eBay. It was safe to say they had absolutely no idea what was going on.  Three weeks in and in still waiting for a resolution. Apparently it can take up to 90 days.  Cutting a long story short the Moral of this tale is that it’s safe to say that sellers have absolutely no protection from buyers any longer at all.  I fully expect to loose my money and my items (which have probably been sold on already) and all to a scammer in some foreign land. A faceless person who chances his arm and raised a bogus claim knowing fine well eBay won’t stick up for the seller. Needless to say I won’t be using eBay any longer and I strongly advise people now to NEVER EVER EVER sell via eBay. Such a shame as it was good once but like everything it’s a victim of its own success, offers terrible customer service to sellers and just wants to have your money come what may.

He decided to file a claim and long story short the items were returned to me. Myself having to pay all shipping expenses. Lost around 120$ in shipping costs. After a few days of trying to fight the claim my account was suspended and they tell me its because I'm not 18 when I am in fact 18. I tried to explain this to the support agents but they just blow me off and end the conversation before I can explain myself. I have always hated eBay but it was the best platform to sell on at the time. Bad navigation, old design, is not keeping up with the times, and last but not least BAD policies and support.

The last return Ebay was giving me a hard time including one Ebay rep who told me free shipping and handling is against Ebay policy unless not as described even though Ebay has been doing it for me for the last one or two years.  After three or four times contacting them I was told someone would be contacting me a couple days later about a refund for shipping and handling.  I check my email a couple hours later and Ebay had sent a message a half hour after the conversation that my account has been permanently suspended because my pattern of behavior is a security threat to members of Ebay and its community and this is after each time calling them being thanked for being a loyal member of Ebay for the last 17 years.  They won't tell me what I did wrong.  Was it something that I said?  Won't tell me.  Was it something that I did?  Won't tell me.  Their excuse is it is for security reasons.  I think I know why they suspended my account.  They were losing too much money on shipping and handling and this is their way to permanently get rid of me.  I would add that I work for the government and I think I know a thing or two about security.

The only reason I don't give one star is that, when it works, it is a pleasure to work with and I can get good deals, but it is disrespectful of its customer's time. When I tried to log in, I was confronted with an hCatpcha children's picture game that asked me to identify motorcycles in images that, in some cases, looked like a child's finger painting. It kept presenting me with more challenges and then told me there were too many attempts from my computer.  It turns out, and I will be informing as many people as possible, that this is an apparent intentional misuse of user time not for security purposes but to use their unpaid work as ""data serfs"" (the article title is ""Don't give it away, give it away, give it away now, bot busting biz tells reCAPTCHA data serfs"" I don't think Trustpilot allows links) and hCaptcha itself says "" When you use hCaptcha, companies bid on the work your users do as they prove their humanity. You get the rewards."" I do not budget time to play children's picture games to use a web site and, if I cannot bypass hCaptcha with a utility like Buster, this will simply send me to competing web sites. The bottom line is that, if you want people to work to train image recognition systems, you need to pay them through, for example, Mechanical Turk.   If Ebay was not still useful to me I would discontinue doing business with it entirely, and I may still do so if this continues to be a problem.

You don't go into any store and walk out with any item saying they will collect your money in 21 days and that includes all online aution/selling/buying sites.  They got a new CEO Jamie Lannone who is now running Ebay just for profit and Congress should be looking into ethics charges again him.  I had a rep actually tell me, when asked, that she can't give out who is Ebay's CEO.  Can you image a paid employee saying something like that.  It starts at the top and Jamie Lannone should step down before Ebay starts loosing money.  He needs to resign and Congress should investigate how they are holding people's money, which is basically stealing.  A buyer can make a false claim and you can lose your money.",US

After shopping I got to the hotel, the hotel front desk looked through the packages and non was there for me ….. at this moment I came confused between the mailman and hotel front desk, days passed no iPhone 12 Pro Max package, I contacted eBay.com to open an investigation, then I contacted the USPS.com call centers both eBay.com and usps concluded their investigations that the item was delivered and case closed.

In fact, someone did this chronically on Amazon and was arrested for it per a Google article. When we received back the fake item that looked nothing like the originally shipped item we contacted eBay. eBay indicated that normally they would side with the purchaser. However, due to our impeccable record, while they did not investigate the buyer they did not deduct the amount from our account. It may seem like there was not a loss on our side. However, it really feels wrong that a company like eBay would not take further action to investigate someone who would blatantly do this with the intent of taking advantage of the sellers. We were recommended by eBay to join a forum to discuss this and people were not sympathetic to the situation. I suppose it has to happen to you for you to understand how it feels, especially when you takes a lot of pride in every single one of your sales transactions providing the best possible service to any buyer, every single time.

I get an offer for 97 and I accept, bare in mind they are going for around 200 in auctions. I admit I chose the wrong shipping fees so I ended up losing a little bit on that but this is where it gets good. I shipped the item 2 days after it was purchased and used parcel force at the post office paying for express 48. They try to deliver and the customer isn’t home so they took it to the Depo and waiting for the receiver to pick up. Normal so far. Then the buyer tells me her no longer wants it, I tell him it’s already been sent and I don’t accept returns unless damaged or not working. I call parcelforce and ask them to reattempt delivery of which they do successfully. deliver.  Customer then sends me pics saying it’s damaged and won’t work if which I reply well you need to speak to parcel force and he did and they say they dropped it. Customers then issues a return with eBay. Bare in mind I only received 77 pound for this because eBay took their fees. So I call eBay and they said I have to wait 4 days whilst this is been looked at. So I wait. After the 4 days I’m told he can keep the fridge and I still have e to send him a refund of 97 pound. So he gets a free fridge and my money and eBay has their fees. I can’t parcel force and they say any compensation is only paid within the month it was sent but it’s took this long to get to this stage.

All I can say is just wow. I had no idea there is so little protection for the sellers on the site. For example, i sold a very nice watch to someone in NY. They contacted me letting me know that the box it came in was damaged  and were requesting a 80% refund of what they paid. When I informed that i didn't use a box it was a double bubble envelop. She accused me of playing games and left a negative feedback. I contacted customer service explained to them what happened and even showed them a video of me packing it (that was a standard practice back then as I thought that it would help protect me, it didn't). To this day the feedback is still on the account before they closed it.  Yeah about that, it was such a negative experience i got a IRL job and stopped selling. I gave it a few years then my wife wanted to unload some  squishmallows we still had from way back when.  The problem  is that I lost access to the email that my ebay account was associated with so we went on the app and changed the address.  She got about 6 buy it now auctions running when we got a notification that the account has been closed due to a violation of their terms of service. It also mentioned that they sent a detailed reason to the email on file and if we want to dispute it to click the link provided. Well the issue with that is that it went to the original email and not the changed one . I tried to contact customer service and they honestly could care less and that was that. An account that had well over 1000 positive reviews on it. I have had for years (since before they required a credit card to open an account), I was a member from the very early days of the site and just like that it was all gone within seconds and to this day I still do not have a clue as to why.

They con people into giving fake good reviews, or buying counterfeit items,  or just practice repetitive unethical tricks such as - never sending the order, sending empty boxes filled with popcorn  packing, repetitively sending orders to different states, selling items that are not clean, selling items such as shampoo but replacing it with water, sending items thru problematic shipping companies who don't  deliver  properly, or don't  have someone sign for an order, or sends broken merchandise  that was falsely advertised new, sending counterfeit  items, refusing to refund money when you don't  get what you paid for, and worse.

Their customer service isn’t worth contacting , they have zero power too do anything. Now don’t take that as a complaint against the actual workers that work for ebay it is not their fault. It is 100 percent the fault of the people in charge. I used ebay since it first came out off and on, when it use to be a good way to sell your used things quickly. Now ebay is so greedy it’s insane and gives you nothing in return. They do shady things like hold items from view for days, make you pay over 10 percent to ebay, plus they want you to pay them for advertising, so you could pay a lot if you weren’t paying attention. They also encourage slow shipping and bad service. I shipped out my item 2 day over night, the person got it and was happy enough to leave feedback the item was fine. Ebay won’t release the money. They use to, every transaction I’ve ever made on ebay I would ship fast, after feed back pay pal would release the funds that day or latest 24 hours. With ebay in full control of your money they won’t release it for 14 days. The only reason for this would be because they steal your money for 14 days invest it some where, and as long as they get it back in 14 days which is guaranteed because they control the money, they make lots of profit. So I would of got my money the same time if I sent it low end usps or 1 day. It’s probably why every item on ebay is shipped super slow with the horrid usps, which may or may not get your mail to you. So all ebay turned into is a greed fest of corporate evil, with people over charging because they have to give ebay 12 to 20 percent, plus pay the government 8 to 10 percent, all while the average sucker like me suffers because I can’t compete with any of that drivel, nor would I want to.

Recently I have been threatened as a seller due to my bad performance related to canceled or returned items which only number 2%.... however much of this was not my own fault ...some due to bad buyers changing their minds an some were due to Ebay listing some of my items as multiples when I only had one.... imagine my surprise to find their feedback on Trustpilot which is much worse than mines.Hence I will reduce what I put onto Ebay and find alternative avenues and I suggest other do the same .

I tried to work through the returns process, where I was in contact with the buyer trying to ascertain the reason for them saying the item was faulty. This communication was going nowhere as my buyer was being really evasive about the fault and I had suspicions that they had just changed their mind, which is not a reason for a return. I decided to contact eBay to see if they could clarify where I stood on the matter. I must say the process of contacting eBay over the phone was 'exceptional' the level of customer service was second to none. All I did was to go to the contact section and request a call back from eBay and within a minute a charming person with and Irish accent called me and we discussed the  claim. Nothing was too much trouble, she went through all the emails from my customer and myself and within a few minutes she had worked through the claim and had it resolved!!! I felt totally at ease and she explained very clearly everything that she was going to do and even reset some parameters on my account to stop any future episodes.    I don't often leave reviews but I cannot praise the experience I had highly enough. Lovely to hear clearly spoken, charming, helpful people on the end of a call.

So Ebay gets to keep our 1400.00 US , and they have no intention of giving it to us, of course they say provide proof you live in the USA , which they have always known we are in Canada. Every one of our listings in larger letters state : WE LIVE IN CANADA BUT SHIP FROM USA "" We shipped all those items out so we are also out the merrchandise. Ebay says they can't fix it, yet I have a transcript saying if we open a Ebay account in Canada , they would transfer the funds to the Ebay.ca account. So did that and now told no we can't do that. I have been pleasant with everyone of these so called Ebay workers as I know it is not their fault, and they probably deal with this crap all day long. Any lawyers out there that see a case in this  , to view our Ebay go to scavengers on Ebay.com. You have to wonder why Ebay  would need to keep 1400.00 US of money that is not theirs, maybe having a tough time with so many people that have quit using Ebay. If I am wrong on any of this Ebay managers, please give your side , we know you won't because you hope this will just go unnoticed , but I will contact news papers and any other body that will listen. You have gone too far, even though I asked if I should cancel our last auctions , I was told NO , as we had not received a date to update account yet, so she would put a note on our account saying we would change to Ebay.ca as soon as these auctions were over.

I said to them why you don’t write with capital letters before me accepting the offer so I can be aware. No answer on that ( of course no answer as no one will accept to pay that money if they see it when the offer is coming) It was first time and the last time I will use them.

(we sell bespoke products that cannot be returned) I have tried to close my account on numerous occasions.  Firstly I couldn't close my account because I owed £2.38. Having managed to scrape together the money to pay them I then couldn't close my account within 30 days of making a payment? Given that I appear to incur fees whether or not I list anything for sale this would appear to give me 7 potential days in a year to close my account.  So the current situation is that I don't owe them any money, I don't have any subscriptions (whatever they might be?) I don't have any items for sale but I can't close my account because it's been suspended for some unspecified reason.  There are limited ways to contact eBay, you can contact them online but it seems only if your reason for contacting them is already on a very small list of queries they would be happy to deal with.  When I was in debt to them for £2.38 I received an increasing number of ever more threatening emails culminating in them threatening to set debt collectors on me.  While my subscription is pennies every month, (my time writing this review will have cost about 5 years worth) presumably if you are as big as eBay it pays them to lock thousands of companies/people into paying pennies every month rather than allowing them to leave.

I almost had no issues listing items like Prada sandals and even some Louis Vuitton bags, but for some strange reason eBay decided that items like a Louis Vuitton belt with a clearly visible serial code are counterfeits and immediately removed them as soon as they're up, despite including photos that proved they're authentic! I ended up using another platform to sell the removed items, and if I remember correctly, the LV belt got sold within days and I received positive feedback from the buyer :) But just recently, I stupidly decided to list some Chanel items on eBay, including a pair of black sunglasses from my mom's friend and coworker. Most of the items are still up on eBay as of now, but days after being listed, *unsurprisingly* the black sunglasses got taken down! I believe the listings that got taken down right away were done automatically by bots, but I'm not really sure about the sunglasses. It's really freaking irritating, not just because it took them days to remove the sunglasses, but also because you can't go back to any of the (wrongfully) deleted listings to retrieve information like the item description, which sometimes take several minutes to write! I actually listed more sunglasses a couple days ago that were bought directly from Chanel's website, and after finding out about the deleted black sunglasses, I immediately went ahead and copy-pasted all of the necessary information and emailed them to myself, just in case something idiotic happens again! I don't understand how listings that are similar to my deleted ones (RIP) are still allowed to be up on eBay, but this whole counterfeit accusation thing is so ridiculous and I'm sick of it! The only good thing out of this that I can come up with is that eBay's going to lose a potentially huge chunk of profit from my sales, not that I think they deserve any of it ;)  I'm still using feeBay only because I find it to be a great place to sell nerdy stuff.

2050,www.ebay.com,2021-11-24T09:07:49.000Z,1,EBAY PAYMENTS SYSTEM,"I have always used ebay, but enough is enough. I have two user accounts for various selling and purchasing, my main account has been setup for many years without any issues, and last year by accident when I logged on using my Google it setup a new account, so decided to keep it and use the two accounts going forward. Anyway as I mentioned never been any problems until ebay brought in there new managed payments facility, the most frustrating and inefficient process known to man (its definitely not world beating, like something else we all know). Initially they want you to sell a number of items to confirm your a good seller before the funds are paid out within a couple of days of selling, which is fair enough and acceptable. With more than 30 sales under my belt, and all with positive feedback, ebay today have now again decided to hold monies for no good reason, The item has already been delivered, tracking is stating it was delivered, the tracking was provided on ebay at the time of sale, so I have done everything correctly. The buyer has left positive feedback too. Let me explain, the item was posted and arrived at the new owners home, therefore the postage cost I have born out of my own monies, The new owner is currently using my property, so in theory ebay hasn't completed the contract between the seller and the purchaser yet, therefore legally speaking the contract is still open, when in fact the goods are with the new owner. Firstly the item that I sold is worth £1,500 and the postage was £50.  Suddenly this looks really bad, ebay say they are going to hold funds for one month, again with no good reason. Therefore the sale contract between the seller and the buyer remains open, which basically means the seller as no protection at all, The buyer could turn around in 20 days and say they don't want it, and want to return it, the seller will have no choice but to agree, as they would have seen no monies yet, the contract is not complete, and ebay will always side with the buyer, as ebay are still holding your monies, the seller hasn't got a leg to stand on, you'll receive your item back, probably at your own cost and after its been used by someone else for 20 days.  Is this fair? Is this reasonable?  The answer is definitely not.  When PayPal managed the process it was much better managed, I have never experienced any unfair issues as a seller or as a buyer, it was very well balanced between the two. Now that ebay manage their own payments, it's very much weighted in the buyer's favour (I know as a buyer, its fantastic), so now it's not very pleasant selling in ebay as you don't know what to expect after you have sold. This is the second time this has occurred, ebay promised me this would never happen again after my initial 15 sales, they lied. Ebay need to listen, im a long time user of your platform, sellers are starting to get frustrated at your inefficient controls. Ebay needs both seller and buyers, so ebay needs to listen otherwise buyer's won't have anything to buy, as sellers will go elsewhere to sell and competitors will take your business as this will be an opportunity.",GB

This laptop was advertised as “new in open box.”  Upon receiving the laptop and opening the box, I found a Damaged/Defective sticker inside.  I contacted the seller who shared with me that they take apart computers to sell for parts, as well as repair computers.  However, they stated that the sticker got in the box by mistake and assured me that the laptop was new.  I then navigated to the computer manufacturer’s website and discovered that the warrantee on the laptop was activated in May, approximately five months prior to my purchase.  Therefore, the laptop I purchased was bought before I received it by someone else and is IN FACT A USED/REFURBISHED COMPUTER, NOT NEW!  I am guessing that the laptop in question was purchased back in May by another individual and for some reason was returned to the store where it got a Damaged/Defective sticker slapped on it.  Somehow the seller (abarelyinc) got ahold of the laptop, refurbished it and put it up on eBay for sale as new.   I subsequently wrote negative feedback for the seller regarding the purchase and posted it on eBay.  However, the seller contacted eBay and had the negative feedback removed.  I thought, this can’t be but I contacted eBay about the issue and NOW it can be.  It used to be that once feedback was it could not be changed or removed, but apparently eBay changed its policy so now sellers can have negative feedback removed.  As a result, eBay can protect its highest sellers while at the same time protect its profits at the expense of its consumers/buyers.  Buyers can no longer go to a seller’s feedback on eBay and get an honest review their selling practices.  The computer works fine, in fact I am using it to write this review but that is not the point.  I was not looking for a refurbished computer and would not have purchased the laptop from this seller had I been aware of this seller’s DECEPTIVE selling practices; and I paid more money for a NEW computer, not REBURBISHED, allowing eBay to increase its profits through higher sellers’ fees associated with the higher price of the used products. I have been a member of eBay in good standing for the last 20 years and have a feedback score approaching 1,000, both selling and buying.  However, I recently made a decision to longer sell on ebay due to its changing policies and increasing sellers’ fees.  Now I am very close to no longer buying on eBay, as well.  Before I make any purchases on eBay I always check the seller’s feedback.  If sellers’ have feedback removed that they do not like, then their feedback score is useless.  In my opinion, all this practice does is promote deceptive selling practices on eBay!!!!",US

I havto wait for 3 days after item is delivered just for me to receive my money. Etc. Anyways, Shipped an item to a buyer recently (auction) for well under retail of item. I get a message from buyer a couple days after it says it was delivered. That there’s all these crazy damages, and it looks like someone dropped it, big hole in back, frame doesn’t hold screen in place. I ask kindly for more pictures of claims but buyer avoided any requests I had. He sent me 2 pictures of what he wanted me to see, it was hard to even tell if the item he took pictures of was even the one I sent because it was literally zoomed in pictures of a single spot. But anyways ebay then notified me buyer requested a refund. And because I’m a new seller ebay will guarantee buyer gets full refund even if I have proof the claims made are false. I take a video of me cleaning and packing every item I sell, even if it’s a local sale. Again I ask buyer to provide full detailed pictures of items so I can compare them to my pictures an video. He send 1 more picture which shows the item a little better, but in this picture he sent I’m 100% sure it has been disassembled. Which is not how I sent it. (Also have proof of that) Same thing, no luck, avoiding my requests saying I’m harassing him and that I havto accept return or he’ll escalate….and at this point ebay has no way for me to give my side of the story. So what options do I have? eBay is holding my money, and If I ignore the request they will automatically refund anyways and quote “possibly even not require buyer to return item” which is such a scam. This platform is trash. I am very familiar with people who buy things off eBay, swap parts out for their parts, then send it back to seller asking for full refund. Leaving the seller with an item in worse condition or even non working condition then how it was sent. But ebay doesn’t care at all.",US

They never sent any funds for shipping and I was not paying international shipping. After waiting patiently I contacted eBay via chat.  They told me they closed my case and would issue a full refund by Nov 17-19th and I could discard the item.  I relied on this and discarded the item.

They never acknowledged this conversation, even after I again supplied it to them and proof I sent my PayPal information. eBay is continuing to support the sellers fraudulent Mia representation of fine jewelry and play a distraction game stating I must return the item because now all of a sudden that burden was on me.

I would in essence be throwing away over $240 when I was explicitly told and promised another outcome by both seller and eBay.

This is AFTER I specifically talked to their online support about whether eBay was one of those sites taking money while ensuring nothing gets sold, and was told 'no, no, eBay will only take a share of the actual sales.' No, no: eBay is actually trying to take money up front AND if you manage to make a sale, it will take a cut of that too.

This is why ebay has became scammer's favourite place. You can find decent price on ebay,  however when a price is really beyond what you expected, beware maybe it's because that seller wants to dig more money from you.

Since the change to eBay managed payments everything has changed for the worst my sales went from a respectable 2 - 3 items per day to 2 - 3 per month, yet after complaining to eBay, they still took my monthly payment and told me to optimize the listings more! Had the items viewing figures decreased gradually I could understand that, but it was as if someone had flipped a switch, suddenly no sales. eBay's response was ""it's just a selling trend"" This was followed by a selling restriction limiting the amount and value of the items I could list. After many phone calls, I was told there was nothing that could be done until the next account review when it would be increased LOL!  gues what? it never happened, I waited another month (still paying the monthly shop fee) nothing happen! Phone again several times and got the same answer ""it will change at the next review!"" still nothing I had the same restrictions. So after 14 years of their so-called loyalty, I will only use eBay (reluctantly) for auction items which is the format that eBay started with way back.

Two suggestions would be to revert back to PayPal for payment handling and charging £1 only for every item sold, a must simpler system that everyone can understand! Goodbye eBay",GB

They cheat people out of a great opportunity to make money by drop-shipping products to there 90 million customers.  For the first 90 days you're in business they keep the money received from your customers and make you purchase the products prior to sending them to the customer.  Once the customer receives the product and acknowledges receipt to Ebay, they will forward the money to you.  The problem is while they keep your money more orders are pouring in that you have to pay for out of pocket. If you don't have the capital to purchase the products, the customer loses out and loses faith in your store.  You must refund their money and they are not happy and neither are you!  I addressed this issue to Ebay in a letter to their Corporate Headquarters in San Francisco over a month ago and got no response.  Ebay is keeping the little guys with no money down and they are not practicing proper or even legal protocol when allowing a person to do drop-shipping.  I strongly urge anyone who is contemplating a drop shipping store to go elsewhere.  Unless you are rich and have an abundance of money to purchase products for your customers before you receive their money you will lose out in the end and Ebay will destroy you for not keeping up with their standards of store ownership. Ebay should follow the guidelines of every other drop shipping store.",US

No, I didn't sell much at all on ebay, but did buy quite a bit. I went to sell my vehicle on ebay motors, had it set for 7 days after the 3rd day ebay blocked and suspended my account. Why? What did I do? What was wrong? No clue, they just decided I was a risk to ebay. I followed all their guidelines for listing (I thought) I don't use profanity, It wasn't in all caps, I wasn't hiding anything about the vehicle, so? What was the issue? I don't know, they won't tell me, they claim its for the safety of the other members of ebay. Uhhhhh, ok? What was it? I'll never know, and, I'll find other avenues to sell. Oh well.

If a buyer files a request funds are on hold immediately even if the request is not justified at all. And in 99,9% of the cases Ebay sides with the buyer even if the seller did nothing wrong.

EBay said it would only cost $10 to ship the water heater and after I agreed to ship it to someone I found out they actually wanted $90 to ship it.  I talked to the customer about it and agreed to refund their money.  I refunded their money but the customer refused to believe me even after I showed them a screen shot of my bank account and pointed out where the money was withdrawn.  I ran into similar problems with the magazine's where it cost more to ship them then the price of the magazine and I couldn't figure out how to set it up to where the customer paid for the shipment and the magazine.  So I ended up canceling and refunding all those orders.  I stopped using EBay for 6 months because they also tried charging me an absurd hidden charge that didn't take into account any of the returns and refunded money.  I complained about it and their customer service agreed with me and refunded the money. I recently came back to try and sell some portraits Id painted on it only to find they had banned my account.

I see that you are already in good shape and I am joining the list. I naively believed that your long-standing presence on the market had allowed you to acquire that experience that others needed to become one of the giants of the web. And instead. A real disaster, saved (partially), as not rarely happens, by an operator of good will. Summary. I make a purchase as an unregistered user, which is allowed. And so far so good. But alas, I don't think ahead of time what might happen if you want to return the product. This becomes the case, and I find myself in utter chaos. To contact customer support you must be registered, (so, psss: no assistance on an order placed without registering !!! I must have lost this information!). I have an old account, but I don't remember the password. So will I be able to make an automatic change with confirmation via email? Well, no: to change the password you need to contact customer support (and already the situation is tangled). Only alternative provided: create a new account with the same email. Okay, let's do it. So, I enter, and I am forced to browse several routing pages (inappropriate in my case), to get a contact option: phone or chat. I can talk to someone on the phone, who unfortunately is unable to give me adequate and clear explanations to solve the problem. In the meantime, beyond the damage, the insult: I promptly received an email, in which I was warned that my account was ""permanently suspended"" (again, another contradiction) for ""suspicious traffic"" and to protect the ""community"" from potential damage. In the email it is specified that this decision CANNOT be appealed and that further reasons will NOT be provided. I found this way of communicating with a potential client: sheer madness. At this point, I have a pending return and an account that I can no longer access and I am furious. Great management! I call back the number in Milan through which I had spoken with the operator, and an answering machine answers me without any viable option. So, I go back to the web pages, through my login and try to follow a path that leads me to contact options. I get a chance to chat and I restart with the explanations to a new operator. I am very angry, I ask why my account has been closed and I am told that the ""Security Department"" will send me an email in 24 hours. I get the email that reiterates the exact same things: account suspended without specifying the reasons and without appeal. Probably, taking advantage of my open and explicit protests, I am contacted by an operator (and I would like to emphasize, of Albanian nationality, in the heart of all prejudices), who with patience and willingness to solve the problem, analyzes the situation in detail and guides me step by step towards the solution. Towards, the solution. Because it's not over. The lady sends me, via email, a page for changing the password. We login and follow a path to change the username, automatically assigned. We change the name and surname correctly (I had written them abbreviated) and delete many old logins with ""unconfirmed accounts"". The latter two are the concrete causes for the cancellation without appeal of a registered account (but see, then you can know and you can react, what a surprise!). Well, now there is the account. Let's move on. The operator gives me the number that identifies the product I want to return and the number of a second product ordered, also as an unregistered user (the order is in progress). The same person informs me that the return process has been activated and that I MUST wait for the seller's response. Today I receive an email containing the seller's response, asking me the reason for the return. Leaving aside at the moment that, by law, I would not be required to specify the reason, in the email I am asked, operationally, to click a link to reply and then, to access an account. But ... Tada: the account created is subsequent to the purchase made and I am not surprised that the result that appears is: ""technical problem"". So, I try to track down the assistance again, I get a contact via email (so I used all the possible media, the video call is missing ...) and I write that I can not take it anymore, and to let me have this damn etiquette return.

I have an electronics company and we sell thousands of items on eBay per year. Before Covid hit and even for about 6 months after, everything was good. They had good customer service, fees weren't too outrageous, buyer and seller protection plans were well backed and well maintained, etc... In the past year eBay has pretty much become a contactless company. It is nearly impossible to get a representative on the phone and when you do they are inexperienced. Not only do they not know their own policies but also do not abide by them when you read the policy straight to them. They are allowing false returns, allowing buyers to send back items using false claims and doing nothing to provide any seller protection whatsoever when evidence is provided because ""they don't have the item in front of them to inspect it themselves"". A very convenient way of saying ""sorry about your luck, I'm going to break"". This has cost me personally thousands of dollars this year alone. They are also allowing illegal activities in the form of defamation and libel in the feedback section. For those who don't understand this, libel is a written false statement against a business or person, visible to the public that has the ability to cause loss of business, revenue, reputation, etc... It's United States law. Ebay is based in the United States and is therefore obligated to follow United States law, which in many cases they are not. I have actually lost over $500 to their incompetence in the past week alone. Even though the fees are higher, I am starting the transition back to Amazon very soon.

This is how it works. The seller will place a few items for sale they don't stock. When a buyer purchases the item the seller will produce a tracking number and remove the funds through their merchant but never give the package to the carrier. Now if the shipping date is about a week and a half they have your money in their account. They can now pay their operating costs for a week when they do this across the board. Floating on other peoples stolen or so called borrowed money. By the time the Ebay policy kicks in the seller has already taken your money for two weeks. I called the postal carrier early in the process and they did an investigation that was posted into tracking information located on ebay. The package was never given to them.  I called the bank and immediately reported fraud on my card. You will get your money back but why let crooks borrow it? I even tracked down the seller to a CA warehouse that don't answer when you contact them. Ebay allows it and will not step in and refund you until the shipping dates expire. The seller then blames the carrier. The uneducated people who work for ebay don't understand the scam. They will wait until after the shipping due date to act giving the benefit of the doubt to their crooked sellers. Meanwhile you already had to call your bank! Too late ebay security! You can't spot fraud if someone mugged you!,US

I'm a new seller, I had plans to be full time but I can't trust ebay representatives. Some examples are ebay screening system to get a supervisor has me on hold going back and forth explain why I need supervisor, they put or transfer calls to teammates that aren't supervisors, this leads to more calls and days consumed with no resolve, then reps make comments like ""thanks for calling again""  It's impossible to know what to expect, ebay has told me a few times to ""act professional"". In 2 separate calls I was told 1st that I was lied to, a second rep told me that ebay wasn't going to help. Professionalism? I don't think the problems that exist on ebay are necessarily the buyers or sellers fault, the problem is the note taking amongst ebay employees that not only decide your dispute but this note taking system affects how your call experience will be. They refuse to stop unwanted communications, when the communications are threatening and vengeful. Notes on the account that favor the buyer are somehow lost while the notes to waste our time are being mentioned or referred to during call. They don't listen.

As I expected, the ban was probably done automatically so on the day I took screenshot of the conversation between me and the assistant. Well, it didn't do much. I couldn't show the proof of what actually happened because they didn't let me. They kept saying - once its done, it cannot be undone. I get it and I don't care - wouldn't want to use eBay anymore after what has happened - I just wanted them to know what they did and didn't want anyone to go through the same.  Long story short, I got banned from eBay for the decision that was made by an eBay assistant. eBay - honestly, well done.",GB

It is killing its own trade through greed and they cant see it. You can tell when it really gets bad, they start trying to do flashy adverts on TV - which only shows the state they are in. Within the last two decade listing and selling fees have increased from 5% to over 13% + listing of final price.  They also changed their policy to allow ANYBODY to list in the UK with FAKE VAT numbers and a 28 day delivery with a return address in China?? I have reported just under 100 of these to Ebay this year and some to the HMRC, yet nothing has been done, probably as they make Ebay money. They will turn a blind eye as a VAT number as far as they are concerned is proof - EVEN if it is for a hair dresser that went bankrupt 15 years ago ! It isnt hard to use their database to match all identical VAT Numbers and check the locations and company details. Honestly most of these stand out like a sore thumb. Counterfeit items are another shocking thing they let slide. There are numerous fake watches and branded clothes - but again being imported with a fake VAT number they dont do anything. Selling fees are the key here, make money not worry about law and order. Now for Selling, there are numerous people who scam (type Ebay scams) you'll find them. Ebay IS aware and will do little to nothing to help. The scenario they will take is the Buyer is always protected so as a seller you will have funds taken from you regardless. Think again if you think Royal Mail signed for is proof - Ebay say it isn't, anyone could sign for that, how do you know it was the real customer. You need signed and tracked.  Heres the best bit, EBAY are no longer with PAYPAL they are different companies and have no ties - you can use Paypal to buy on Ebay, but cannot sell and use it for Ebay fees. Instead EBAY insist that you give them FULL ACCESS TO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT WITH UNLIMITED ACCESS TO FUNDS - yes you read that right, they want to have the ability to take unlimited funds from your bank account without question or warning. So that item you just sold, if it has gone to a scammer expect to have all the funds taken and your item lost without question. I would highly suggest using a number of other sites, there are a few to name; Amazon (Very little listing fee - but no auctions, yet), Facebook market place (no fees), Gumtree (Although owned by Ebay no fees) and I'm sure you can find more local.  Whoever is now running Ebay is only interested in lining their pockets while killing the once great community. Just like the fall of the Roman Empire, took much power and greed, look what happened.",GB

One of the cameras failed in the warranty period, the seller said i could wait 14 days of buy 2 new cameras at a discounted rate. I asked how can I order a pair of cameras but not have a replacement, no words. Disgraceful. So I left negative feedback to help others avoid the seller, some months later checked on the feedback and discovered it had been removed, not once but THREE TIMES ! furious i contacted eBay demanding an explanation as to why it had been removed. I was told it violated eBay's feedback policy, so I further prodded eBay support asking which policy specifically applied and how and they told me they could not tell me. so I accused eBay of accepting bribes to falsely list positive feedback in stead of legitimate feedback. I was told that it is illegal to accept bribes and that eBay does not do that with a smiley face at the end of the statement. As far as I am concerned eBay is accepting bribes from sellers to remove negative feedback and mislead buyers into believing the seller has positive reviews. absolutely disgraceful. As a customer on eBay for over 16 years and to be treated this way I am shocked and appalled at how far they have fallen, how the mighty have fallen, this is the beginning of the end for eBay in my belief. I hope the crash and burn just like they burned their own loyal customers. And its a shame as it was a great place for buying and selling before they sold their souls.

Yet, I have sold more items in the past two years, and 24 sold in my overview within the past month. Obviously, Support were too lazy to check my feedback and selling record.

Support also went on to claim that the reason had to do with my seller record and that I defaulted on posting items , despite my seller record being ""above average"" and spotless.

So I accepted the buy now bids and got the items ready to post. I checked the buyer, their history, their reviews and all seemed good. Three days of waiting for an address after receiving the buy now's and the buyer claimed unauthorised account access on their end, my ads were deleted to 'protect the buyer' and eBay wouldn't put my ads back and could do nothing to notify my previous watchers or anything. I spent 2 hours getting great photos and writing really great ads for my items for 'fraud' to see my first ever sale items messed with, my time wasted and now I'm completely put off. eBay support was not helpful at all and the only reason I tried them was because they market themselves as safer etc. Yeah right, and if I had sold my items through them after all that they still would have pocketed 12%. No thanks, I have sold dozens of items on Facebook with no problem and have kept ever cent of the sale. There is no extra protection actually included with adding your items here and your time could be wasted by people clicking buy now. At least on other platforms, you have power over whether your ads stay up when a buyer is a fraud.",AU

We sell clothes... they now get 15% of every order under $2000, which is 95% of the orders.   On top of that they now essentially force the average user into using their third party payment system like Payoneer.  Payoneer then charges an additional $10+ per transfer.  So... $300 order, ebay takes $45 for basically doing nothing on every order but let you do a lot of work to list items on their platform in a very non-user friendly fashion.  This is assuming you even just use their free listings, not  paying extra for stupid things like ""BOLDING THE HEADSLINE"" ... is this 2002 or what?  Then Payoneer takes another $10-15 when you transfer money into an account you can actually use the funds for running the business.  Say you are doing transfers every 3 orders, That leaves you with $245.  Minus actual shipping and COGS, the margins are negligible.   IE... not really worth the cost of doing business on their platform.  Why am I working for essentially free, just to make eBay and Payoneer rich?  eBay has become one of the THE WORST online platforms around.

In the listing, I explicitly stated that no refunds would be given for buyer's remorse. The buyer could only receive a refund if the guitar arrived damaged. Long story short, the buyer claimed the guitar was damaged during shipping and they wanted a refund. I agreed, but once I received the guitar back, the guitar looked intentionally damaged. It was returned in the exact same box that had no puncture marks. They used the same bubble wrap I used, despite claiming it was old. I shipped the guitar in a thick gig bag that was wrapped in bubble wrap inside of a sturdy box. Despite there being no slices in the bubble wrap or the box, the gig bag is perfectly sliced and the guitar has a chip (more like a smash) that will cost $500-600 to repair! I took it to two different guitar shops and they couldn't believe that the gig bag would have been sliced like that during shipping. Ebay first decided that I had to give the money back. I appealed this decision and was told I would receive a $600 credit which I thought was fair since I had the guitar.

They won’t reply to the cases raised and have refused to issue a refund despite the shirt actually being returned stretched as if it has been tried on an elephant.

The sellers on eBay are the backbone of its infrastructure, and it is my guess they are leaving eBay one by one little by little, like me, and that is all A well deserveD punishment to eBay. To not overextend myself, I will explain briefly what the latest incident was. I have been an eBay for many many years, selling a little mostly buying a lot. I never had a problem like the one I have been having for the last two or three weeks as a seller. I listed a perfume that I bought three months ago for an eBay, and all of a sudden, with no explanation whatsoever, eBay removed this listing on the basis of being a counterfeited product. I tried to contact eBay in different ways, chat, phone, and besides being almost impossible, when I finally did talk to a human, they could not give me any explanation or evidence that my product was fake or counterfeited. I thought there might be an issue with my pictures so I tried to list it it again, and again was removed after three times, and again with no explanation. I asked them why they are punishing me, if they have to punish somebody, why dont punish also the person who sold me the product on their own company, that is eBay, in case they are so sure that this product was a replica? The seller, However, is still listing That same product that they removed on my account. A week later I listed another perfume, and they removed it also. The week after, I list another perfume, and they remove it also. All the time with the same issue of being a replica. All three perfumes I purchased for an eBay in the previous months. Apparently, I am being flagged by eBay for no reason and they are restricting my account because of that. But not only that, they are censoring my reviews in the discuss.com site, flagging them also as spam. This is totally unacceptable. So the first question, fundamental one, Is: Under what basis or evidence they remove a listing saying is not authentic or is a replica when they don’t have any proof or a real evidence? I consider myself an expert and collector of perfumes, modern and vintage, and I am completely sure that these three perfumes were authentic and not replica of counterfeitEd. Second question is, even if they do have any type of evidence, Why they don’t explain it to the seller? Third question is, if they are going to punish one person like me, why they don’t also punish the person or persons that sold me those counterfeited products, who are still listing those the same products and they’re there on platform in the same way as I was doing it and they did before?  All these situation let let me to cancel my listings, all of them on eBay, put them for sale on a different platform in which I sold two of those three products in the first week with no problem. Now I am an active seller in the other platform and I will not go back to eBay. And the reason is obvious. eBay has become a monster that functions as a giant cyber machine, totally dehumanized, That treats sellers with Disrespect, and imposes arbitrary and unfounded measures like those I mentioned, leaving us feeling we are being abused, unfairly punished, and wondering if there is a discriminatory reason behind it...  In any case, Ebay is not to be trusted anymore. It is not a company that deserves our products, our trust, our money. I would encourage others to leave them, and find other venues to sell. Soon Ebay will loose its hegemony in the online market place, and then, if they ever wonder why, I will redirect them to this letter. They are, basically, a bunch of crooks that give s...t about any of us or any other thing besides increasing profits by becoming a money making monster. Shame on you!",US

Not to mention the last time I bought a car part and was sent the incorrect item for my vehicle I got stuck with it because the customer service rep I talked to said she sensed I was a ""remorse buyer"" and just didn't want the item any more...laughable. I threw it in the trash and lost the money because I didn't want to deal with it anymore. Cheers",US
2391,www.ebay.com,2021-09-28T18:15:20.000Z,1,Sold an item on ebay for £400,"Sold an item on ebay for £400. It was delivered 2 days later. The buyer contacted me 28 days later to say that a bit was broken of it when delivered and he decided to glue it back on and put it on a car anyway but it was not working so he wanted a refund. I obviously asked why he did not initiate a return immediately and was told that was none of my business. I then initiated a return as i wanted the bit back as i suspected the buyer wanted to keep the bit and be refunded. The buyer didn't send the bit back but opened a case. I called eBay and asked why he had opened a case, i had said he could have a refund but i wanted my part back (which i am allowed to do)  EBay agreed that he needed to return the item and then i could refund. They even sent him a return pre paid label. 8 days later ebay closed the case in the buyers favour because they said i did not respond? even though they have the call and the messages and the 2 refunds i initiated the buyer did not return the item and they get a refund from me. I know i have been conned I called ebay and am told that the only choice i have is for the case to go to the escalation department and to wait 24 to 48 hours and if i lose that then tough so if you are thinking of selling big value items on ebay be warned as you may be conned and ebay will lie and side with the seller in all cases. I have proof that i initiated a return, that ebay also initiated a return and that i kept in contact yet ebay still decided to refund the buyer and let him keep my item. I will be going to the press with all the details of my case as i am so disgusted with how ebay can lie and close a case because of no contact when even the advisor said he could see i called and initiated returns.

Ebay has long ceased to fight for its reputation and does absolutely nothing to sort out each specific case of fraud. In the best case, you get standard unsubscriptions from the support service, and maintaining a dialogue is impossible, since a new employee responds to each of your requests. In the worst case, if you still managed to prove the fact of fraud, the support service begins to pretend that they are helping you, but at the same time you receive letters like: ""the case was closed in your favor, but then we decided ..."" or ""we tried to contact with you on the phone but you do not answer therefore ... "". Then, you will simply be told that 30 days have passed and they can no longer help you. It must be remembered that it is also useless to file a lawsuit on Ebay in Russia. The plaintiff, by joining the user agreement, agreed that conflicts between him and the Ebay website are governed by the laws of the United States of Utah, where you should contact. In many cases, Ebay employees are themselves participants in large-scale fraudulent schemes, but it is almost impossible to prove anything, since Ebay protects its employees. If you use the Ebay platform, always remember: sooner or later you will be deceived and you will lose either goods or money, or both. And no one will help you with this. If you are a journalist or blogger, then never criticize this company publicly as you may find yourself in a situation similar to this: “A former eBay employee will spend a year and a half in prison for conspiring to persecute two journalists who spoke negatively about the service. they made the critics' life hell - terrorized them with phone calls at night, left scary messages on their doorstep and tried to break into their garage.

I asked her to file an insurance claim through the USPS and she refused insisting I just give her money.  I filed the claim for her and asked her to retain original packaging and the broken piece.  In the meantime, she filed a return request through eBay for the wrong listing. I spoke with eBay 'agents' FIVE TIMES trying to sort this out and each time they assured me I would be covered as a seller and they would work with me.  Lies.  When my time refund her money lapsed, they sent her a return label.  She returned only the mug.  I took the mug to the PO and followed the claim process.  In the meantime, I had spoken with an 'agent' again to inform them of the value of the one item from that listing and told them I would be willing to refund her that much.  They refunded the ENTIRE COST of that item - STILL THE WRONG ITEM NUMBER.  Now I'm out $80 instead of the $17 the single item was worth, and she still has all of the pieces of the listing she claimed a return on and will most likely sell those for a profit to her.

2493,www.ebay.com,2021-09-15T00:58:03.000Z,4,FROM 1 TO 4 STARS,"EDIT / UPDATE: from 1 star to 4 Within less than 24 hours my crappy situation was turned around thanks to one upper manager. I wholly believe giving credit where credit is due so listed here is my updated response (with the original review still listed below) ...  An upper level representative contacted me back saying that they had reviewed everything had were closing the case in my favor. They refunded me in whole, are going to coach the rep I had originally talked with, AND are reviewing the seller I had a problem with. I did not expect a response back, especially one that was so positive and professional. Because of this one person being so awesome I have decided to continue using Ebay, albeit with more discretion on who I do business with on there.  I still strongly suggested having the option to edit or reopen dispute tickets as most of the problem could have been solved with that.  (( ORIGINAL REVIEW - 1 STAR)) -- I've ordered off Ebay a few times. What I've learned is that if you have ANY problem Ebay will NOT resolve it. So basically, using Ebay is like gambling - if you get a loss, well, you're SOL.  My most recent purchase was a loss. I had accidentally used the wrong address for shipping and didn't find out till USPS said that the package was being returned to seller. I had contacted the seller several times with no response. After a week of the seller sitting on the returned package, I go to open a refund dispute. What Ebay fails to mention upon opening a dispute is that you only get ONE dispute chance. Can't edit it. Can't reopen it. The options for ""why are you opening a dispute with this seller?"" is trash. Little options and no ""other"" given. I picked the best choice only to be met with continual options for ""how do you want the package sent back?"". But I don't have the package. So I cancel out the dispute, with no warning given that I only get one chance at it, and try to go back in to find a better option to continue with. I obviously don't have that option ... Now, with no dispute channel and the seller ghosting me, I reach out to Ebay themselves. They refused to help me because that one-shot ticket was closed out. They won't reopen it ... they won't contact the seller on my behalf either. They literally won't do anything because ""they don't feel like it"". They also told me to ""take it up outside of Ebay"". Like ... why. Am I supposed to take seller Billy behind the gym and beat his butt to get my money back?? In the end, I am now forced to resolve my stolen money with my bank (at least I have more evidence on my side than the sun shines on earth). I'll get my money back (from the bank) but now seller Billy gets to keep the product and my stolen money while Ebay watches and laughs.  Even if I'm tempted I will NOT be buying from Ebay ever again. I will not chance having my money stolen by a seller again with no help from the website.",US

A buyer bought this, but subsequently changed his mind and I received a message from eBay asking if I would agree to the cancellation, which I did. I was told be eBay that I would have to refund the buyer for the £700, and they would then deduct the £90 fee from me. Two issues with that. Firstly, they hadn’t sent me the funds, and secondly, I didn’t feel I should pay the fee for an item I hadn’t sold. I called an agent and was assured that I wouldn’t have to pay the fee and that they would refund the buyer. Subsequently, I received a message from the buyer asking for the refund. I then had to contact eBay again to ask them why the buyer had not been refunded. This time I used the Chat function, I was passed around four agents (if you include the one I was passed to twice, who was the second and fourth agent). After almost 90 minutes of discussion, I had established that the funds were still with eBay, and they would resolve the problem, and I didn’t need to do anything more. Some days later, I received an email from eBay announcing that they would retrieve their £90 fee from my account. So I phoned them again, again I had to relate the whole story to an agent. At the end of this conversation, she told me to be reassured that I would not be charged the fee. Some days after this, I received an email saying that I was never allowed to sell anything on their platform again. I then contacted them on Chat saying that I demanded an apology and immediate reinstatement, otherwise I would relate this whole shambolic episode somewhere in a public forum.

Sometimes they promise to escalate the issue, but it's pointless trying to speak with the person to whom they are going to escalate, because that person works for an internal department which is not customer facing.

Many sellers encounter similar problems of account blocking problems, we no longer control our sales, we can no longer do dropshipping since Ebay withholds your payment until the item is sent to the buyer which is damage and will lead to a significant drop in turnover for Ebay, professional seller for 15 years now, I have to go sell elsewhere, Ebay is like modern companies which squeeze their employees and then throw them away when they need it most. The buyer can no longer pay with Paypal or by bank transfer, commissions have increased with this new payment system, read the testimonials of sellers and buyers disappointed with Ebay on Trustpilot. Actually what happens with Ebay, I think some Ebay employees are sellers too, when Ebay asks you for information about your suppliers to supposedly verify your account when you have been selling with them for several years that's right to get information about your suppliers and pass it on to salespeople working in their homes. In fact Ebay behave with professional or private sellers registered with them for several years as complete strangers and it's quite frustrating, I have been with them for more than 15 years and the payments of my sales are withheld by Ebay to verify my information, no I think that Ebay wants to impose on me its new payment system which is to its advantage and not to the advantage of the sellers. I ask all sellers and buyers disappointed with Ebay to post negative reviews on Trustpilot, to make youtube videos explaining the problems encountered with Ebay, all with the aim of eBay continuing to stay far behind Amazon and other websites. e-commerce that allow other payment methods. Ebay persists in sticking to an old sales system by no longer allowing dropshipping, this company which is losing more and more sellers and advantages to dishonest buyers is not going to hold up for long, in fact you can't even give negative feedback to a buyer who has scammed you, be aware that there are sellers from Ebay and competing sellers who give you negative reviews for free that cannot be removed despite all your evidence. My shop on Ebay.com, I hardly go there anymore and I am about to close it permanently, it has been two months since I sent the same documents to Ebay to verify my account after being a model seller for more 15 year old with two negative feedback posted by an Ebay seller. In fact as a seller there is no real interaction with a human to check your documents and solve your problem, Ebay is run by robots, robots respond to you, do not solve problems, closes, blocks your account, etc. My advice to show our displeasure to this inhuman and arrogant company and to continue posting negative reviews on Trustpilot, to boycott Ebay by going to sell and buy on Amazon and other more ethical and seller-friendly e-commerce sites and hunting down dishonest buyers unlike Ebay which works with them. I posted a youtube video about it, type the following name into the youtube search engine: Ebay steals top sellers and buyers, DON'T BUY or SELL ON EBAY!",GP

I have been an eBay member for 21 years. During the pandemic I had to find a little more cash as my wife's practice was shut down for three months. I don't make as much profit from eBay sales as I do from my own catalog, but people often will pay more to buy from me through eBay. So specifically, I am commenting on my life with eBay for a bit more than a year. First, as a buyer, I've never had any issues. An item didn't work when I got it, seller apologized, refunded in full, told me to just trash the defective item. Another seller from overseas, shipped the item but it never arrived. Again, politely apologized, refunded me the amount. As a seller, I've had no problems. Selling fees have actually gone down. I've been guided through setting up unique products. Contact? I had a question yesterday. Sure, there's not a phone number at the bottom of every page, but there is a Contact/Help link. Follow that and if you can read and use a mouse, in about a minute you'll see where you can do an online chat or have them call you. I requested a call and my phone rang in less than a minute. Question was answered in no time, no getting put on hold or bounced around. Much of what we as sellers have to do is pay attention. You can set some limits on who can buy from you and you can state a very clear return policy which may work in your favor if you get the rare scammer trying to keep the money and the item. I don't think it's an unreasonable view that if eBay was really a one-star company, then they wouldn't last long. But not only is it good for the average person or small business, but you'll find some large companies also sell on eBay, no doubt because they appreciate the exposure. And as far as the buyer being given the benefit of the doubt, that's (IMHO) just the nature of the beast. Anybody's beast. It's certainly something I'd want as a buyer, and I have to live with it as a seller. Accept PayPal, ship only to their verified address, and you're protected. Use a tracking number. If you're a buyer you can request and should expect a tracking number. Again, this is just me. For those who aren't as lucky, believe me I feel your pain. I can only state that by running my business as carefully and as ethically as I can, me and eBay get along just fine.",US

As a seller for many years, we've had to deal with increasing unfairness - defaults for items delivered late by THEIR chosen couriers, Inability to leave fair feedback for bad buyers, summary dissmisal of default/negative feedback removal requests. Forced into Managed Payments, money holds for just about any reason for over a month, changing the rules so now all fees come off before you get anything, then adding in the monthly shop fees to that, then moving the date they take those fees to the start of the month, when it used to be 20th.   One of the things they dont deduct before they give your payout are postage fees, so you have to pay those out before you get the payment for the item, at least 48 hours before! The stupid thing is, with managed payments, now no funds go into paypal, so us small sellers who are largely also buyers, have no instant paypal funds to buy things.. me, I am so fed up with ebay, I purchase virtually everything now either at local shops, or Amazon. So, how much is ebay losing out on there. Up until yesterday, we had 100% feedback, but a buyer who wasnt happy with £7.99 postage costs, even though we gave her a discount on it (which she agreed to).   Hermes was late delivering and didnt deliver it Next Day as we paid for and yet Ebay REFUSED to remove the negative, so now that will sit on our account for 12 months!  We already lost our top rated badge, because of Hermes delivering late and us getting defects, but we dont have any other options.  We wont use UPS because once they gave us a load of penalties because we hadn't put items in boxes, just bags, so Hermes is the main one ebay offer and we use.

I'm completely miffed, I was selling jigsaw puzzles and canvas prints in Australia for goodness sakes! Completely ridiculous decision, nothing about me or what I do is fake or dubious.  I will never buy or sell on Ebay again and after reading all these reviews its not just sellers that have been mistreated by Ebay, it has also been buyers.  It seems that the common denominator amongst all the unfair behaviour lately is Ebay.  Amazon has already surpassed Ebay as an ecommerce platform and soon Facebook will too.  It won't be long before there are others.  The writing is on the wall for Ebay's demise and they will only have themselves to blame.",AU

But all  a buyer has to do regardless of a sellers return policy is check the box “defective or not as described” and no matter what the seller says eBay forces the seller to refund the money and be out all shipping charges as well!

As a seller. eBay is beyong Horrendous. I'm mostly bothering to review how bad eBay are because I recently decided to have a cull of items that don't sell very well (as bad sales on ONE item, have a mysterious but impossible to determine effect on ALL your items, because eBay algorithms) and then compress all the unpopular crap I have into a few smaller multiple choice listings. The HOURS I've lost because this horrendously pathetic website doesn't update changes I make when creating a listing, or absolutely fails to save the listing at all then I have to start from absolute scratch.

Ebay now charges you a seller fee on the tax they collect, even though you the seller never receive a penny of that money. They hide these details in their policy and their invoices. Do your homework. It's there. If a buyer pays $26 in tax you (the seller) pay 12% of the $26 or $3.12 even though you didn't receive any of that money. In my state of NC this is actually illegal. Collecting tax is a fiduciary responsibility. That money doesn't belong to ebay either. This is a class action law suit waiting. Ebay also can't control bad actors. I just won a sports card on a great deal. The seller canceled the order immediately before I could pay. However, ebay will not let me even leave negative feedback because the order was canceled before I could pay.  Ebay is setting a stage for bad actors with bad policies.

I went to eBay with this new information but they said it's not relevant anymore as the case has been closed in the buyers' favour. I appealed this decision but the case was promptly closed by eBay with no explanation.  The buyer ignored all my correspondence when I tried to ask them what happened as I find it hard to believe that after 4 delivery attempts they didn't pick up on the ""sorry we missed you"" cards couriers always leave.

Second pack stalled a whole week by customes with a hint of a word. The the email arrived that the postal service wanted me to re-pay the VAT? And charge a 160dkr ($25) expedition fee. Worst the VAT amount they wanted was WRONG as always. So Custumes is basicly just randomly guessing the VAT as they dont have the full info on the pack. Now here in Denmark its actually against the law to make a ""guess"" & before you make a ""calculation/judgement"", you MUST at least do a hearing of the citizen & get the right info. Being a offical myslef i do this everyday at work. Worst such a high profile offical outlet like Toldstyrelsen (customes) not following the Law is a laughingstock for me and my collegues for years now. Send proper Ebay IOSS to the PostNord postal service about the prepaid VAT & requested the pack get released AND i requested to have a new VAT calculation send to the Customes. The postal service NEVER send my request forward to Customes (how illegal is this?) And spammed me with copy&paste messages about ""the seller didnt provide a IOSS number"" so you must re-pay the 25% VAT or else we will return the pack. Didnt matter that my ""pack"" was completely innocent & had already spend 2 weeks in ""postal jail"" & i had the right dokumentation too. Talk about paragraph riders. Trying to contact Customes directly online dosnt work as their link for private people is dead & you get redirected to your taxes instead. Customes suggest to try to get a refund from ""the seller"". VAT is collected by Ebay themselves so i didnt have high hopes. The seller (very helpfull but also very confused) was easy to talk to but couldnt or wouldnt refund. Ebay themselves is a wall.

Yes, there are probably a lot of bogus sellers on there but us legitimate people need the protection from annoying buyers who do not read descriptions  or those who think they can send something back if it doesnt 'suit' them.  I go to great lengths to put a lof of description to selling items but recently had one cancellation before payment as they had not read the description and another who bought 2 items but appears to have 2 accounts and ebay wont let her relist ? so wants a refund.  Called Ebay customer service told me to refund although technically another one not reading the description and Ebay once again favour the buyer against the seller which messes with your inventory not to mention if you have sold using a discount.  It's pretty appalling they have now taken paypal away to take care of it all themselves and yet they cannot even egt the post office tracking online so you have to double check what has been delivered.  All in all, they need to get real with all the competition out there as they are not the only selling platform people will visit especially if they feel let down by poor customer service, not being able to easily contact Ebay and their ridiculous over protection of buyers over the sellers they are making money out of.

We sell online in Sweden and use eBay.com having pre-Brexit sold on eBay UK for over 5 years. eBay.com had its problems to start but after 3 months and over 60 messages, around 10 lengthy phone calls and at least 15 chat transcripts things were going okay. Then eBay decided to introduce 'Managed Payments' and the nightmare begins! Whoever at eBay thought up managed payments clearly had just escaped an asylum, as no rational person would introduce a payments system so flawed, and so full of ways to destroy and frustrate sellers! We sell on eBay.com and our sales and our invoice are in USD. Sweden's currency is in SEK but eBay doesn't know where Sweden is in the world (trust me most eBay staff think Sweden is Switzerland) so they decided that Managed Payments would now be in Euros for our sales. We have to convert our sales into Euros from USD and then back into USD for payment for our invoice. Any money left over is sent to our account in Euros.  We can't have one conversion of USD to SEK like any normal rational person or company would do, no on Planet eBay in San Jose the twisted Managed Payments team high-five each other in a circle as they convert the money we make from sales each time and skim a little off for commission to play their merry-go round currency swindle! Sales in USD converted to Euros. Payments in Euros to our bank in Sweden which are charged a fee because guess what, Sweden's currency is in SEK. Then the Euros are converted back to pay the eBay invoice in USD but the money we make couldn't be used to pay the eBay invoice in USD? No on Planet eBay in San Jose that isn't possible as common sense isn't something eBay believes in, nor likes! We are stuck now with a payments system that pays a currency about as useful as a square wheel in Sweden, and all the time we lose more and more money from our sales whilst eBay skims off the top. eBay is more like a mafia organisation in a crooked casino exchanging money countless times until there is nothing left! At what point will eBay see sense? Every message is ignored or replied to with a script that never deals with the problems we have.  eBay is not a site for sellers. It is the MOST expensive online platform to sell on with the MOST unhelpful customer support. We pay for an Anchor shop on eBay and are meant to get 'Premium Support' but I think 'Premium' on Planet eBay in San Jose means the worst support available online, because that is what it is every time we contact them for help! eBay will never bother responding to this review nor will they change what they do as eBay is always right and its users are ALWAYS wrong! However, whoever set up Managed Payments on eBay needs to be sent to eBay Antartica as there they will hopefully do as little damage as possible on eBay because eBay's Managed Payments is the worst change on eBay EVER! If you have thought about selling on eBay think again! There are many more less stressful and kinder online selling sites. Using eBay is a nightmare, and they treat sellers with contempt and no respect.  If you still decide to use eBay to sell on after this review and you start to have any of the problems we’ve listed above then you’ve only got yourself to blame!",GB

I work for an entirely separate company part-time and occasionally, I will log in to their eBay account from home to carry out minor administrative duties such as responding to messages etc. This is apparently enough to link my personal account with theirs.  For the past two months, I have been furloughed (away from work), and a colleague was left in charge of tending to the company’s eBay account while I am away. During this time, none of the regular duties such as dispatching orders, responding to return requests etc. were fulfilled and this flagged up on eBay’s system and eventually mounted up to the point of the account being restricted. This in turn restricted my personal account due to them being ‘linked’.  I found all of this out by calling eBay’s customer services every day for two solid weeks. Every day I was told a different story by increasingly incompetant representatives who would pass me off to a different department because none of them had any idea what they were talking about. In the meantime, my colleague at the company was experiencing the same issues with customer support, trying to resolve an issue which was an ultimately futile effort. I have had issues such as these in the past with eBay's appalling customer services team and I can wholeheartedly say they are the most useless, careless and utterly incompetant group of people I have ever encountered. eBay was my primary source of income, and in my final effort, pleading with them to appeal the decision, I was told, despite the fact that what happened to the company’s account while I was away was entirely out of my control and I am void of fault, that the decision would be final. All due to a major discrepancy in eBay’s corporate policy. When eBay tells you they care about small business, they do not. Nor do they care about buyers or any of their customers for that matter. Throughout my seven-year-long relationship with eBay I have encountered policy issues like this numerous times which have caused me great deals of stress. Buying, and especially selling on eBay is a huge risk which is just not worth taking.",GB

Now we’ve hit a problem because of managed payments, without going into details it’s a little bit involved because all of the components of the business are located in different countries (I live in Malta but we sell in the US and the company is Irish due to my partners being from Dublin ) this was never a problem before with PayPal  but now it’s almost insurmountable to get everything organised and the left-hand with eBay does not know what the right hand is doing, in fact it’s such a joke they are now talking about referring it to what they call their concierge service but nothing seems to be getting done and we’re just not making progress. We’ve simply decided to email all of the regular buyers directly and refer them to our normal website telling them that we are now ceasing to deal with eBay it frankly isn’t worth the stress.  My colleagues pointed out that the amount of money we make from eBay in comparison with the normal business and the sites which we have on Shopify and elsewhere is such that  it just doesn’t justify carrying on with all this nonsense. End result after nearly 20 years we have decided to wrap it up and call it a day with eBay and I think frankly anyone else who is having hassle with them should look at other options like a Shopify store or Big commerce, there are plenty of other options out there and they work out a lot cheaper than all this messing around with eBay and their returns systems, there are some complications with The transition but thank God we had started to focus more on the websites prior to all this nonsense arising. It was interesting that a friend of mine who sells classic car parts pointed out that eBay accounted for 10% of the income but 80% of the hassle I think that made up my mind as to what I was going to do so having discussed it with my partners we have decided to call it a day and have no further dealings with our eBay accounts already we are seeing the benefit that the stress reduction is enormous.",CH

But sometime during the pandemic, I noticed some items I had purchased, that without a doubt listed a guaranteed date of delivery, were reverting to ""estimated by"" after the seller input shipping information.  This only happened sporadically.  But now EVERY TIME I purchase an item that says ""guaranteed by"" on the item's listing page, it reverts to ""estimated by"" once shipped, and my purchases very often do not arrive by the date it says. The huge difference between the two, is, if a purchase ""guaranteed by"" does not arrive by the date stated, a customer can request a $5 eBay credit, to reimburse for shipping paid that did not live up to the promise stated.  But now that all my purchases are just ""estimated"" and not guaranteed, no matter what the page says at the time I make the purchase, I have no recourse to take if my packages do not arrive on time! You can't get a credit on ""estimated by"" listings.  (I would much rather receive everything by the date stated, but, at least with guaranteed by, I got reimbursed if the sellers slow-shipped things) I'm done with eBay!! 😡 I'll give my business to Amazon, instead. At least paying the $12.95 for Prime shipping WILL get me truly GUARANTEED fast shipping.  I probably was paying more than that each month on eBay in the jacked up prices the sellers listed the ""free"" ""guaranteed by"" items, just to have them revert to ""estimated by"" then arrive 1 to 3 days (sometimes 4 or 5 days) past the date that said guaranteed at time of purchase!!!! 😡😡😡😡 Do yourself a favor, stay away from eBay. 👎",US

A lot of those items were good like trash bags, phone parts & accessories, computer parts, etc. I have also been ripped off a few times buying used parts like CPUs which had bent pins before I used them myself & eBay sided with the seller who had a good amount of bad reviews. I just thought that the seller might have had some of those ...hats you sometimes get trying to get free items so I ignored the bad feedback like a moron & I literally paid the price. That was a $250 loss on my part with an item I could do nothing with. One of the reasons I now refuse to buy CPUs that have pins being there are a lot of Intel CPUs that do not have pins. Problem solved. Another seller sold me a SuperMicro Workstation motherboard which was New OEM never opened claimed by the seller. When I got the motherboard I was unable to use it because OEM boards come with a special password that can not be changed & is found on the CPU slot via a sticker which was not in the box. So I contacted the seller & he tried to screw me by asking me for pay him for the password which he wanted $120 for. BS on that! So I contacted eBay & low & behold they sided with the seller. Another $300 down the toilet! Even SuperMicro could not help me because it was OEM & didn't reset like retail boards, but they at least tried to help me. Using the board without access to the BIOS was a royal pain but I did use it till I built my newest socket 1200 I now use which I bought all the parts from Amazon & everything works.

Emails from the seller described the item as 7 years old and in good condition. When the watch arrived it became obvious the Chronograph was faulty.  When I contacted the seller his emails were abusive and unhelpful. I then contacted the manufacturer and they confirmed the watch was actually 12 years old and not 7. The seller then offered a refund of £150 which I refused. I contacted PayPal who found in the sellers favour and was unable to leave negative feedback with Ebay. This is a bizarre situation and makes me wonder if other negative feedback has been blocked by Ebay. How is this rogue allowed to operate with impunity considering the alleged checks and balances which Ebay say they operate. Any luxury items you consider purchasing should be done with care and avoid Ebay like the plague. A corrupt unethical organisation best left well alone AND under no circumstances be guided by their feedback system. Like most organisations, it’s manipulated in favour of Ebay’s earning with scant regard for the buyer. It’s called how to assist and encourage fraud ( or theft to me and you.)  I have been with eBay since 2002 and have only seen a steady decline in standards and customer service.

This issue should have been settled a lot sooner, and demonstrated, once again, how inept eBay customer service really is. These reps read from a script book and are probably told not to deviate with eBay policies, even when overwhelming evidence is presented. This why eBay CS is useless in most cases.

Ebay are definitely pocketing that money and passing it off as seller tax. The seller explicitly said they are setting to price to 87 so they had no idea I was charged 119. Be upfront about it, asshats.",IE

First they blackmailed me by restricting my account UNLESS I changed to their system, provided my bank details to them, and left PayPal which I truely have loved and respected for so many years. WOW blackmailed into providing my bank details. That's pretty good eBay! I can get my money for my sold items immediately with PayPal. Now with the eBay dinosaur system it takes up to a week to obtain MY money from MY sold items which is HOW eBay stay in business.But I notice eBay take their cut from the sale, take their cut from postage yes from POSTAGE which I make noting from (can someone explain why?) and then tell me to POST my sold item when I do NOT have the postage money (what's left of it) to enable me to post the buyers item. The humongous money suck from eBay has finally FINALLY made me stop selling. My little business is now extinct. It is no more. I am done finished kaput! I pulled my items from sale. Summing up I wish eBay all the best with the thousands of cheap Chinese made products from Chinese companies. But hey buyers you can buy these items through other sources.

Items that are no longer as popular or are somewhat outdated, especially electronic items among other things are easier to find on Ebay than on Amazon. Ebay's website is easy to navigate and I appreciate the fact that Ebay makes it a matter of concern to get involved if the seller doesn't respond or ship the item that you've purchased. Dealing with sellers on Ebay isn't always hassle free, because often they are ordinary individuals and we as customers need to keep this in mind. There have been issues in the past with price gouging and scams, especially during the pandemic, I have noticed that Ebay has tried to ban such individuals, but it's impossible to catch them all. Some scammers only sell their items for a few hours or a day and then disappear when they feel that they've sold enough of their items. Ebay allows the seller rather they are a company or a person to give a detailed description of their item (s), post pictures and so on, this is not always the case for other websites, and the websites that do allow this aren't always necessarily good at it. I also like the fact that you're usually given a tracking number for your order when it ships, so that you can personally see where your order is. If not you can always request one from the seller. This is not the case with all orders on Amazon. For items that are delivered with Amazon you have to rely on their internal tracking number, which you can't personally track. This is primarily due to the fact that most sellers on Ebay ship with USPS, and sometimes with UPS or FEDEX. However, despite the fact that Ebay offers a variety of goods it doesn't offer a variety of services like Amazon does.",US

On the tracking I could se ""delivery attempted"" on the 10th of May 2021, so I expected that I would get an update where to pick it up, but to my surprise I never did to this date. I contacted the Swedish carrier (PostNord), and they said that they presumed that the package has been lost, and that I should contact the seller for a refund. I contacted the seller on eBay, who refused to give me a refund a month later where the expected delivery date has passed by a mile, they said that I just must wait, and after claiming a refund again they called me ""abusive"" and said it was my fault for not being home, and then stopped responding. I made eBay claim and though I would get my money back since the seller stopped responding, the tracking number shows delivery attempted over a month ago and the expected delivery date has passed. But boy was I wrong, eBay declined and they would not give me refund, they marked the package as delivered even though the tracking number states ""delivery attempted"" and said that I must contact the carrier to pick the item up, now must make another claim if I disagree, I thought it was a joke! PostNord confirmed 3 times, that the package is LOST and that they are not in possession of it and don't know where it is, other than it is lost. I send them all 3 PostNord confirmations that the package is lost, but they want an official letter from PostNord to them, I cannot forward the e-mails from PostNord to eBay because that option is not available, you can only attach a file, so I attached the mail I got from PostNord, but that was not enough. I am getting a bit annoyed with the seller and eBay, they guarantee is worth nothing, they do not want to help, and make is difficult as possible for you to stop going any further. This is the first time they are acting up and demanding and official letter from the Swedish carrier. The Swedish carrier as stated in the mails I got don't understand that since they in the e-mail now twice had confirmed that the package is lost, and that is obvious. The package was lost, I never received it, the seller calls calls be abusive when wanting a refund, then stops responding, PostNord confirmed is has been lost, but eBay still agrees with the seller and does not issue me a refund, eBay marks the package as delivered even though the tracking number never stated that, the tracking number shows ""delivery attempted"" and not delivered and now they want an official letter stating that the package is lost, 3 e-mails confirmation is not enough! So avoid eBay, they marked my package as delivered when is was not, and now makes me prove that it is lost eventhough they can see that on the tracking and the 3 e-mails from the Swedish carrier, so I lost 100 dollars! eBay protects their sellers NOT their buyers, so again avoid eBay!",SE

He added that he verified through eBay that he could refuse to return my money even if I returned the shirt.

3177,www.ebay.com,2021-07-02T08:26:33.000Z,1,Horrible Company and Crooked Sellers Working the System,"I ordered a cigarette holder on 6/3/21, on Ebay.com, and the order supposedly shipped on 6/7/21, though there has been no movement on the order since 6/7/21. According to USPS.com, USPS never actually received the order. I was contacted by the store seller on 6/14/21, after repeatedly reaching out to them in order to be refunded for my order of a cigarette holder which never arrived. They claimed that they did not receive my first message, even though it looks as if the message went through just fine on my end, and I have a copy of the message in my messages within Ebay. They also claimed they would issue me a refund, though after checking my account, I don’t see that a refund has been processed. I feel as if I am now being given the run around by this seller and I would appreciate it if the Better Business Bureau would intervene and help me to receive a refund for this order, as I honestly do not believe that this seller intends to refund my money without intervention. I submitted a complaint to the Better Business Bureau, so we’ll see what happens there. Also, the seller also claimed that USPS lost my order, so, the order is definitely not going to arrive.  Yet after the seller stated, in a message sent to me via Ebay, that USPS had supposedly lost my order, they still refuse to refund my money. Initially they were going to issue a refund to me for the order USPS supposedly “lost,” though after they saw that I left a negative review for them on their seller profile on Ebay, since their communication was so very poor and since they were just very rude in their messages to me, they informed me that they were no longer going to issue a refund to me for the lost order. This is most unprofessional, to initially state that you are going to issue a refund to a customer, and then to deny a customer a refund because they left you a bad review. They also claimed they were denying me a refund because my communication was not good. Which is ridiculous, all of my messages were very clear. They are denying me a refund because I left them a bad review, plain and simple. You don’t get to violate the terms of a sales agreement simply because a customer leaves you a negative review. If every seller did this then Ebay would have a very bad reputation and customers would quit using their services and Ebay would go out of business.  To make matters worse, when I try to get assistance through Ebay, I am also unable to get assistance as I keep getting a message that a tracking number has been provided, and therefore since the seller has provided a tracking number, Ebay will not intervene. Ebay really needs to make it easier to handle disputes. Simply because a tracking number has been provided, this does not mean that the order has not been lost and that a buyer will not be in need of further intervention from Ebay. Of course, I found no number for Ebay, so, I cannot even contact Ebay via a customer service number. Ebay also does not provide an email address, so, I cannot email them either. I have no other recourse but to open a Better Business Bureau Complaint if I ever want to receive a refund. Ebay really needs to revise their intervention process. As it stands, a seller can simply stall and manipulate the system and there is no real recourse that a customer has. All a seller has to do is to simply provide a tracking number and there is nothing a customer can do in order to receive a refund in the event their order is lost and the seller refuses to do the right thing and to issue a refund. Ebay makes it too easy for sellers to work the system.  This is not really about the money, $6.84 is not a large sum of money. Though this is about the principle of the matter. This is about Ebay making it easy for sellers to work the system and how incredibly difficult it is to make a dispute through Ebay. This is about the many sellers on Ebay who take advantage of people. It’s wrong, just plain and simple.",US

Plus 20.. so if a case that it’s closed for 30 days you can’t appeal- tell me why they just now decided to refund the money to the cheat buyer ??? Scammers,US

3186,www.ebay.com,2021-06-16T16:22:34.000Z,1,New Managed payment system is a HOAX,"Ebay is now leading platform for e-commerce but I hope that others will really compete as soon as possible. Ebay is charging clients with huge and unresonable fees. The new managed payment is a hoax. In fact it was made to rip off more and more money from the customers. The customer's interest had not preveal as they lied. It was just one interest: to rip more money for ebay. Example: Before, as a store owner, I paid 6.15% on each sale. Plus VAT plus some other fees and I was charged with about 10% -I was not charged with 10% from                  1.-shipment fee                  2.-sale taxes I was angry enough because Paypal charged me in addition with up to 7%. I hate Paypal since. So, I was happy to hear about a managed payment system which promise lower fees as far as Paypal was theoretically out of the scheme. I was wrong Ebay cheated and transformed everything in a hoax. They rised final value fee from 6.15 to 8.5. At first sight it is ok as Paypal fees are out of the scheme. BUT........Ebay charge 8.15% from ALL. They charge 8.15 from final value but ALSO from shipping fee and sales fees. Plus they charge 0.30 USD for each order which means another rip. In case of a sale with a final value of 30 USD they charge 8,5% from final value  plus 8,5% from shipment fee ( which means another 2% calculated at final value ) plus 8,5% from sales tax (another 1% from final value) plus another 1% from final value (equivalent of 0,30 USD fee/order). Do you think that this is all? No.....they charge in addition another 1.6% as international fee !!!! Before introducing new managed payment system I paid 4.5 USD as fees for a 30 USD selling (Ebay plus Paypal fees), now, after the introducing of new managed payment system I pay 4.6 USD......... Nothing was changed, except the pocket in which the fees are paid. Now, Paypal fees was theoretically out of the scheme but Ebay takes it all. In the same amount !!!! Do you think that this is all?.....No....Ebay force you to select just one bank account to receive the money from sales. This has to be conected to your residence. As far as I am in the european union I can not use a US dollar account even I have one. I am forced to have it only in euro. But I sell in USD. Ebay automatically change the USD into Euro without asking me. And guess.... they do it for more that 3% commision !!!!!! Nice job for them of course. Nothing good for ebay members !! Paypal was sacrificed, they will go down as far as new payments methods are coming fast from behind (Google pay, Apple pay, Alipay, Wise, Revolut, N26 and so on). I am happy to know that Paypal will go down because they were not fair at all. I hope that Ebay will share the same destiny as Paypal. Another platform with much less fees may make ebay members to migrate. Maybe Amazon will do it if they will open for private persons, or Alibaba.com or Aliexpress.com or a new platform. Ebay will deserve to go down or even die because they skinned customers with their huge taxes. They have more than 15% profit from sales since some ebay customers are selling with less than 10% profit and they work hard for it. I hope that I will say someday : ""Goodbye Ebay, welcome new ebaylike platform with less fees and more consideration for the clients"". I have no hope about reformation of Ebay with reducing fees...the only hope is competition !!",RO

3192,www.ebay.com,2021-06-12T19:29:47.000Z,1,Must read BEFORE you consider ebay!!!,"I wish I could rate a negative star rating because I would!!!  I have been selling things through ebay for over 20 years but I am done with it!!!!  This is for several fundamental issues that are perfectly illustrated in the following transaction.  I sold a custom bundle of 265 games for $1,000.  They were worth over $3,000 but I am really sick of dealing with all the dishonest consumers, and more importantly with ebay for enabling the theft in the first place.  Trust me when I say I'm not the only victim.  Anyway, I have been forced by ebay to refund a false customer before, so I was really nervous to continue with the sale.  I decided to talk to ebay about it and get a guarantee that if the buyer asked for a refund they wouldn't force me to.  The rep said of course they couldn't force me to do anything and because of my exemplary rating, I was entitled to special coverage.  I felt important and protected, so I went through 265 games to clean and inventory, then packed carefully.  There was no way I was going to risk the buyer being unhappy, who would??!  That took me two days, but it was worth it.  When I forked over the $84 dollars to ship it, wiping the sweat from my forehead, I felt the tickle of excitement and pride from my biggest sale.  I was also glad I had estimated the shipping cost accurately.  That sale was so important because I had important bills to pay that I couldn't otherwise.  The relief I felt to send off my best sale, the joy of being done dealing with the games market and being able to pay a couple debts that hung on my shoulders till I was weary, was priceless! I was stunned to see a message from the buyer complaining about the order I had personally hand checked and verified!  I knew immediately that they were going to try to rip me off.  Being that they sold games themselves, evident from their username game_on_boston, I thought they would never rip me off because they'd probably been victimized too.  Plus, I had instructed my bank to not give my money to ebay. Not only did ebay force me to refund the thief, they did so even though the buyer didn't even bother with sending back the order!!!  I watched my case be ignored by the buyer for three days!!!  If you had a problem with an order you spent $1,000 on, would you disregard any information about it?  You would if you were busy selling the mint games you got for top dollar!!!  That lying theif is in their penthouse apartment (this is a fact, shipper informed me), stealing my money, selling my games, ruining my credit and getting my accounts closed. No money, no product.  Ebay took the money from my account without my authorisation, which left me at a negative balance with my bank.  Banks charge fees for overdrafts every day an account is overdrawn.  So now I'm looking at almost a month of daily late charges, my bank account being closed, the loss of my biggest sale, never getting my 265 games back and restrictions on my ebay account?!!!  I'm ready to jump in front of a train, all thanks to games_on_boston but mostly ebay.  Don't do business with ebay.  They'll illegally take your money, help theives steal from you, and ruin your life.",US

I previously had paypal set up to withdraw directly from my bank by providing my account and routing number but this method of payment makes reversing charges a challenge. Using a credit card drastically increases your ability to reverse a charge when there is an issue. Because ebay and paypal is unwilling to assist buyers, at least in my case this is true.  ebay is a great place to find all manners of things. Most of the time when you’re looking for things that are not available through common retail establishments ebay is the next best thing. But BEWARE, ebay’s customer service has really declined over the years. As someone that’s been using ebay since 2006 I’ve seen it. I recently had an instance where the seller cancelled my purchase and stated that payment was never received. However I have confirmation from both paypal and my bank that the seller received payment. The seller never responded to my repeated messages and after googling how to get ebay’s Support on the matter, because ebay hides access to this process behind multiple layers of their website for the sole purpose to make it difficult for anyone who needs support to fine it. Simply put, the seller was a scammer and ebay did nothing to assist me, I was forced to got through a lengthy process of having my finical institution recall the payment. Oh, and paypal was no help either, they told me I need to have it reversed through my bank as well.",US
3196,www.ebay.com,2021-06-12T11:26:30.000Z,1,"Terrible customer service, pathetic policies and no common sense!","Ebay is absolutely the WORST e-commerce type business I have ever dealt with, and that's saying something considering I have dealt with Wish and Alibaba and Rank them better than ebay! I purchased a laptop on ebay on the 10th May 2021. After 3 days of the item still not even marked as shipped, I attempted contacting the seller asking them what was the hold up. I got no response from the seller. Sent them about 4 different messages. Still no reply from the seller. Then I contacted ebay asking them to step in and find out from the seller what on earth is happening because I tried reaching out to them and was unsuccessful in getting a response. Ebay assured me about the ebay money back guarantee and that they cannot contact one customer on behalf of another customer. Apparently their policies forbid them from doing that. Ebay said however they will do an investigation. They found out that the seller hasn't even shipped the item to their hub!!! So logic will tell any person with a brain and common sense-hey if the seller has not responded to any of the buyers messages, the product has not reached eBay hub, then may it just be plausible that we should step in and contact the seller? Unfortunately eBay just doesn't care It is now the 12th June, the so called estimated delivery date of the product and guess what, nothing has arrived!!! The item is still not marked as shipped lol, the seller is still non existent and eBay continues to say its covered by the eBay money back guarantee. The steps they gave me to open up a ""did not receive item issue"" does not work, I had to go do my own research and find out the steps. And when I try to open up the request, it does not work which is even more frustrating. But the real sad part is that a man who I see as my grandad has covid. He may be hospitalized and if he is, there is no funds for him to go to a good hospital. I even told ebay this that I need the money if my grandad has to go to the hospital. They were ""sorry"" to hear this but clearly not sorry enough to do anything about it like issuing me a refund for a product that has not even shipped not ever will because the seller is not bothered to respond to any messages. It was so hard not to swear the for the first 7 messages I sent to eBay. But Ebay can drive even a Saint mad. This is my first time purchasing from eBay and rest assured it is my last!

They place contract work-from-home minimum wage employees as customer support representatives, who have no power to make any changes, take issues into account. Those ebay employees simply have to pass on complaints to management and then there is never any action. Front line support is a joke and only presented in order to give sellers and buyers the impression that ebay cares about their problems. Ebay is very dictatorial and takes nothing into consideration. Their headquarters employees have grown accustomed to knowing that electronic algorithyms and canned endless circle solutions that don't require any live help will allow them to sit and basically do nothing for sellers and buyers.  Their ""Contact Us"" links are a classic game of frustration and even when one is lucky, yes lucky enough to finally escape the perpetual circle of help questions and topics, you just get those front line employees who are not empowered to make any decisions.

The calculated shipping price I charge is exactly what it costs me.  So why is Ebay taking fees for the total payment? Because they can, what are you gonna do about it? They practically own second-hand e-commerce. Ha, Billion dollar company and they hire a tiny indian call center that acts like they hate their job almost as much as they hate talking to you. Good luck dealing with scammers, you can't leave them bad feedback or even keep eBay from digging into your PayPal account when you refuse a refund on an item that the customer broke.",US

It wasn't perfect but it was generally user friendly. In the last 2 years all of that has changed. Different culture altogether - no service, lack of communication prior to systemic changes, dishonesty in consumer relations. Latest: A ""reference number"" on an online issue sent to higher levels for resolution, two days later, turns out to be the conversation id for the phone call! I suppose that it gets the seller off of the line without actually addressing, nor caring to address, the issue but why bother to have a help line? Many issues, many calls and NONE have resulted in any action. Dismissive of the people that make the system work - sellers and buyers - corporate America, isn't it great? I have made my last purchase on ebay and selling will also be in the rear view mirror. There are other better platforms",US

3221,www.ebay.com,2021-06-18T15:49:20.000Z,1,I'M DONE WITH EBAY! Customer Chargebacks are RAMPANT!,"I've been using eBay for over a decade, sold hundreds of items, paid thousands in fees, 100% seller feedback and never had an issue but I notice their rules are completely ridiculous and fees are unprofitable for seller. Also, I listed items here that gets hidden every month from audience. If my listings truly got full audience, eBay wouldn't have to nag me to lower my prices constantly (which in turn is getting pennies on the dollar). They also wouldn't have to nag me to accept offers especially at 50% of the item's cost. They always fine ways to milk money out of you. Also, the scammers on this website are unbelievable. I never had an issue until I sold a digital code, where eBay doesn't CLEARLY specify that it's prohibited. In fact, tens and tens of individual sellers sell codes and upon listing, eBay doesn't say it's not allowed, their help page was confusing. I sold a digital code, buyer left feedback, and I sent the code to him via eBay messages (in eBay's platform). Days later, he files a dispute with his original payment. Upon research, I find out that the buyer was a scummy 12 year old kid who made an account, hid his feedback (yes, they can make feedback private now) so no one could see he only buys digital game codes and then does chargebacks on them. In other words, this buyer preys on sellers yet gets away with it. Imagine a platform where the company cares so little that 12 year olds are on there scamming honest sellers? This is so embarrassing for me. There's no way to leave buyers negative feedback and now they're even allowed to hide their feedback. Also, he's still allowed to have his account after he made a chargeback. EBay refused to help me because I didn't have a tracking number. Apparently, eBay doesn't ""recommend"" selling digital codes but they don't flat out ban it. Yet the buyers are allowed to buy these codes, scam and sellers can't do anything about it. We're living in 2021 and this is how eBay is set up which is unbelievable. Not only that, but eBay's pages are all confusing, their website is different designs, mixed up and completely impossible to find real info. Seller central is a mess. Some of their help pages still say ""Paypal"" this and that yet eBay has ditched Paypal some time ago. This website has been outdated and customer service is useless and won't help if you're scammed. eBay doesn't flag these scammers–both buyer and seller. I reported scammer accounts, nothing was done. Also, the ""local pickup"" concept is very confusing so be careful. If a buyer contacts you to buy your items outside of eBay, but doesn't actually buy it on eBay to ""pick up"", it's an automatic temporary ban on you, eBay will give you a defect, can't sell for two weeks AND eBay will take the final value fee for that item. How does eBay justify this? They have a bot that picks up messages between buyers/sellers and if you end the listing of the product around the time you spoke to the potential buyer, eBay will assume you ""sold it"" even if you didn't (and sold it elsewhere). Lastly, avoid buying from Chinese and foreign sellers. I was scammed by one. The item's shipping time was about a month and it never came. I contacted the seller, but the next thing the seller said was that s/he shipped another one out but refused to give a tracking number for it. I stupidly waited because I thought the seller was honest, but it never happened. I waited and contacted the seller constantly who kept saying the same thing ""hold on, we'll check your order"", which isn't true. I realize the seller purposely delayed just to get out of Paypal's refund window. So basically, Paypal refused to help me (at the time) and I couldn't leave negative feedback for the seller. The seller also continued to sell and wasn't penalized. Paypal is no longer used on eBay but now eBay can directly take money out of my bank account whenever they feel. Sell your stuff anywhere else. There's plenty of other platforms. High fees! They said their fees may be less after leaving Paypal but instead, it's been the same flat 12.5% which eBay can now hold for more interest. It only deposits on ""business"" days, so if you're waiting on that money to pay for shipping or need it immediately, tough luck! I rather just sell on Amazon even though Amazon has plenty of bad buyers too. At least they have a wider audience and Amazon bans buyers with too many returns, cases, disputes, etc. Ebay just lets this happen over and over. If you're a seller, be careful and don't sell to people who have no feedback, new account or hide their feedback. For buyers, ask all questions before buying and do research. If it's too good to be true, then it is. Lastly, how silly are buying scammers on eBay to pull a scam after they provided you their full physical/shipping address, name and everything. So insane!!!!",US

The past 2 years, i was 7/10 packages missing or dellay and when i mean dellay 6or more months. And a lot of them was bad quality, not as subscribe and a lot of mistakes were made or even damaged! Instead of giving a new policy for the buyers because we loose our money for scammers they ban the buyers for buying. I am not going to buy again because they change the policy good for sellers to sell more junk and fake packages and buyers say ""thanks"" or banned!

I have been twenty years with eBay and using PayPal to get paid instantly. I have not given eBay my banking details as they keep requesting, and because of this they are now withholding my payment from a buyer which technically is fraudulent.  Incidentally, I only do eBaying as a hobby and to make a little extra cash, selling stuff that I will never use. Have been with eBay since 2003 but WILL NOT be press ganged or bullied into this managed payments scheme obviously to make eBay richer! PayPal was fine with payments being instant. Now, if your listing ends on a Friday, you will have to wait till the next week to see if your payment has gone through! Again, eBay treating their buyers and sellers like dirt. We must not take it but fight back! You can guarantee that if something is working fine, there will always be some ‘pillock’ to come along and ‘ball’s’ it up! Also it is somewhat amusing when eBay ‘invite’ you to join their managed payments scheme. What they are really saying is this.  If you do not join and do not give us your banking details, then you will not be allowed to sell on eBay! And I do not take kindly to being threatened. I am seventy four years old and do not need this crap and ‘WILL NOT’ take it!! So it looks like ‘Goodbye’ eBay from me. There are other buying and selling platforms on the web, so I and hopefully thousands of other users who refuse to be intimidated, will stick up two fingers to eBay and buy and sell somewhere else. Getting far to big for their boots, and needs to be brought down a peg or two. People power could damage them. And to the small time sellers who are constantly hassled by eBays rules. Do not be taken in! Also, do not be afraid to part Company with them! Don’t let them get you down. Really annoyed by their ‘non’ caring and arrogant attitude. Jonny W.",GB

I refunded a buyer because someone went through and did charge backs on over $10k of gold over multiple accounts.  Refunded a guy and then he turned around and left me a bad review even tho I NEVER SOLD TO HIM. Makes since right?  3. Payment holds left and right.  They will put your money on hold for no reason. I've only been selling on here for two weeks and they have held every. Single. Payment. Over and over. Now I still have $4,000 on hold again because a scammer did a charge back.  Now let me ask you something.  If you sell something and the buyer already has the item. And then loses an ebay case because they can't prove what they claim. Then goes around and does a charge back from their own bank. Who should be punished for this? If you said the buyer then your right! But ebay thinks its the sellers fault. Really? I'm out $4,000 and can't do anything about it and can't even get my item back because the buyer refuses to send it back.   Part of my life's savings gone because ebay is incompetent and should be shut down.  Ebay needs to be shut down. Its a horrible company and as long as they can keep a chunk of the money they don't care who does what.  Also don't buy or sell gold on their. YOU WILL GET SCAMMED NO MATTER WHAT I PROMISE YOU.",US

3368,www.ebay.com,2021-05-21T14:01:51.000Z,1,Sadly eBay is not what it used to be,"Sadly eBay is not what it used to be, it has changed & changed for the worse. Their biased policies & customer service is a joke. I have been using eBay as a private individual for 16 years both buying & selling with generally good experiences.  However a recent sale I made of a package of vintage camera items showed how biased towards the buyer eBay is now & how little they care about the seller. The camera items were listed auction style as a small job lot. There were a couple of interested parties bidding & the camera items sold. The buyer paid promptly & I duly posted the items & left them positive feedback for their prompt payment. However upon receiving the items the buyer claimed that some of the items were faulty. As per eBays guidance & policy I offered them a full refund if they returned the entire package of items. They declined this saying they wanted to keep the items but would accept a partial refund/gesture of good will which equated to just under 40% of the sale price. Seeing as I was in Kent & they were in Scotland I couldn't verify that the items were now indeed faulty. They were working perfectly when I posted them. They were manually operated items not digital & very little could go wrong with them. Again as eBay had advised me I offered a full refund providing they returned the items & I would naturally pay for the return postage. Alternatively I offered them the option to keep the items & I would give them a £10 refund as a gesture of goodwill as the return postage would cost me close to that. They declined both offers again wanting a greater refund but also keeping the items. This went on for several days with me offering them a full refund on 4 separate occasions. Eventually they declined any refund keeping the items which proves to me that they were happy with the items, they were not faulty as claimed but were in fact just trying to con me into giving them some money back. They then left me negative feedback saying ""very bad customer service, avoid at all costs!"" As a long standing eBay member with 100% positive feedback I contacted eBay regarding this asking them to remove this negative feedback. They reviewed the case reading all messages between both parties & agreed that I acted correctly & in accordance with eBays policies & it did appear that I was trying to be conned into refunding the buyer falsely. However they wouldn't remove the negative feedback, all I could do was ask the buyer to revise their decision to leave negative feedback. Naturally a completely pointless exercise but I tried nevertheless. So the buyer keeps the items which they are clearly happy with otherwise they would have accepted the refund. They also get to keep the positive feedback from myself which is clearly now inaccurate & I can't change & I am left with a negative feedback remark & my 100% positive feedback score tarnished. Well done eBay, great customer service! In addition to this farcical mess since eBay partied ways with PayPal sellers now have to wait up to a week to receive their money in their account from eBay, but are expected to post the items immediately eBay confirms the payment has been made. Great decision again eBay, well done!",GB

Bought an item for a few hundred dollars on the competitive  EBay auction site and won. Paid immediately. Nothing from the seller, normally on past auction purchases the seller would issue shipping information and a tracking number soon after the auction closed and payment confirmation received. Heard nothing so sent a fate to the seller 3 days later. Still no response so I placed a negative comment on the seller’s EBay account. This got the sellers attention and the seller advised that the shipment would not be made until I removed the negative comment. A few days later, the seller cancelled the sale and refunded my payment, less 5% being the foreign exchange costs I had to incur. The value of the item was at least two times greater than my winning bid, this is the risk a seller normally takes when selling on a auction, but not on the EBay auction. Turns out that EBay is o.k. with this, they took no action on the seller and closed the case on me once the refund went through, less my foreign exchange loss. So.....sellers if you don’t like the price you received at the auction, just refuse to ship and refund the winner his money back.....buyers, if you believe you made a great purchase, well not so fast, the seller can refund you the purchase price and will suffer no consequences in the way of penalty or the need to pay a breakage fee. EBay is just fine with this, believe it or not. Closed my EBay account a sold my shares in EBay.

Who are these ghost bidders who just bid up on everything I list with no intention of ever paying. Why don't ebay do something about this issue???? I currently have a listing, 2 people bidding on it so up from £35 to £45. Now the highest bidder wants to cancel because they bid too much???? Yet they were in a bidding war. Now you cancel all their bids so my item drops back down to £35. Same person no longer bidding on my item too. Yeah right ebay, dodgy buyers can click their fingers and you'll back them, never the seller. Any more experiences like this and I'll be done with the site for good.",GB
3408,www.ebay.com,2021-05-18T19:33:07.000Z,1,eBay won't even refund due to fraud,"This is from the buyers perspective. At the end of the day, it's the buyers experience that matters the most. It's the buyers who pay the bills. All revenue originates from the buyer. (eBay seems to have trouble understanding this concept). That said, as a buyer I cannot stress enough just how bad eBay's customer service is. I couldn't possibly feel less safe purchasing anything from eBay. eBay doesn't even refund the buyer's money in cases of seller fraud, which might actually be unlawful in most states in the US.  This actually happened to me. I bought a computer graphics card from an eBay seller. Within 3 hours of the purchase, eBay sent me an email informing me that they shut the seller down due to ""suspicious activity."" The email said eBay was ""very sorry for the inconvenience,"" and they instructed me to wait ""180 days for the item to be delivered,"" after which, I'm supposed to ""contact eBay customer support to make a claim."" The word ""refund"" never appeared in the email. I checked eBay and sure enough, the seller no longer existed. I tried to contact eBay's customer support to inform them that waiting 6 months for an item with no tracking number to be delivered from a seller who was shut down for fraud is unacceptable. eBay customer service told me I needed to contact the seller. I told them the seller no longer exists because eBay shut them down. They told me I had no choice but to wait 180 days to make a claim. I disagreed, and I told them that this is not how reputable business is conducted. At that point, I called my bank to dispute the transaction. Within 10 business days I had my money back after I won the dispute. But all this shouldn't have been necessary, and I feel bad for others who get caught up in eBay's scams and don't know how to get their money back. I can't help but wonder why eBay would be willing to lose a customer forever and take a hit to their reputation over such a small amount of money. I can only conclude that eBay is being completely mismanaged. I think bad experiences like this really stick with customers, and I think buying products from an online platform should be a positive and exciting experience. It shouldn't be a scary or traumatizing experience because you never know if you're going to get what you paid for, or whether you'll have enter combat with eBay's hostile customer service just to be treated fairly. Amazon has perfected the online shopping experience by protecting its buyers, probably because they understand that's where the money comes from. Mercari does the same thing eBay does, but it has a fair buy/sell system, a fair and balanced reviewing system, and a refund policy spelled out in black and white that's easy to understand, applies to everyone, and manages to protect both buyers and sellers from scammers. Why couldn't eBay do this? I know why. It's because management thinks eBay's money comes from sellers.  Hey eBay. Your money might come from sellers, but I'm pretty sure the sellers' money comes from buyers, which means eBay's money comes from buyers (um, duh...). So it's probably not in eBay's best interest to scare buyers away by not protecting them with a comprehensible return policy and then treating them terribly with a terrible, unapproachable customer service that treats buyers like criminals for daring to buy from eBay's platform (um, duh...). I mean, I'm no expert, but I think this is a no-brainer. But somehow, eBay hasn't figured out this basic concept for over 15 years. In any case, I got my money back thanks to the dispute I filed with my bank. 'Cause guess what eBay? Banks have rules about transactions involving fraud. And guess what else? I'm never using eBay again.  Bye eBay.",US

3412,www.ebay.com,2021-05-18T11:41:24.000Z,1,eBay is dying a slow death... time to move on.,"I used to sell on eBay until recently when they moved me onto managed payments. I imagined the shift away from Paypal would be better for sellers, however this is not the case at all. The fee's are exactly the same (for now) the only difference is that eBay are now making even more money out of sellers by managing payments themselves. Since moving onto managed payments my sales have dropped 89% (yes really) and for the first time in 17 years I've had to find part time work. The managed payments are just not working for me, I cannot see any other reason my sales are down so much. When I sold via Paypal my money was available instantly, with managed payments you can be waiting upto 5 days for the money to appear in your account and despite only being on managed payments a month or so, I have already ran into many problems including monies claimed to have been sent to my account which have never appeared. eBay's customer service is horrendous, I tried to call them a few times only to be put through to rude ignorant overseas agents who DO NOT understand or deal with your issues. I was working on Paypal Credit paying my loan back at 15% of my sales, I have now had to arrange a huge monthly direct debit to pay this off, and with my sales dying a death, I feel like I've been scammed quite frankly. This is the thanks you get from eBay for being a top rated seller for 17 years, they couldn't care less. If my sales are down 89% this would suggest to me something needs fixing but they are so full of themselves this company, nobody wants to listen to the people who put them where they are today. Currently trying out several other platforms and once my sales are picking up I'll no longer use this company, what a shambles! Would just like to add, if you are on managed payments, I would suggest not posting items you have sold until the money is in your account, or you may find you have sent the item and eBay does not pay you as in my case!",GB

I would like to say that Ebay were helpful in dealing with this issue but I can't.

As a result they treat private sellers as if they were mass market retailers, with a system arbitrated so that, in practice, any buyer can back out of an auction, not pay, return goods or even only partially return goods without any risk of penalty or even negative feedback. That might be good at drawing in buyers, but the system is so prone to abuse it makes the experience absolutely shocking for occasional sellers of higher value items.",GB

When I first turned on the computer, I heard a loud beep. There was an error message that read hit F11 to log into windows. The seller said something was loose after looking at the screenshots I uploaded. The seller offered to show me how to fix this minor problem by opening the case, but I declined when he said the computer would work just fine without the fix. I should have known better.     One month later, the hard drive died. The seller mailed another drive, but I had to pay $90 to have it installed. The computer tech said it wasn't the best drive, but adequate. Three weeks later, however, I got two blue screens while the computer automatically fixed the problem.    The computer continued to periodically freeze until it no longer loaded windows at all. What a bummer. I have had several refurbished computers, but never one that died less than 3 months. For $815 I expected the computer to last much longer.  I contacted the seller about the situation, but he didn't respond. eBay closes feedback comments after 60 days this so the seller behaved as if he has nothing to lose by ignoring me. He has my cash so why should he care if the junk he sold me broke down? I had bought this computer based on the 100% feedback from eBay which now I believe does not really reflect reality.    Worse yet, when I searched for a website for this business, I found a free website that is even formatted for the public to use.    I now have to mail a heavy computer to San Francisco for mechanical repairs. Obviously, the hardware used to build this computer was faulty. Meantime, I had to spend an additional $300 to update my older computer while I wait for this computer to be repaired. Buyer Beware. You just can't trust all these great reviews anymore. If you want a refurbished computer, go local or with one of the major brand companies.",US

The new owner used the wet vac and the cleaning fluid and then contacted eBay to return the item where I was asked to provide proof that the item was as described as the buyer suggested it wasn’t as described (one of the options the buyer can select which will always result in a full refund no matter the details) the decision fell in the buyers favour as they had selected “item not as described” The buyer also contacts their payment provider and cancels the payment , at this point my £180 wetvac is with the “buyer” along with a full refund and no opinion or defence from my side considered. The wetvac does arrive back at my address but used and damaged, when I contact eBay about this on more than 6 occasions my concern is ignored and pushed around , eBay suggest they will get back to me in a number of days which they do via an email that states the case is closed and it’s an email which doesn’t have the option for me to reply.

Nothing made scene but eBay stated the item was delivered to a valid us address,I do not know what is that even mean. Learned my lesson with $30, could been lot worst, there was time when I spent a lot more.  but time to take a break, time to think twice before purchasing. There are lot of other sources of purchase.

Every sale becomes an anxiety ridden coin flip, during which you have no idea whether or not you’re going to actually wind up losing money or not using their service. The last time I used eBay as a seller, I sold a camera gimbal for 300 dollars. I used all of the eBay recommended seller and shipping preferences, however they decided after the fact that shipping using UPS meant my shipping rate was not fixed (even though UPS was listed by them as a shipping partner and they had set a rate for my item that I paid in full). I wound up paying for 230+ to eBay with seller fees and additional shipping fees and made about 50 bucks on my item. It was absolutely ridiculous and unfortunately not the first time something like this happened. They will constantly tack on fees after a sale is made and take the money without even notifying you as a seller if you have a PayPal or bank account attached to your eBay account for payments. I advise you to be extremely careful and disconnect all bank and PayPal accounts immediately after receiving a payment and then pay eBay fees using the one time payment feature after the fact.

3514,www.ebay.com,2021-05-07T23:30:14.000Z,1,EBay is the most dishonest,"EBay is the most dishonest, deceptive, and unprofessional company I have ever dealt with.  I initially started as a buyer; however, in April 2021, I decided to start selling on their site.  When a buyer makes a purchase, you are able to purchase the label on eBay’s site.  Therefore, on April 24th, I shipped an item to a buyer; however, the postal office returned the item to my home and informed me that I needed to pay $49.00.  I contacted eBay and an agent (with permission from her supervisor) informed me that I could go ahead and pay the $49.00 and eBay will reimburse me once the delivery is confirmed.  When the delivery was confirmed, I contacted eBay for my reimbursement and was told that an investigation needs to happen to investigate why the agent informed me of that.  I was further told and I will get an email of the result of the investigation by May 7th.  May 7th came and I did not receive an email from eBay; therefore, I decided to call to get the status of my reimbursement.  The agent that I spoke with pretended that she did not know what I was talking about and asked the same questions.  I was told that I would not get a reimbursement.  At that point, I requested for the situation to be escalated.  The Escalation Dept. requested for call be back within three hours since they needed to listen to the conversation between the agent and myself that had transpired on April 24th.  After three hours, I received a call back informing me that the agent did indeed engaged in a oral contract with me; however, eBay will breach the contract by declining to pay me.  I closed out my account (since Maya Angelo said, when a person show you who they are believe).  I have written a demand letter to eBay and will mail it to the corporate office.  Afterwards, I will file a small claim in California Civil court.  Oral contract status of limitation is two years.  Do allow these company to use, abuse, and misappropriate you, we need to held them accountable for their improprieties.  I was also advised to file a complaint with BBB.",US

On May 1st I get an email from Ebay item removed and seller as well. I was order number 117 with 95% sold. Now if this was a scam can Ebay  not detect such items and block buyers from paying.   The kicker with Ebay is lack of any support: Wait till the item arrives which is May 15th, and if not received see this link for more help!  To date no tracking number has come.  Second no way to contact the seller as Ebay removed them. Third one cannot contact Paypal as well.  Thankfully I can contact my credit company and inform them who provides more help than Ebay plus the community forums.   Honestly, Amazon is going put Ebay out of business at some point in time. Why because Amazon provides easy help when issues occur.  With Ebay one has waste half a day searching for help then finally give up.

I advised Yorlding who told me that they were sorry and to return the item for a full refund which was later confirmed by Ebay who told me to print out a return label to cover the postage cost.  Yorling also contacted me to advise that they do not provide return labels and I would need to pay for the return to Shanghai myself and upon receipt would refund my money! By now I had no confidence that this Chinese Company would honor their commitment to refund or even acknowledge receipt of the returned item and cover the postage cost!

3541,www.ebay.com,2021-05-05T10:34:31.000Z,1,A terrible change,"I’ve been a user of eBay since 2013 and the selling experience has, in most cases, always been a fluid one. But with the new changes to private seller fees/payouts in 2021 and the separation from PayPal, that experience has become largely hindered. There is absolutely no reason why an electronic transaction should be held for ‘processing’ and take two working days to be paid, other than a large retailer seeking more cash flow to satisfy its own greed. Netting interest by delaying payouts from its millions of sellers means it can capitalise even further from an increase in users, but it comes at a cost - a clunky user experience. Sellers are now forced to wait for a confirmed payment before sending items, meaning that postage/collections has/have become slower. This largely impacts the purchasing experience, too.  I don’t know about you, but I’m going to be seeking online alternatives away from what is already a platform known for price gauging and minimum customer services.",GB

I sold an item 3 days ago, have paid out for postage and yet I still do not have my money, as I didn’t understand their new policy.

Your new hub is not supported on our phones - didn’t you know that!? Let me ask you a question: how much did you pay the idiot who’s idea it was to change the interface and why? What did you do about the PayPal? The payment that used to take less than a minute, will now take 10 days?  Wow! Are you ditching PayPal to grab their earnings? aren’t you already reach enough? Need more money in the time of PANDEMIC? Shame on you! eBay supported me and my family in the most difficult times when we had no money and had to sell our personal belongings to survive!  And we respected you, paid your fees on time; created more shops - made more money for you every day.  Because everything in this world goes both ways and especially in business.

The items missing were pictured, and this seemed completely intentional based on the sellers responses. In other words a scam. Opened case after giving seller time to help, and after realizing that this sounded more and more scam-like by the day. 4/16, Celine Grace with eBay tells me she closed the case in my favor, processed a refund for $475, and that I can keep or dispose of the item.  This is a large item, the size of a small table, sitting on top of my kitchen table, so I gave the seller about a day to reach out to ask for it back--he never did so (in fact he never did during this entire process). Considering the sellers previous comments and handling of the situation, and that I was told to keep or dispose of the item (and I was sick of it being on my table), I just went ahead and gave the item away. 4/18 I contact eBay to check status of refund. Jennifer tells me that the refund was not processed yet, but that it will be in time. She said I must wait until the case is closed on 4/28 and contact eBay immediately. But it is just a matter of waiting to receive this refund. I expressed that this is rent money, I purchased this item to resell it not to lose $500 on it, and I was told there's nothing they can do until April 28. 4/28 I contact eBay to receive my refund. I am told that I am not eligible for a refund since I did not return the item. I cited the chat transcripts, and provided excerpts to the agent Rannie Mae. I was told that I was given misinformation, but she does see that the other representative(s) promised me a refund. She submits an appeal from me. 4/30 I have not heard about this appeal, so I call them and ask them to address this. They say they submitted an appeal. A few hours later I receive an email that states: ""We weren't able to give you a refund"" ""After reviewing this case, we decided to keep the original outcome."" This case was filed by someone who identified themselves on the phone as ""1-32014818xxxx"". 4/30 I called eBay and spoke with Daniel (1-32020993xxxx), he said this is NOT the same department as appeals. I was told this is a specialized department because of an agent issue, due to what they promised. We will see what happens. By the way, Daniel was incredibly respectful, sympathetic, and helpful. I could tell he took the time to make sure this issue goes where it needs to. Long story short, eBay allowed someone to scam me, supported them through scamming me, and even pulled the age old trick on behalf of the scammer and told me to ""wait until the case is closed"" to receive my refund.

But the real bonus is that there are so many bargains to be had - because you're able to shop around through so many different suppliers, you can often buy an item at about half the usual retail price.

We bought an electronics device on Ebay (brand new) because we read in the product description that it included a manufacturer's warranty. Like many other consumers, we're aware that electronics tend to fail quickly and easily despite gentle handling. On the 30th day after we'd received the product, it failed. We reached out to the seller who refused to help us. So we went to Ebay. We provided Ebay screenshots of the product page advertising a manufacturer's warranty. Ebay wouldn't budge. After several back-N-forth emails, Ebay sent us to the seller's website OFF Ebay. The seller's email address refused to accept incoming email (our email provider sent us proof of this). We shared all of this with Ebay. Ebay's customer support supervisors wrote us (email) that it is their policy not to get involved after 30 days from the Ebay delivery estimate date. So even if it takes a long time for you to get your product, if it's outside the estimated delivery period, you're on your own. We had this happen with another product. Ebay wouldn't help us even though we'd never received the product. Ebay's last email to us was that the case is now closed since the product failed outside their 30-day return period. They refuse to address the false advertising claim that the product has a manufacturer's warranty which the seller refuses to provide us information about.  Worse yet, when we left an honest review of our experience with this seller who'd emailed us a request for a positive review a DAY after we'd received the electronic item but who then refused to communicate with us once the item failed on day #30, Ebay removed our review. We asked how we could edit the review (we hadn't broken any laws or used any profanity or false claims) so that it would go public as a warning to other buyers. Ebay refused to accept any edit of the review. So Ebay also CENSORS negative reviews to artificially inflate sellers' trust scores. This distorts buyers' perception of the reliability of both products and sellers in the Ebay marketplace. The next step for us is to file a complaint with our state's Attorney General Consumer Fraud department. Ebay shouldn't permit ads to advertise warranties if the products have none or sellers can refuse to forward any information about them. Ebay also shouldn't be removing negative reviews if writers are following the law and can corroborate with hard evidence all their assertions.",US

This company is like a sinking ship. So everybody onboard will drown.  They are committing open frauds with buyers as well as sellers. Its policies are junk. It does not offer protection on any of your purchases.  I recently bought an item.  Unfortunately, it was coming from China. I was provided with a tracking no and date of delivery. The item supposed to be delivered after a month. Every time i tracked item it showed the item was shipped. when the delivery date passed i sent an email to know about status of my order. i got an email from scammer's bay that the tracking no. has been updated. I was startled a bit. i entered the new tracking no. to check status. To my surprise the status showed that the item was delivered 15 days prior to the due date. But i didn't receive anything. I emailed them agian that i didn't recieve my item. The seller seem to me scammer here as well. He just provided the tacking No. and out of the game. The scammer's bay has no customer service line. So no live support exist. I asked scammer's bay to step in for help but in vain. everytime i got error message ""sorry system hick upp try again later"". But i later found that they were receiving messages on their end. i went to the Usps and gave them trackng no. they told me that the order was delivered to a wrong address gave me copy of the order. Since the scammer's bay system was out of order. so my request for never fulfilled. I recieved an email "" your request has been closed due to  inactivity. The next email i received was that if i need refund i need to provide a copy of incindent report from local Police Station. THE END.  Its a scammer's bay. Stay Away from it.

I contacted the shipping company,  FedEx confirmed their driver delivered it to a wrong address and asked to contact Ebay for refund.  When I contacted ebay, their customer service started treating me suspiciously as if I took the delivery and pretending I didn't.

So the eBay points for credit card spending is very enticing and it's a lot of fun, but I would recommend avoiding eBay's credit card as much as possible. eBay to begin with is a company that has really slide down into the depths of incompetency and corruption. Ripping off it's infamous long time seller base in favor of competing more with Amazon and cut throat speeds.  However the credit card is a whole other mess of hell. The credit card log in site is buggy, doesn't load certain things often, shows certain statements as ""unavailable"", and recently the last straw for me was being double charged on a monthly auto-pay payment. Their customer service is CHAT BOT ONLY, there is no phone number, so another red flag. The rep was polite but claimed they only saw one charge from their end to my bank. Said I would just have to call my bank. Well, I did, and right away the bank opened up a dispute claim because it was obviously charged twice and eBay / Synchrony was lying about it.  How does a credit card site charge you twice for a literal AUTO deposit? I think it's bad web design to the core. These people have clearly hired the lowest bidder B team devs you could find in or out of the U.S. to be the classic eBay cheapskates they are, and as a result their website is so buggy it somehow leads to erroneous charges being triggered by the system.

I was then told it was already shipped , Ya that's why to call back the next day to give time for it to be shipped !

I called fed-X and asked were was the shipping label from ? They said from Home Depot ?? That's called a drop shipment . that means ONE, The seller never had one left to start with . or TWO the seller was never involved to start with ??

The buyer's account was later banned for scamming-related activities, yet my money was never returned. 2 - I put in the correct address and their system used the default address instead. The process of simply changing the shipping address should be very easy a matter of minutes after the purchase, but no, eBay wants you to cancel the entire order, eat the charge for 3-5 days, and just double how much you pay up front for the item. 3 - Their support takes 10 minutes to reply to you but if you don't respond in under a minute they'll kick you and make you wait in line again.

3689,www.ebay.com,2021-04-15T08:30:57.000Z,1,Useless,Well if you think eBay could not get any worse!!!....you thought wrong they have introduced managed payments basically taking away your right to choose you way of payment and receiving a payment if you are unfortunate to have sold an item through them!!. Before you were paid by PayPal into your account often immediately the buyer paid for your item you then sent your item.Now they keep the payment from you for minimum 48hrs before then sending you an email telling you it's been sent to your registered bank account informing you it can take 0-4 days to clear .. unbelievable my bank has instant clearance for payments to my account so now it can take up to 6 days after you actually sell an item before you see any money... meanwhile your buyer waits for his item to be sent.... account closed for sure better using the many FREE platforms now to sell anything as eBay are not robbing every seller blind with fees,GB

I wanted it on this date as it's my daughter's birthday, so I paid for the item plus the £7 postage. Once I had paid for the item, it was then telling me that the item would arrive AFTER 1/4/21 (and I also kept a screenshot of that screen). I emailed the seller and they said it would arrive on 31/3/21. It didn't - and to cut a very long story short - they had sent it to a location a long way from where I live. They refused to refund me and I raised with Ebay, asking for a refund for both the item and the postage (as I still haven't received it to this day). Ebay staff clearly can't understand basic English because they refunded me for the lamp but not the postage and after several emails from me about this, are now ignoring me.  The second issue was when I left negative feedback for a seller and the seller emailed me to say that if I changed my feedback, they'd give me a refund. They didn't give me a refund and ignored all my subsequent emails. I raised this with Ebay on the Resolver website, and Ebay ignored me. In the past, I've found the majority of sellers on Ebay to be honest, l but the last 2 experiences I have had had put me off using Ebay again. Maybe it's just bad luck but I don't need the hassle.

I am mediately reached out to the seller requested a return label and a refund and included pictures of his listing and the charm I received. Seller offered me a 2  dollar refund Then seller offered me five dollars and I could keep the charm I paid $17.85 for the charm. I reached out to eBay who told me he had to send me a return label by April 12. On April 12 I received another email from eBay telling me that they put my case on hold giving the client until the 17th to respond.

The seller he’s buying his time and eBay is protecting him they do not offer buyer protection they are hoping that I’ll just give up I know I am not responsible for the return shipping. eBay’s customer support told me in an email that if I had to pay for the shipping the seller would have to reimburse me he won’t reimburse me for the charm he’s not gonna reimburse me for shipping.

I looked around for a bit but ended up finding the item cheaper elsewhere by usings Google lens. Logged out of eBay & that was it. The next day I noticed eBay had emailed me saying ""Your eBay account has been permanently suspended because we noticed activity that we believe is a risk to our community."" Date and time of second email? 3/11/21 9:41am, FOURTEEN minutes after I created my account. It also said that outstanding seller fees would be charged to my payment on file... except I didn't have any payment on file because I never attempted to buy or sell anything. I immediately assumed it was a scam/phishing email so I exited out of it and logged into my eBay account on a different device. A message popped up basically saying the same thing, that I was banned & owed them money. I start a convo with the chatbot & it suggested I check my eBay messages, if there isn't a message from eBay in the inbox then it isn't legit. Sure enough there was a message. I go back to the chatbot & i end up going rounds with that thing getting nowhere. So I start emailing them... & email again... & Even more emails, for about 2 weeks plus googling & calling every single number I could find online, can not get ahold of them. I rarely get on my Twitter but finally I got the bright idea to start tweeting them & they responded asking me to dm them with my address and some info. They ended up saying they couldn't help me because they couldn't verify my identity... & That's due to the fact I didn't have an address in my account because I have NEVER tried to buy or sell anything. But amazingly I ended up finally receiving an email back from them. ""we do not make decisions like this lightly so we have spent some time reviewing your case .. Your account has been suspended because the pattern of activities we have witnessed present a risk to our eBay community."" I replied with screenshots of the emails and times asking them to explain how it's possible that in FOURTEEN MINUTES I listed an item for sale & had enough time for a buyer to claim that I cheated them? What is the item your alleging I tried to sell? What was the cost of the item? How did I create a suspicious pattern in FOURTEEN MINUTES? Do you really think FOURTEEN MINUTES is enough time to be considered as not taking something lightly when reviewing a case? HOW DID AAAALLLL OF THESE THINGS TAKE PLACE IN FOURTEEN MINUTES?? Response back, ""Unfortunately, we will have to keep that information to ourselves as risk detection is an internal procedure. All we can say is we are unable to see future in this partnership and thus it would be better to part ways."" & They stopped responding to my emails after this. I don't care if I never get unbanned, I could never consider using eBay after this. I want to know what really happened! Why aren't they trying to receive payment if they claim I owe them?

I live near the border, and, after a month that i was waiting for my package to arrive, i decided to contact this guy. He gave me an aliexpress tracking code. Then i've checked the price he put on ebay, it was 5 times higher, than the one on aliexpress. So, at that point i gave him a bad feedback, even because the package arrived with custom duties and, later than expected. Ebay decided to remove my feedback for no reason, not even telling me why, and i was polite. So, short story, he is still selling on the platform, shipping stuff from china and not from germany as described, and i'll avoid this site, after 10 years of buying and selling on it. see ya never!",IT

I deserve that, was rude at end and being blocked I deserved, but the initial banning I did NOTHING wrong but bid on several items. I can only guess as to why they sniped my bidding attempts. Someone who works there banned me so they could get the same items I bid on without bidding more than me. It's just a guess but it's the only thing that makes any kind of sense I can think of so far.

So, I bother to call eBay.. the only line they are supposedly ""answering"", the fraud line... and go through hell's 7th circle. Eventually I self sort to, ""an agent will be with you"" only to be routed back into contact with a similar self-sorting automaton.  That process quickly takes you to their hang up! Basically one giant ""go away"" machine...they want no, and designed a system that accepts no, input. Customers are extraneous complications whose variability cannot be handled. They have taken the very concept of ""human"" completely out of their system.",US

If this had been at my old address I could have got my item back. Ebay argued this as I told them they was responsible for this. They seem to have control over your bank account, you have no where to put a dispute in at all. So I have lost £118 worth of top and they have you where they want you.

He said  ""you didnt mention anything about unregistered address when you posted the item"" ""I want the service book sent to the address provided""  Our answer ""Sorry we can't dispatch replacement one to unregistered address again. We can only dispatch it to registered address if you give us. We need to wait an update from royal mail until next week Tuesday. Because we have dispatched your orginal order. if you do not received it until Tuesday. We will refund you Thanks"" We contacted with eBay, representative checked everything tracking numbers, messages, screenshots and buyer address from ""royal mail address finder"" and closed the case with our favour received email too from ebay. ""Case is now closed We reviewed this request and have closed it without any refund to the buyer. The case will not affect your seller performance."" After that by chance we checked the case and realized that another representative changed the desicion to buyer favour without any notification or explanation to us also there was no any further information. We contacted again they just saying sorry sorry we changed the desicion based on the tracking information because item didn't delivered to buyer. THIS IS A BIG INCONSISTENCY  BECAUSE FIRST DESICION HAS BEEN TAKEN TOO BASED ON THE SAME TRACKING INFORMATION. They don't understand that is not our fault. UNFAIRNESS Because the postage issue caused by buyer's address is not correct invalid.  Buyer must be responsible with this. FINALLY,  IF EBAY CHANGED THE DESICION WHY THEY DIDN'T NOTIFIED US WITH EBAY MESSAGE OR EMAIL / PHONE CALL. THEYJUST COLLECTED MONEY FROM OUR ACCOUNT WITHOUT OUR PERMISSION OR NOTICE.

The following actions are not allowed: -- Returning an item other than the original item received I have never done this or have been accused of this. -- Using or damaging an item and then returning it I have never done this or have been accused of this. -- Making false claims, such as: --- Returning an item with the reason that it wasn’t as described when it was described accurately. If I have said an item was not as described the seller has apologized and accepted the refund. --- Saying an item wasn’t received when it was delivered I have never done this or have been accused of this. Based on my true and accurate statements I have not done any of the above. I have returned items for not being as described. However, my statements were true and accurate. The sellers have apologized and accepted the return themselves. Funny, eBay can’t give a direct reason for the suspension or examples of any type of abuse.  Obviously, because there isn’t any abuse. I would not have all positive feedback (635) if there was an issue with my buying or selling. I understand you e-mail pertains to buying not selling. The sellers would have left neutral feedback with their feedback concerns (if there had been any issues). I am just writing this as your claims have absolutely no merit. I am only concerned with receiving my refund for item xxxxxxxxxxxx once the seller receives it. The tracking number for the return is xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. This was shipped back yesterday. Otherwise, I will file fraud as the return was accepted. Finally, please stop sending e-mails regarding offers or items ending. Get it together on your end. eBay has lost sellers and buyers and eBay is down 30% to 40% year to year. You can Google that!!!!!  eBay’s claims against me are false and there are no examples of any abuse as it never occurred.",US

THEN you can get your money back. If you do not do it this way and just resell, ebay will not refund you your money for the posting.  ALSO. Ebay does not let you leave any back feedback for the person that ghosted you. They give them two strikes, but that doesn't stop the scammers from making a new email address and ebay account. It's so terrible.  I am never using ebay again. I have been using it for many many years too. I ended up selling my laptop locally within 5 minutes posting on facebook marketplace.

I sold an item that was returned both beat up and damaged, and with a completely different component than what I sent.  I opened a case, was denied by eBay, appealed it with a detailed description and photos, and that appeal was also denied. At this point I'd spent about 2 hours on the phone with their very apathetic outsourced reps. After losing my appeal, eBay not only took the refund from me, but they DOUBLE charged it!! So, to sum up, I have been screwed over by the buyer, had the original payment taken away, and then ANOTHER full refund taken from me, to add insult to injury. At this point, I spent probably another 3 hours on the phone with eBay reps, I was passed around numerous times, and finally after repeating the issue about 5 times, and on the verge of tears, the rep finally said they understood, and that I would receive a ""manual correction"" refund within 3-7 business days. And here we are almost 3 weeks later...no refund!!! But, they are super quick to charge and debit you for your seller fees, they don't miss a beat there. So in essence, if you are a seller, good luck. It's become a platform for rampant fraud, the buyer will win every time, and you will be left SOL.

I am able to continue providing my services, so long as I change my password. I have expressed to them that I will not under any circumstance change my password, as the security issue they detected was false, and I was in another state.

I told them that if I am required to change it, then i will be l will be conducting my business elsewhere. I pulled my listing while on the phone, and to no avail...cannot use my old password.

The split from paypal left ebay without any arbitration system, and no common sense. The loser is the seller every time.The managed payments and return system locks your account till return is resolved.If you make sales after a return is opened the funds are UNAVAILABLE they are taken for the return. If you want to ship anything after this return NO FUNDS.No shipping with ebay discount And your buyer return may take weeks or get lost? Ebay can go right to your bank account if you try to cancel these unshippable orders. They can bypass paypal or any payment form and take money from your deposit account and drain it at will.So I closed my account.Closed off bank access totally. Then even when empty box is returned ebay pays the buyer  and you get to pay even when return was a scam. No questions asked.If ebay wants money you dont have and you as a seller ask for a payment plan ? They say that is only for buyers.With all the other ways to sell I do not need Ebay any more.",US

3903,www.ebay.com,2021-03-19T11:36:26.000Z,1,My worst seller experience ever (crunchy story below),"It took me some time to review the platform, but I really have to report such an awful customer experience somewhere. Enjoy the read: I had an eBay account I've seldomly used to buy a few items I couldn't find elsewhere. I also sell a few items on Rakuten and Marktplaats. As a result, I wished to replicate my 10 announces on eBay for further visibility, it's usually good for an e-commerce platform having more sellers. I barely had time to create 4-5 announces as my account got suspended and I'm contacted by eBay, probably because I haven't filled the VAT or Serial number infos as I'm a casual seller. While their fraud engine is definitively overly sensitive, I reassure you that the story does not end here (wouldn't be crunchy :)). So I receive a lovely/friendly email :> from their customer fraud team. As a result, I send a message to their customer service to kindly unlock my account and they ask for quite sensitive information, such as an official identity document as well as a proof of address (water or electricity bill). As those are quite sensitive information for a random e-commerce platform, I express some concerns and get the below response: """""" Thank you for writing back to eBay regarding your eBay account. My name is Malav S and I will help you further with resolving the issue. I completely understand that your hesitation to share your personal information or documents with us. Please be assured, these are normal verification process during initial selling or bidding activity. However, I am sharing information that will help you to understand why we are asking for the same. The safety of the eBay marketplace and our members' security are our top concerns. For that reason, we require eBay members to always provide valid and complete contact information. This enables effective communication between eBay members and between eBay and its members. If we are unsure about the accuracy or authenticity of a member's contact information, we will often require the member to provide documents to verify such information. As explained in our previous email, we are asking you to send us copies of documents that will confirm some of the contact information you've given us. I'm afraid we won't consider your account for reinstatement until we receive the requested documents. We look forward to receiving your documentation so that we can resolve this matter as soon as possible for you. I appreciate your patience and co-operation in this matter. eBay Trust & Safety """""" In the meanwhile, I've found that their fraud engine correlates two sources of information to detect banned accounts: IP address, session cookie, physical delivery address, phone number, payment method, and email. As a result it becomes quite tricky to continue using the platform even with a new account. So I decide to provide both documents with a watermark hiding information they don't need to know such as BSN or other official ids. And now ... here one of the craziest things I experienced in my twenty years of Internet user life. I've sent all of my details at 2 .p.m. and at 2.11 p.m. I receive the below answer from the platform employee Malav S, who was particularly keen to grab my official documentation: """""" I really appreciate your plans to do business on eBay. I have reviewed all the documents that you have provided. We’ve thoroughly investigated your account behavior and would like to share that your account was suspended as it exhibits risk to eBay and to its community. To ensure the safety of the eBay community, we may suspend certain accounts based on their account activities. We carefully weigh the risks involved with allowing users on our site. We found your account to pose risk that no longer justifies a continuing relationship with eBay. Therefore, we have determined that it is in our mutual best interest to part ways. This decision includes all accounts that you use on the site. Any and all accounts that are used to circumvent our decision will also result in suspension. Please note that we never encourage customers to open a new account to avoid the restrictions because when you open new accounts, they can also be suspended or restricted. For your account, there is no appeal for this decision. I understand you would like to continue to sale on our site, but from this point forward, in order to conduct business on the internet, you'll have to find a different platform. I know this may not have been the answer that you were hoping for, but this is our final decision. We highly appreciate your co-operation and understanding in this matter. """""" So to summarize, eBay insists on grabbing sensitive information and gives you a **** 10 minutes after you submit them ""reviewed,"" ""investigated"". Really such an answer to a customer deserves to be exhibit. Cheers eBay :)",NL

I never thought I'd get tired of selling on this platform but the site feels old and tired. Auctions are a thing of the past, nobody has the patience to wait until 7 days for the ""auction"" to end when there are no bidders! Unless it's Buy It Now I don't bother. The Boomer-friendly app freezes up a lot and most buyers tend to be either scam artists or aging Gen Xers or Baby Boomers afraid of new technology. There are so many better platforms out there like Mercari, Etsy or Poshmark. It's a waste of time listing on ebay, hardly anyone below the age of 50 shops there anymore. The only time I go to ebay now is to delete items I've listed but sold elsewhere. Ebay is dead in the water. And the returns! Out of the few items I do sell, you can count on one jerk clicking ""return request."" Knowing how ebay is friendly to scammers, the buyer will claim he/she never got it (though USPS says it was) or ""defective"" (buyer broke it but claims it was me). Ebay, being blind, deaf, and dumb, says I have to accept the return AND pay for the return shipping, even if my listing says NO RETURNS. That's right, y'all. Ebay thinks all sellers have money like Amazon, with limitless funds to reimburse buyers.  Before ebay divorced Paypal, I was so mad at ebay for charging me automatically for a buyer's return that I filed a claim with Paypal. Because Paypal has a brain, I got justice and some money back. They are a competent company, which is why ebay had to dump them.  With so-called ""managed payments,"" things have gone from bad to worse. Ebay refuses to pay sellers for weeks until the buyer ""clears"" it. Unbelievable. It's not like Mercari, where buyers have only 3 days - ebay lets a buyer sit on it for weeks. As a result, sellers are fleeing ebay in droves. Sorry scam buyers, but if no one is left around to scam, you're out of business, too.",US

Even I saved enough evidence, it cannot protect me from buyer fraud. eBay protects those scammers as well. They can claim “item not as described” many days after they received it and they can make multiple claims! That’s what happened to me, buyer first claimed she didn’t received the item, after I updated tracking again (she already had tracking and showed delivered) and after the claimed was closed she started another claim saying item not as described. She said I scammed her and upload a picture with cheap hand sanitizer. WTH! I tried to show eBay I’m innocent by providing packing videos, no one looked at it. I tried to email them, they never answer my questions. What’s more interesting is each time a different person replies to the same email thread but they don’t know what’s going on. I spent a lot of time dealing with this nonsense and all buyer has to do is one click. If you ever encounter buyer fraud, trust me, you cannot do anything. eBay will keep ignoring you until you give up. You’ll lost both money and your stuff. If you ever google eBay buyer fraud, there are so many posts about this. You basically have to accept the junk buyer returned and try to file a police report to fight with eBay.

But I am choosing one thing in particular that is glaringly obvious and it will only get worse as buyers realize eBay is mainly out for their liking.  In the case of my situation, me being the seller, a buyer can seem to do anything they want.  eBay upholds this “money back guarantee” as a way to lure anyone and everyone knowing they could literally buy anything and get their money back no matter what happens.   First thing from my own experience this has happened on multiple occasions is if you ship an item out, let’s assume you take pride in packaging, love the way a bubble wrapped product looks basking in it’s own glory.  You weigh it and measure it then sure enough print the label to ship this item you took care of from one phase to the next.  You then take it to the post office where you say your goodbye and send it on it’s way.  Hoping for the five star feedback to follow soon after.  A month goes by, tracking doesn’t update.  The buyer is sending you messages worrisome in ways but really we all know they don’t have to be.  As a seller, it’s stressful because I want the person buying to be satisfied with the purchase and to receive what they ultimately made their mind up to get.  But the tracking doesn’t update?  All EBay will tell you is to consult with the postal carrier.  If you insured it, good luck on the fight to get that money returned to you.  And if the buyer actually received said item I can’t imagine they would admit it considering they just got their money back by EBay and are free to do whatever they please.   Another experience I’ve had where I’ve felt I had been taken advantage of in the retail world is setting up preorder auctions.  Buyers love to preorder items or do they?  Surely some of them do of course.  But others from my experience just don’t like to read the auctions.  Thinking EBay will side with you for what you clearly put in your auction title and description?  Well, I clearly made it visible so if the buyer didn’t read it it’s on them and there is no cancellation you say?  Nope, none of it matters.  You could list your auctions correctly and EBay will still side with the buyer. Again these are my own experiences.  Fighting up and down back and forth phone calls and emails time and time again with EBay for the same result to happen.  Siding with the buyer and they will get the refund they requested.  Don’t say I didn’t warn you, sell at your own risk!",US

Their situation and risk is worse than mine. Unprofitable: My profit ended up about 12$ (It was suppose to be 35$). Huge fees Horrible: And when user try to refund you there is given a request that you as a seller should refund all first options indicate refunding and the last not. Even default option is to refund everything. Besides, domestic shipping is not your country that you live in or you are registered as. It depends on Ebay server that you registered in P.S I tried to explain and give client as many options as possible on how to make that game work. Apparently, client had other intentions and communication was useless. I refused to let Ebay to step into ( as I had this ability) for multiple reasons but highly suggest it if you have valuable items ,more money involved and feel injustice . It may be worth trying.  My lesson learned : Ebay stands for buyer not seller",LT

I was told on the phone the invoice had been cancelled and no charge would be taken. The following week I was charged and upon ringing the customer service (a service which is hard enough to get hold of) they had no recollection of this conversation and no notes on my account (despite this being something asked to be done). Now with a child's birthday approaching and no help given other than my appeal has been logged, which I need to wait around to hear back from, this has been a truly awful service (especially as after telling me the complaint had been logged I was told bye and hung up on)... By the looks of the reviews this company has received, I can confirm it is not only buying which this company has issues with but also their selling as well. Avoid at all costs as other more reliable companies are available without being scammed.",GB

I'm considering deleting my Ebay account and selling and buying elsewhere. There is zero protection for sellers. Buyers can return anything for any reason whatsoever and it costs the seller over and over again! You can set up your account to ""no returns accepted"" all you want but in reality buyers can always get a refund. I sell a lot of clothes. My descriptions are very detailed  (color of the item, sleeve style and length, materials, pattern, neckline, etc. even though most of this is obvious from the photos). I provide measurements and as many photos as possible. Just in the last month I have had to accept many returns on items that didn't fit the buyer. It has cost me over $100 in return labels and refunding original shipping costs! On top of that I pay Ebay $60 a month + 12% of all my sales. For what? There's no seller protection. Ebay used to protect their sellers, now they do not!! And now we can't leave buyers negative feedback? WHY? Sometimes we deal with buyers who are rude, vulgar, pushy, abusive, unreasonable and scams. So why shouldn't we have the option to leave a buyer negative feedback. Not all buyers are sunshine and roses. There are other platforms out there to sell my items that will not allow buyers to open an item not as described case to get a FULL refund (including original shipping) just because an item doesn't fit. If I make a mistake I'm perfectly fine with losing a few dollars to correct it but if I include measurements for clothing it is the buyers responsibility to make sure that item will fit or don't buy used clothing online!! KNOW YOUR MEASUREMENTS. CHECK MEASUREMENTS IN DESCRIPTIONS OR ASK FOR MEASUREMENTS!! I know my measurements and always ask for them and have never bought an item that didn't fit. It's not that hard. Ebay takes so much of my money just for me to lose more since they can't protect sellers at least a little. I used to love Ebay and recommend it to everyone. Now I've noticed a lot of people are no longer using Ebay and I guess I won't be either. If it wasn't for sellers Ebay would be nothing but yet our word or opinions mean NOTHING.",US

It also used to have reasonable rates for sellers. It has declined over the years and is much less fun and useful for both sellers and buyers.  For sellers, you now get penalized with a 10% selling fee + 10% charge on shipping you charge. And that's before paypal fees. Additionally, if you use their promoted listings, there are extra charges on top of that. Also Ebay has taken away the ability to pay by check, further increasing the cost of doing business for both sellers and buyers. Promoted listings were created by the marketing department to make up for Ebay's poor overall marketing practices over the years resulting in a declining base of Ebay customers.  For Buyers, there are steadily diminishing returns and fewer sellers to buy from. 2% cash back in Ebay bucks turned into 1% and now will turn into 0.0% in April to reward customer loyalty.  Sometimes Ebay offers promotions and coupons.  They work if you can purchase something in a very short window of time. Too often however they expire before you can shop for those specialty items. 3rd party coupons have never worked, so be wary of those scams.Additionally, their customer service is not U.S. based and often has customer support with marginal English skills. So, in short, its an additional pain if there is a problem.  If intelligent and customer-friendly people were put in charge, this steady erosion of the site could be reversed. For now however, only short-term thinkers are in charge who will squeeze all they can from the buyers and sellers until the business is defunct. Let's all hope that will change over time.",US

4013,www.ebay.com,2021-03-04T14:20:36.000Z,1,Quick review:,"Quick review: As a seller this site is absolutely abysmal. Extremely high fees considering how little support and help they give. Very poor seller resources when dealing with things like scammers. Ebay also tries to get around promotions that they offer by email.  More in-depth experiences: I've sold a handful of items on ebay. About 20 to 30 and I always found the cost to be insane. I calculated that for a $1300 USD sale I was out about 17% when the money finally arrived in my account. Ebay has also started screwing over sellers more by keeping your money / placing a hold on the money until the buyer receives the items.  As soon as you sell something ebay immediately starts harassing you to make payment for the fees owed. Meanwhile the two times ebay owed me money it took 6 months to get it the first time, and 2 years to get it the next time. Amazing right? Worse than the government. Recently I was targeted for a few frauds since I was selling items that had online codes included in the packaging. Frauders target these sales using stolen ebay accounts to scam you out of the code. ebay handled the situation extremely poorly and I can't imagine they actually cared. They gave the me different info from what they gave the person with the stolen account. They had no help pages on the topic. Their support was non-existent on the topic. Horrible experience considering I never get my money's worth on a sale in the first place. This just leads to more conflict between you and the person that had their account stolen because ebay expects you to deal with the situation to advise the ID frauded person on how to deal with the situation. The absolute depth of greed. Overall, Ebay is my last choice to sell anything. They've shown by far the highest level of greed of any corporation I've ever had to work with. Use Kijiji, reddit, or dedicated forums / markets for selling unless you're selling commercially and your margins include ebay fees.",CA

4021,www.ebay.com,2021-03-03T19:56:07.000Z,1,Ebay Targeting me and no Customer Support,"EDIT: I feel that Ebay is targeting me because of my complain. My account got banned for no reason. When I asked the reason why trough e-mail or Live Chat the agents or wouldn't answer me or would be rude. I can send all the screenshots. Got scammed by an EBay seller that has complains about being a scammer since last year and EBay didn`t do anything about it! An EBay seller called tomce12miners, scammed me to sent him Bitcoins to buy his machines. I first contacted him on January 30. 2021. I told him that I wanted to buy one Innosilicon A10 Miner, and he sent me the price in Bitcoins. I said no, that I would pay just with Paypal (as being a safe way), but he told me a story that his Paypal was blocked because of the amount of money coming to his account. So we agreed with the total price ( 0.105 BTC or $4000), and we agreed that I would pay half now and half after I had the machine in my hands. I believed he was an actual seller because he had more than 151 positive feedbacks, and no negative ones. Here is the first problem with EBay, many of those feedbacks were probably fake, and EBay let that happened. He even has a star from EBay for when you have many positive reviews.  So I was induced to believe he was an honest seller. After I sent 0.0525 Bitcoins or $2000 to tomce12miners account on February 2, he told me he was going to send me the track number, but then he stopped to answer me. I reported tomce12miners in many different social medias, and people that were scammed by him started messaging me telling the same story. I lost $2000, some people that messaged me lost more than $70,000. This is a millionaire scam, and probably one of the biggest ones from EBay. My problem with Ebay is first that they induced all of us victims to believe he was a trustful seller by showing us all of those positive reviews and even gave their star. My second problem with Ebay is that some of the people got scammed by this same guy on November of 2020. And they reported this scam to Ebay and they did NOTHING to stop that guy from scamming more people. If that wasn`t enough, a person posted on Ebay board about this scam and Ebay DELETED the post from the board. I just want my money back (0.0525 Bitcoins, or $2000) as all of the dozens other victims. One of the victims was even talking about how he attempted suicide twice after being scammed as he lost lots of money. I talked to Ebay using their customer service, and they only said that they would send this complain to their security team. That`s it, they didn`t give any other support, and I never heard back from them. This was all on the Ebay platform, so they have responsibility for it.",CA

I had to start the trace myself with USPS and spent over an hour on the phone to get it moving in the system. She wrote me an abusive insulting message on ebay and I turned it over to ebay. When the item did arrive it was not as described or pictured. I left a review and it stated that the seller was not helpful/response and the item was not as described. The seller had the review removed by ebay. Ebay could not explain why they removed the review despite the lack of help from the seller, her abusive messages and the item was not as described. I now realize that the reviews of the seller you read on ebay are not accurate and they are not to be trusted. Sellers lobby ebay to remove valid negative ratings. The item is being returned to the seller and I will be sure to videotape the packaging and sending of it back as I no longer trust ebay or the sellerrs on there.

I checked feedback policies to ensure I comply with eBay rules, and my feedback only said ""Unpleasant customer service experience"". Within 20 minutes, my feedback was erased by eBay and I got the short end of the stick from the whole transaction, and lost money. This is unacceptable, and unfortunately I keep seeing the same experiences by reviewers. Deleting honest feedback makes a potentially bad seller look perfect. As all customers, I rely on seller feedback when considering my purchases, and now it appears we cannot trust this anymore, as eBay appears to back sellers. This makes sense as keeping only positive feedback for sellers potentially increases their customer numbers and brings more revenue to the company, however at some other customers expense that may have had less than a positive transaction.

The seller provided tracking information that shows a replacement or exchanged item was successfully delivered to your address. After reviewing all the details of this case, we've determined that you won't receive a refund."" First of all, if your evidence is only based on one sided individual story and ignoring the other person such as me, you're very partial. Secondly, the seller was quick to open the case and quick to provide evidences but you didn't know what actually happened before then and because you have chosen to take the seller's side, evidence he had provided you then concluded to close the case as if he won the case already. If you were the judge, God forbid, I would have lost the case without taking my own turn.  Let me reply to your supposedly automated text. ""The seller provided tracking information that shows replacement or exchanged item was successfully delivered."" First of all, yes the seller Techmanic provided tracking information because that was the evidence he had to back up. The reason why he provided replacement it's because when I bought his refurbished  samsung s6 phone it was faulty within a week. The phone did not recognise the charger and therefore it stopped charging. I made a complaint attempting to give a bad review which was then to be approved and wasn't. Then, when I gmailed him that if he could replace with a better one he promised he would, there's evidence in the gmail texts. Then I was skeptic and doubting he would and he begged me for it. I gave him the trust and a heart to proceed the replacement with another phone. Unfortunately, when it arrived today the battery itself was faulty again. The battery percent went down faster without the use. So I wrote to him/her that the battery was indeed faulty and notified him in a week if the problem persists I would send the item back and get the refund this time. From there he immediately opened the case without my knowledge and I was shocked. I speculated much that he kinda used that cunning method to cheat me so that I wouldn't get the refund if I sent the item back. He kind of used the game on me and playing with my kindness. I wrote to him that I would reopen the case and tell my whole story and if further, report to the police for that. EBay has been very partial and it's not the first time it happens that I lose the case. Very shameful result of the case.",GB

Still, Ebay has chosen to ignore my original refund request date and has placed my request to them on hold until March 5th pending my receipt of whatever this scammer has shipped to me. Ebay has apparently not read my original request explaining this situation, nor have they reviewed this ""seller's (scammer's)"" reviews. Had they done ANY amount of research on this person, they would know this ""seller"" is a scammer and give the full refund their buyer protection is supposed to offer.  I have done a lot of purchasing through ebay over the years, but more recently they seem to have become a place where scammers have figured out a system that works, and ebay hasn't changed their policies to catch up. So saying, I am out as an ebay purchaser until ebay gets their act together.",US

Ebay further asserted there was nothing I could do through their system to get a refund of a product.  I returned the product unopened with a Fedex tracking # and withing the 30 days stated to be allowed for it.  The vendor stated the same policy meaning they wouldn't issue a refund if request for it didnt come through the Ebay system . I told EBay their system problem is not my problem. So I did in fact ""go outside"" as they suggested: ""go outside"". As I told them I would, I contacted my Bank's VISA dept and disputed the payment, I wrote Ebay's Executives and EBay's auditors and logged a formal compliant with the Feds (the consumer financial protection board). EBay will try to bluff you by acting like they are all powerful and can change the rules after your purchase. They also try to intimidate you or imply you are crazy by sending you a survey asking how was your contact with customer support shortly after customer support just stonewalled you by refusing to honor their terms.  Apparenetly that got them moving. In the end, the vendor did the refund and Ebay informed me and I confirmed my bank credit card account for a pending refund. In terms of supposed rules, you should further be aware I have seen that they do delete negative reviews which means the review #s they show for their vendors are false. I am cutting off my business as soon as my last order goes through and I straighten out any other problems from it and suggest you do the same.  Last - A PS: I caught a vendor stating a PC came with Windows 10 ""installed"" with Office but when directly asked he admitted the Windows 10  wasn't activated which meant you were not getting the license for it, just a trial version. So, watch out and make vendors answer your questions and dont buy if they dont answer. Better yet go elsewhere(Amazon, Walmart, Target). Ebay used to be good but in my experience have gone way downhill and become nasty. You're warned. In case you're suspicious I'm retired and have never had any connection whatsoever with any of these companies.",US

Good luck with that! The decision not to allow sellers to provide negative feedback also makes it impossible to have balanced feedback in the system. When sellers request to have negative(and inaccurate) feedback removed from their profiles, they decline to do anything. As such take all feedback ratings with a grain of salt. There are a ton of totally disreputable buyers and it's near impossible to notify membership about this. Additionally In Canada, it's no longer possible to even get hold of anyone on the phone.

It had only been 6 days and after 3 more days he escalated the case eBay decided in his favour within 10 minutes of the case being escalated. So after 9 days from the date of the order he received his money back. The item was delivered on the 14th day (2 weeks). We appealed asked eBay to reverse the buyer's payment, however, they did not. The buyer never responded to our messages, therefore, he had received his order for free thanks to eBay. The order was sent from UK to Azerbaijan in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, so 2 weeks is actually quite reasonable. I tried to explain to eBay but they couldn't care less. They'll happily play the covid card for themselves but they have zero compassion for small businesses. They are nothing more than crooks who exploit people like me.",GB

The concept of ebay is great, but get a problem and it soon becomes a nightmare. It's customer service is appalling. A tiny issue can escalate into account suspended due to the frustration of sending dozens and dozens and dozens of emails to people who at best can not speak or read English, to at worst being wound up to frothing, to entertain it's customer service staff.  I have never in all my life, seen a businesses customer service actively trying to bring its own company down, as i have with ebays customer service. They act like the police of a rouge state would, restricting, suspending and banning people for the most ridiculous things, yet the real crooks and swindlers go unpunished, while all the while Chinese sellers selling tat continue to sell....tat.  Ebay only survives because of it's sellers, no sellers, no buyers. They only survive for now because they have no real auction rival. As soon as one turns up, most of its sellers will jump ship, and ebay is finished or at best end up selling only Chinese tat. I do believe ebay are only 1/10th of the auction market possible, they have alienated the rest of it!!",GB

From summer 2020 our sale boosted to over 50k GBP per quarter and consistently on the rise for selling furniture goods.  Our company VAT registered and all legit, ebay started demanding one document after another and kept pestering over a second ebay account that we held. After submitting all documents, Ebay decided to block both of our accounts with the only explanation that we breached some ebay policies which they wouldn't disclose.  After several discussions with online chat ebay support with no availability of phone staff, ebay decided to permanently suspend our new ebay account without giving a reason and without offering any review for appeal.  One account permanent suspension was linked by ebay to our 15 year old 100% feedback account and they shut that as well leaving about 5 people jobless. As a young business thriving and rapidly growing, we had planned our stock and purchase accordingly; ebay's sudden, cruel and terrible dictatorial decision to suspend us permanently from selling has thrown us in deep trouble.  They've constantly turned a dead ear and blind eye to all the efforts I have made through ebay customer support. They'd simply not listen and wouldn't do anything whatsoever except reading the same script 'This decision is Final and we won't review it and you do not have right to appeal'.

Now in the past week I got a negative feedback on another item that I have 15 positive feedback on claiming that the item was not from the original manufacturer , same thing eBay would not remove it and the only way the buyer would revise it is with a full refund , of coarse he didn't say anything about returning the item and when I told him the item would have to be returned first and I would send him a shipping label he ignored me . After checking  the feedback that he has left for other sellers it seems this is what he does , they were all negative . Notified eBay about this and said to notify the buyer to have it removed , what kind of seller protection is that ? Now they want to have control over your money and say I must sign up by the end of February , bull there is no way I will give them my bank account information .

This time it was selling off 40 of my personal collection watches, a high percentage of which had been purchased via ebay.  Sales closed on a Thursday, a couple on Friday and several more (approx 20 all together) Saturday. Before Sundays items could close, ebay, without warning, removed my still up for bid items and restricted my account, forbidding me from listing and/or selling until I jumped through their gestapo like hoops. They , at least it seemed to me, wanted to see sold items delivered and feedback left, thus verifying I was actually selling and delivering things and not just taking payments. I didn't like this treatment but had no alternative, they will not talk to you, just try to find a phone number, and they won't really tell you what the concern is, as they worry about covering their butt legally, I assume.  So I sent all the tracking info, showing packages were posted within 24 hours, and then feedback responses from completely happy buyers. After sending this info on about half of the original purchases, to date, only 4 business days later, they decided to ask for more documentation.......such as documentation that shows I purchased the goods sold (prove I didn't steal them), documentation that shows my supplier (ebay sellers) information,  quantity purchased, price per unit and payment information.  I don't REALLY know what the issue is, what they are REALLY nervous about, but most of what they want is in thier own records and available to them with a couple clicks of the mouse, me, I've had enough of ebay, besides what have become oppressive fees, they now are basically accusing me of fraud or being a thief. They forget they are a fancy garage sale and not the only game in town, once they are no longer convenient, they are no longer an option. Ebay, you suck.",US

There are no safeties in place, they will tell you that there are, that's a lie. They have full access to take money and put money in your account as you do.

So, it makes me wonder, who thought up this bright idea? That's a joke! I also run a business, I have received money from all different kinds of payment, PayPal, Square, and there are so many more.

I contacted Royal Mail for them to advise the courier hit 'delivered' before it was handed over, the parcel was then refused at the door as I clearly didn't live where they attempted delivery. The status of the tracking then advised 'recipient gone away, to be returned to sender'. On 04/02/2021 the item was delivered back to the seller in Coventry and the tracking states this. I then made a complaint with royal mail about the issue.  I have contacted the seller multiple times with no response on any occasion. I then opened a case under the resolution centre, ebay advised to wait for a response from the seller about my issues. Again no response from the seller.  I continued to go through Ebay providing them with all the evidence, eBay then closed the claim based on an 'attempt' at delivery on the 29th January. Despite clear evidence from the tracking and Royal mail confirming of there error they still refused a refund and continued to say contact the seller.  Not only that, but the communication has been shocking.  Given all the evidence you have here are some of your responses  1, It's good to know that you are now in contact with YODEL about the issue with the delivery for the Multifunctional Dining Table 5 Tier Bookcase Bookshelf With Metal Frame (223920465724).

After completion of the waiting period, the item is now in process to be shipped back to the seller. We will not be able to initiate refund for this transaction because the seller completed their part of transaction by ensuring that the item is delivered to their nearest delivery office. Since delivery of the item cannot be checked physically by eBay; thus, any attempted delivery is considered as a ""successful delivery"".

Furthermore, contacting them was so bizarre and painstaking because you can't find their email address unless you manually search for it and if you call them then it just directs you to the website which is just useless. It's like finding a needle in a haystack. Also, the chat feature was and still is ridiculous every time I wanted to contact an eBay representative it kept saying there was an error and that I should try next time. Anyways, when I eventually found the email address and asked them why they put a restriction on my account they said that they noticed some ""serious activity"" that was a concern to their community. Then I had to answer 6 questions about what type of products I was selling, what was the average price of my products, names of suppliers and distributors, PayPal address and where I got my products from. After I answered those questions I received another email saying that my account had been reinstated and everything had been restored and they said I could relist my items again and that they have verified the information and now it's on my file. They even apologised for the inconvenience caused. I was so glad that the problem was resolved and any misconceptions were now cleared. So as any normal person I decided to relist my products reviewing it again to make sure that it followed the eBay guidelines and policies, however, I received another email two days after saying that my account was suspended and then another email saying that it was permanently suspended and I couldn't sell or purchase any products. I was furious, shocked and discombobulated, I genuinely thought that everything had been cleared up and that I would be able to sell again but apparently, that was not the situation. What was the reason they decided to permanently suspend my account? Because they ""noticed activity that they believed to be a serious risk to their community"" So I had emailed them again and when I asked them what was so serious that was a risk, they couldn't find an answer so they kept repeating the same message that my account was permanently suspended and that I can't appeal for it at all and if anyone tries to register from another device it will restrict that account as well. Just to be clear to those of you who are wondering what I was trying selling it was just Branded Brand New Shaving Cans. That's it! I even had 100% feedback rating.

I recently sold a DVD box set to somebody in Florida. Tracking showed the item as delivered and the next thing I know eBay is holding funds because they claim the buyer initiated a chargeback with his bank—he didn’t recognize the transaction. I contacted the buyer a few times but he ignored each message. He did, however, leave a neutral  feedback saying he has no issue with item, he did not complain & it’s eBay’s fault. I called eBay and pointed out his neutral feedback and the fact that he was happy with his item and asked why I’m not getting paid. They told me it was up to the bank and that they have 90 days to make a decision. They also said if the bank decides in favor of the buyer I have to reimburse him $29 and I have to pay a $20 fee to eBay. They told me that after seeing that the buyer is happy with his item. That is how eBay treats their top sellers—the people who make their CEOs rich. This all happened because of managed payments. Twice in the past buyers have tried to initiate chargebacks and both times, because of PayPal’s seller protection, I was covered. Those days are over. And so are my days of trading on eBay.",US

They changed their system so they no longer are using paypal for payouts to people. They would not pay me unless I provided my social security number.  I told them they could send me a check, deposit it into my PayPal account, or put it on my charge card-all of which they have access to because I provided all that information in my personal eBay account.  But they insist on my SS number.  I was already hacked and I am a victim of identity theft.  My attorney warned me never to put my SS# out on the internet, so I have to listen to him.

My husband and I had $600 in ebay gift cards that were given to us as a gift in the summer of 2020.  While purchasing a beach house I decided last week to use those cards to purchase household items.  While checking out I entered all three of my card numbers, it showed $600 once I went to submit it showed 0 dollars.  I immediately called ebay to discover that they froze my funds, I ask why?  The representative said they have cards stolen all the time and they need to verify they weren't stolen.  Are you freaking kidding me??  I was then put through a process of taking pictures of the back of each card, writing my name,  email address on a piece of paper then sending this to ebay for possible approval of giving me my money back.   I received an email three days later saying sorry until you provide proof of purchase we can't refund you.   Now I'm really pissed!  I responded to the email that they are thieves they stole my money.   I will tell everyone I know and I hope you share this review to never deal with these unethical thieves.

Then they take another 2 days to process the payment to your bank. There's almost a week, where it took literally 100th of a second with PayPal. They sold these changes as being helpful and beneficial to the seller. It's been over a month and I'm still untangling things from the policy switch. There are not enough words in the English language to say how deeply I detest this company.",US

4265,www.ebay.com,2021-02-01T20:02:56.000Z,1,I wish I can give 0 or -5 but 1 is the…,"I wish I can give 0 or -5 but 1 is the lowest. Where do I start, likewise some other resent reviews I think eBay needs to be stopped from opperating for so many reasons. First - the 30 day guarantee its the biggest wipe hands tool ever, it's actually one of the worst thing a customer can have and let me explain. The 30 day guarantee kicks in from the date of the purchase not the day you got the item or staring using it. Now due to Covid, Brexit and other restrictions items not coming as soon as did befor and item can take even 2 weeks, so you are left with 2 weeks to report a problem, now imagine this is a consumable a water filter or toothbrushe head like in my case, I still had life on my old brush and I started using the new ones in few weeks and the 30 day guarantee has passed, this item normally last 3 months but now after just a a week and a half the head of the brush became wobly, very uncomfortable and about to fell which is hazardous too you can choke on it. So what I am supposed to do with a faulty item, eBay said get in touch with customer I did but he never came back and this way you lose few precious days, I asked eBay to help but needed to wait 3 new days after you file a complaint for eBay to assist, they never did by they way neither eBay or customer. After another week I got in touch with them and do you know what they said: First get in touch with PayPal, what if didn't used PayPal. Second get on touch with OralB because the item is faulty. Third I am sorry the item is faulty but there is nothing we can do. So to summarize guys, eBay don't take any responsibility what so ever for the items sellers are offering, they don't care if the items are faulty or not, they don't care if you lost your money or not but they conveniently wipe their hands with the 30 day guarantee which is almost useless and not competitive service this days. In other words they told me to fu... off and deal with alone and they will not do absolutely nothing about it. When I asked them do you realize i am stuck with a faulty items, they said I am sorry and that's it. Please avoid eBay use Amazon never had issues and when I did they been helpful and very reasonable.",GB

On Jan 19, 2021 I sold a Epson Artisan 1430 Inkjet Printer Brand New but AS IS because it wasn't turning on ebay for $194.67. The original price was $649. But It wasn't turning on so I thought to sell it AS IS broken, for PARTS only. No returns, no refunds and no exchanges.    Jan. 22 :The buyer requested a return Going back and forth with the buyer I  offer him a partial refund. HE DECLINED.  Then I told him to ship it back, but he needs to pay for shipping. HE DECLINED. Then the Buyer made up some **bleep** false claims and escalated the claim with ebay.  EBAY favored the buyer and I am forced to take it back including paid shipping.    Yesterday it got delivered back to me.  I open the back and I was so shocked.    When I received the printer back it was missing lots of parts. All the accessories are missing I send was missing! He kept all the accessories. Also the original receipt that I have included in the sale was missing. Aside from that, the printer head is also missing and worst of all the sticker where the serial number was is also missing! The buyer has scratched off the serial number sticker!!!  Oh did I mention that the BUYER SELL PRINTERS?  Once he made the return request I saw his shop he sold printers. A day later all his listing were gone!  What a co-incident!    Here are the items that are missing.   All manuals Power cables CDs and DVD drives DVD print tray printer head printer cover of the ink box Original receipt Serial number sticker Paper feeders   The printer came back in a very terrible shape and had physical damage. I have pictures for proof. Buyer not only made false claims but has also misused and abused ebays return policy. He knew exactly that he could get away with it.  The printer was missing items and it was damaged beyond repair. Oh and immedialty upon delivery like basically 30 mins later after I open the package the buyer proof tracking number to EBAY and Ebay has refunded him in full and favor the buyer!  Ebay had the last word and they didn't want to know my side of the story nor hear the seller's input.   Oh and Ebay took money (that I didn't have) out of my Paypal.  Now I have a negative paypal  Paypal tried to get money out of my bank account.  But luckily I put a STOP PAYMENT ORDER ON PAYPAL with my bank.  Paypal and ebay are getting NOTHING from me.  They have favored the buyer! THey should get the money back from the buyer!!!!    On Jan 30 I sent an appeal to ebay. Ebay: We weren't able to give you a refund   EBAY SEND ME THIS MESSAGE AND CLOSE THE CASE Hi Christine, After reviewing this case, we decided to keep the original outcome. We understand that you received your item in a different condition from when you shipped it. Unfortunately, we weren't able to grant your appeal because we couldn't determine that this was caused by the buyer, or that this was something in the buyer's control.   You won't receive a refund for this case.   EBAY is as worst as the buyer themselves! They favored the buyer and they refunded him and they close the case in his favor. Leaving the seller in a loss with a broken and damaged item.   I have been with eBay for a while now. This buyer was a liar and a thief. A cheater. A horrible buyer in every way. This buyer says something is wrong with the item (whether there is or not) eBay favors them and I am forced to refund his money back and in return get my broken item back with the missing serial number and parts. THIS IS NOT RIGHT! The bottom line is that ebay takes the buyers word for it and never the sellers. Leaving sellers unsafe and screwed! Ebay should be ashamed of themselves. I will stop selling on ebay. They just lost another seller. The buyer knew exactly how to play ebay and ebay got fooled by a cheater. They lost a good and honest seller. The buyer is theft and cheated misusing ebays buyer garantie. All I can now say is I HATE EBAY and I HATE PAYPAL! I will now start selling on Facebook marketplace. Offerup and Nextdoor app. Ebay has horrible greedy business practices.   I have filed a complaint with BBB.  And I will let my story be heard all over social media!

Then when you finally get your item set and visible for purchase/bidding, you are uncertain if it will show worldwide, or only in certain countries...

It's also clear they don't read messages sent their way as part of the process, or that AI is doing a pretty lousy job for them. They then force sellers to contact buyers for a refund. Good luck with that! The decision not to allow sellers to provide negative feedback also makes it impossible to have balanced feedback in the system. When sellers request to have negative(and inaccurate) feedback removed from their profiles, they decline to do anything. As such take all feedback ratings with a grain of salt. There are a ton of totally disreputable buyers and it's near impossible to notify membership about this. Additionally In Canada, it's no longer possible to even get hold of anyone on the phone. When dialing the # found online someone answered 'Hello Kijiji'. She then apologized and gave me a different number that is now out service. Sadly, Ebay has become a joke.

The 100% positive feedback’s means nothing at all. I cannot believe that Ebay would allow this to happen but it appears they do.

I negotiated the repair of the tool and replacement of parts. The seller never reimbursed me for the repairs and Ebay had to step in and refund me the cost of repairs. I left a negative feedback for the lying seller and it has been removed even though Ebay found the complaint to be in my favor. randc_inc. is a seller to watch out for his track record is not accurate. Another seller with a false feedback record is Prostartools this seller sold me a new riveting tool for 865.00 I told him that if he could not get the tool to me by the upcoming Friday please cancel the item. He said it was to late and that it had already shipped. He did manage to get the brand new riveting tool to me by Friday, however upon getting ready to use the tool I found it to be missing vital parts making it useless. I contacted the seller and told him that the parts were missing I gave the seller a chance to make it right. He sent the part as slow as possible knowing I had a pending use for the tool. The tool made it to me in four days. The parts were well over a week. I made arrangements to return the tool and against Ebay policy I was forced to return the tool at my own expense. I refused the part when it finally showed up. Ebay found the case in my favor I received a full refund less the cost to ship the item back to the seller.

4351,www.ebay.com,2021-01-22T01:02:36.000Z,1,I Didn't Realize That Ebay Was in the BRIBERY BUSINESS,"I recently purchased an item on ebay last month (December 2020). The seller was listed as CMFarmingLLC located in Miami, FL. The item was supposedly available and there were more than one of them. I purchased ONE. The product details stated that the item could arrive anywhere from December 28 - January 6. I made my purchase on December 20, a shipping label was created on December 21. I did receive a confirmation email stating the order was accepted. When I got the tracking #, it did not look like any tracking # that I had ever seen before. I found the USPS tracking # inside the unusually long tracking # that was provided. And then I waited........and waited. Finally on January 1, 2021 I contacted the seller to see when my package would actually ship. 2 days later a reply came and the only thing said was that they would ""check on it"". Nothing more. No further communication. Then on January 5th I sent another message to the seller. This time a reply came back the next day and the litany of excuses that the seller listed was incredible. The heat, the cold, the virus, the holidays, blah, blah, blah. Then at the end of the message, ""will check on it"". No further communication. December 28th came and went, January 6th came and went. Then on January 8th the item arrived at the shipping partner site in Los Angeles, CA. Nowhere near Miami, FL. LA sends the package info to El Paso, TX, then the package departs LA on January 10th, it leaves LA and goes to Grapevine, TX. (near Dallas). It takes 4 days to get from LA to Grapevine. Then on the 15th it makes it to USPS in El Paso and delivers on January 16, 2021. Guess where the return address is from? Jamaica, NY!  The return address was: LEE 147-03 182 st Jamaica, NY 11413 When I did a Google search of this address, I found it. It's a warehouse and it had all kinds of trucks backed up to the bays, but the street address was there on the wall. As I mentioned earlier the seller's name on ebay is CMFARMINGLLC. I looked that up as well. There is a ""company"" listed under this name with the sole agent as being CARLOS MARIN and in Miami, FL. That's the company listing, that's not where the item is coming from. My experience in buying on places like ebay over the years has taught me that when it takes 3 weeks or more for an item to SHIP you can pretty well bet that the seller DOES NOT HAVE PHYSICAL POSSESSION of the item. In this case it was most likely coming from CHINA. And coming into LOS ANGELES would make sense. The shipping partner ended up being PITNEY BOWES. That explained the unusually long tracking number involved. I had never had dealings with them before and didn't realize it was them until the LA info appeared. Then the tracking # worked and I was able to track it SORT OF. Now, if the item came into LA and shipped from LA, why is there a Jamica, NY as a return address on the envelope? So, we have Miami, FL/Los Angeles, CA/ Jamaica, NY AND most likely CHINA. The seller isn't going to answer questions, that wouldn't be beneficial to them. This buying experience was nothing short of a NIGHTMARE. What added to the issue is that ebay has gone so far downhill that there is no way to contact them to discuss this problem. You can't call customer service, you can't chat, you can't call tech support, you can't even call corporate. NO WAY TO MAKE CONTACT. Except through places such as this. On the date of delivery I went in and left feedback. 85 characters makes one very creative in shorthand. But, the issue was addressed. Later that same day I received an email from the seller offering to give me a full refund if I would only give POSITIVE FEEDBACK. Where I come from that's called bribery. The seller is using bribery to get positive feedback. Then on the 19th of January I receive an email from ebay asking that I modify my feedback because the seller resolved the issue. NO THEY DIDN'T. There is no way for the seller to resolve anything, the shipping issue is over and done with. The part that I had ordered was what I wanted, it worked and I answered the feedback questions honestly. I described my experience honestly. It was never about getting the money back. I got what I paid for, but it was the lack of communication, lack of honesty on the seller's part and the inordinate length of time in shipping. How dare ebay endorse BRIBERY! I realize the company is sinking into the gutter, but that was very audacious of them to do that. Will I retract my feedback - HELL NO! It stands because that is what happened. If ebay or the seller doesn't like it - so! I had to wait almost one month to get a part that the seller supposedly had in their possession. What's up with that? You can't resolve that. It's already done! Has anyone else experienced this type of behavior from sellers? Or ebay for that matter? Keep up the fine upstanding work ebay, you're going downhill fast.",US

Ebay has always been the most frustrating to use. Recently, I noticed that the fees the company took and that they advertised weren't matching up with what I was being charged. After spending too much time trying to figure it out I contacted their help line. I was told that for this particular item I was referencing that I was being charged an extra currency conversion fee due to the buyer being out of the country, even though the product was being shipped to California address. I was little dumbfounded that I was being charged that fee and not the buyer. Nor did I have any way of knowing that the buyer was out of the country.  Two days later after complaining about this, I get an email saying my account had been deleted due to ""unsafe activity"". Email didn't go into details and said the decision was final and could not be reviewed. I couldn't access my account which was very frustrating as I had just ordered something and had a couple orders in the process of shipping. Now, I've sold hundreds of items on ebay. I had an above average seller rating. No complaints. No issues. I was completely in shock on how this could have happened. Once again, I reached out to try to find some answers. When asked if they could give me the details of the ""unsafe activity"" on my account their customer service agent responded ""As much as we want to provide more details of the suspension, those information remains protected by eBay because if we told members how we suspend accounts, it would provide them with a way to circumvent our policy and process in the future."" Basically, ebay punishes you for something you did wrong but won't tell you what you did wrong! I don't know what policy I could have broken for them to take drastic action. Therefore I can only infer that if you complain about their business actions they retaliate against you. And why be so secretive other than to screw their customers?  Today, there are so many other online/app companies to compete with ebay. Why not stand out with openness, transparency and great customer service?  I could sign back up and start selling again. But with so many other companies out there that offer so much more (even if some of them have slightly higher selling fees) there is really no reason to go back to selling or buying on ebay.",US

After I mailed it back, the seller tried to dispute their own credit for the return shipping. I am trying to post feedback on this seller, but am finding that ebay protects rogue sellers at all costs. The ebay customer communications pathways are hermetically sealed. They all lead back to the same cheerful ebay representative who informs the caller that their lines are no longer in operation and that means to contact ebay are posted in the Resolution Center and at their Help page. They aren't. All those pathways double back on themselves to the same pages that sidetrack away from any possible help. As others have posted, if you are lucky enough to find the chat link (be prepared to spend an inordinate amount of time), the chat representative will deliberately misrepresent what you are asking about in their replies, persistently ""misunderstand"", violate ebay policies, and do their uttermost to avoid dealing with any issue. The same goes for their email ""customer service representatives"". They are all there to frustrate you, get rid of you, and avoid any real issue. The upshot is that this seller, who boasted to me of their ""perfect"" review record will go on deceiving and defrauding buyers because ebay is blocking me from any link to do so simple a thing as leave seller feedback. So as I cancel my membership and go out the door, all I can tell you is that you use this site at your own great risk.

Want to know how to borrow a seller's items (especially electronics) for a few weeks, even if the seller doesn't allow returns? Under Ebay's Money Back Guarantee Policy, you can keep the item for up to 30 days and then falsely claim an item wasn't as described and a seller has to refund you or make you return the item and you'll still get a refund! Regardless of whether a seller files a report to the Trust and Safety Department against the buyer, they still have to be refunded. The worst punishment a buyer can get is just not being covered for claims anymore. Spoke with customer support and they admitted they were aware of the problem. I would recommend staying away from this company if you're a Seller. And if you're a buyer- why buy off Ebay? Cheaper sites to buy off like Aliexpress (they tend to carry the same stuff), and Walmart & Target probably have what you're looking for. Also, mobile marketplace apps like Mercari/Depop have nice modern interfaces, people selling things for cheaper.",US

It was a great way to get rid of unneeded stuff around the house.  But not only did it get more complex - and correspondingly harder to use - over time, it also just plain doesn't work as well.  I use Mozilla Firefox, and I dare anyone to print an eBay return label from it - if you succeed, you're more technically savvy that I am, and I'm an engineer.  I finally gave up and printed it from Chrome.  It's not like there are dozens of browsers out there; asking eBay to support Firefox is hardly unreasonable. [2021 Update] My review from a couple of years ago seems quaint! Since then, I have figured out just how high their fees are: I sold a video card for $250. My buyer in Georgia paid $268 due to sales tax. I netted $217. My buyer paid 23% more than I got! Secondly: When you can't sell ""And To Think That I Saw It On Mulberry Street"" by Dr. Seuss on eBay (I personally tried it) because it's too offensive, it's time to find a new place to sell.",US

I requested a refund, the seller declined so I posted feedback on the transaction.  Ebay hid my feedback. They never sent me a notice they did, I had to log on and see the seller had their ""perfect"" rating so I had to spend 45 minutes finding out why my review was not posted.  Ebay said it was not in line with their community standards and then said I was fortunate not to have been placed on a probation or something for the review.  The review simply said I paid over retail price for used boots that were a different size than seller represented and I was scammed.  I asked to have the opportunity to re-post my review, nothing.  It appears to be a racket where Ebay protects their sellers, which is fine but not at the expense of the buyers.  I used to believe the seller ratings were legit, but they appear to be fraudulent.  If you cant trust the seller ratings, its too risky to buy there, especially when Ebay is helping cover up the bad ratings.  If you get scammed, you are up against the seller and Ebay.

I got the run around for 2 months, I had paid more in shipping to and return than what the item went for in auction and was given no option to wait or contest it. I didn't have the money but Ebay said they'd take it anyway if I didn't refund the buyer. My account went into the negative because of it and after months of back and forth then finally someone tells me some other company is the ones that insure the item not them because the Post office for some reason didn't insure it when I clicked insurance at shipping. Then I wait another month and get approved for my insurance claim. I received $30 out of the almost $300 that everything cost me!

I recently made a purchase on the app, and the seller placed an auto-memo saying they're away till a later date.  Only the desktop version displayed this message - not the app. This resulted in me dealing with disputes and ebay customer service various times, with multiple failed pushback attempts from eb.  The solution to this problem was to basically deal with the seller myself and contact eb again for further issues.  Doing this would result in me saying the same story again and again to new reps, and getting new pushback along the way. Things don't seem to have changed much since years ago, when I sold a pair of 3d shutter glasses for several hundreds of dollars.  To my own mistake I shipped them without tracking.  The buyer (who I strongly believe was a scammer) waited a couple days and asked where they were.  I politely told him they just shipped 2 days ago and (as per ad) will be there in a few days, no tracking.  The buyer left negative feedback on my account, claiming I am a scammer and they had been waiting weeks for the item (actually 2 days).  They opened an undelivered item claim against me, and ebay asked for tracking.  I could not as it was not included.  Ebay ruled in favor of the buyer and refunded the money, as I couldn't prove I shipped it unless tracking was provided.  I understood the situation, took the hard lesson, and accepted the loss - however I asked that the negative feedback be removed as it affects future sales by ruining my 100% positive score.  They refused to remove it as it is a member-to-member feedback.  I proved that they were leaving false claims as eb could see it was purchased 2 days ago, and the buyer was claiming they were waiting weeks. Eb still did nothing.  I tried to politely plead with the buyer, offering generous discount for the ""inconvenience"", and they just abruptly/rudely turned me away.  Lesson learned, ill never ship without tracking again, and eb customer service (to me) is very unaccountable and has been for years.

Tracking system has no indication of anything more than a 'label' being generated.  Ebay is saying this is sufficient evidence to put my refund request for over $900 (!) on hold to give the package time to arrive.  Ordered on Dec 9!  My son will not have a present under the xmas tree if we don't lay out another $$$.  AND top it off, this was a seller who was able to snag a hot gaming system and selling it for double the price it cost him.

Another 2 weeks later I had not received it and opened a case. Cases are automated. The seller gave an excuse that shippers are having difficulties. A human would have seen that the shipping label was created 2 weeks after purchase and the delay was the seller. While it saves the eBay money, it frustrates their customers.

Imagine you sold that item and you paid minimum postage 68p then you have to pay final value fee 20p. 3. Remember you will need a PayPal account for your transaction with eBay and they have their own fees which is 3.4%+30p (30p is fixed fee) which means you have PayPal fee for 37p. 4.

So let add all and find out our profit/loss for working with eBay. £2 your item 57p eBay fee 68p postage 10p minimum cost of your envelope 37p Paypal fee And you put your time for it (you worked) You will have (2)-(0.57)-(0.68)-(0.10)-(0.37)= £0.28 profit! eBay earned 57p Post Office earned 68p PayPal earned 37p You earned 28p and all IF your initial cost of your item be £0.00 Suppose you bought your item for 50p to sell £2 then you will loss 22p. I don't know how people sell their items for 99p on eBay. With all calculation for selling items for 99p they loss 58p even if your initial cost of their item be £0.00 So why eBay doesn't close 99p selling option like Amazon?

THE NEXT DAY the buyer files a claim with eBay that he never received an item and eBay closed the claim THE SAME DAY ruling in buyers favor and deducted the money from me to refund the buyer. I appealed the case showing them proof that the package is still in transit, and that it is not lost, and that I would refund the money IF the package was deemed lost or arrived damaged. eBay CLOSED my appeal the SAME DAY citing that they have reviewed my appeal and will not reverse their decision....So now not only did the buyer get his money back, but he gets to keep the items for free when they arrive. I have initiated a package reroute through USPS to try to recover my items, but as far as I can tell, I may not get them back.

There is no reason why their system doesn't retain seller transaction records for more than 90 days. Or, just because I don't sell items on a monthly basis.

After 10 years of eBay bliss I ran into a brick wall and a very unfair decision. I deleted my account.   A year later, I thought I’d give it another try.  I was satisfied until this month.  I made an electronic purchase of an item I have had a few times before. I am legally blind and a Senior living off Social Security. Every penny is precious.  I noticed a problem with the fit of the item and contacted the seller.  We have gone back and forth a few times in the last month and I even sent photos.

The 4th time I contact the seller...they left me a short cryptic note about how the ‘window for returning’ has now closed. !!!!!!!!????????????? Iti was only a 30 day warranty and they wasted time in the back and forth.  So I tried to file for an A-Z guarantee.  I found out you can only do that during the warranty.  I went to file negative feedback and now, the rules have changed. If they warranty is expired (30 days for electronics!) then you can’t even leave feedback.  I used to be able to call them...now their “Contact us” leads you around and around in a circle and never to any page that accomplishes a thing and never to a human being...just a robot chat.

FedEx could offer no insight, other than to advise it was up to the shipper to file a claim for non-receipt. I began an Ebay investigation Dec 1st and on Dec 5th, asked Ebay to step in'. Ebay claimed that based on the tracking info showing the package delivered, they closed the case without issuing a refund ($49.99). I was unsuccessful in attempts to reach Ebay by phone. The Seller had (1) Negative feedback at the time I made my purchase (Buy It Now). Out of ~9 total Feedbacks, the Seller had, by Nov 30th, received (including my disappeared Negative) 3 total Negative feedbacks for the same issue, missing items, with one other buyer who suffered the exact experience as me, a seemingly valid tracking number, but no item received after the shipper showed their item delivered. Based on the facts, Ebay was manifestly unfair in dismissing my valid claim and forcing me to file through Paypal and/or my bank for non-receipt. Beginning in the late 1990's, I used Ebay regularly and currently have a 100% feedback rating of 469. I will likely use Ebay  less, if at all, in the future, since this experience has shown me they don't stand behind their money back guarantee.  The Seller has sent no responses to my messages asking for help locating the missing package or, in the alternative, issuing a refund. Ebay unfairly deprived others of reading the Negative feedback I posted of this transaction, by making the feedback invisible or otherwise caused it to disappear.

He said no piece was in the box. I have pictures the bowls were perfect right before mailing.

Now EBay is charging me 36.00 in selling fees because they “found in favor of the buyer”! I have no bowls, no money, and can’t close my EBay account for 30 days because they took the 36.00 in selling fees off my Paypal account and they won’t have the money for 30 days.

I immediately informed them, and eBay said, we don't care, tell the seller.  Their contact info for the seller was inaccurate, so I had to hunt them down. I found the seller and contacted them, and they said we don't care, we're going to mail it to this old address eBay supplied. I contacted the post office, but they said the shipper had not made available any means to intercept or redirect the package, even if I paid extra. The item was lost forever. eBay said the seller probably didn't see my message until after it was sent - but the seller replied to my message, which was sent within at most 20 minutes of seeing that eBay intended to ship my package to a wrong address rather than the one I had given them. The seller (""my-best-source"") literally told me they were going to send it to the wrong address. It wasn't shipped until the following day. They stole $70+ from me, and gave me nothing in return. Please never, ever try to buy anything from eBay, and certainly not from ""my-best-source."" You will regret it. They automatically generate fake 5-star reviews when you place an order! My experience - the most awful customer service experience I've ever had - generated fake 5-star reviews.

Do not ever start that process of a return unless you truly need to return the item. They will refuse to override it yet will calm and comfort the buyer like a baby. Absolutely revolting and they will force a label and charge you. You as a seller get left in the dust. I hope this company goes down in flames.

Then I received an email from Mary at eBay Customer Support team asking if I have received a return from the buyer. I duly replied to it stating I have not had any communication, nor a return from the buyer. I wasn’t even aware of any issues with the sale. The incompetence starts A few minutes passed since firing the reply, still no response from Mary or any members of CS. Then I received an email saying the case was decided in buyer’s favour and the money was debited from my account.  Going through the motion So now since no response was given to my email, and the case doesn’t have information about why the buyer wishes to return it or any tracking details showing for that matter, the onus is on me now to call them and sort out their debacle, right!!  Farce begins  1.	So I called, I spoke to a gentleman and I explained the whole “saga” who didn’t have any idea what was going on! But promised to pass on the details to the “Appeal team”. A few minutes later I was passed on to Moreen at the appeal team, who didn’t have any idea why I was passed on to her! Such a professional phone handling skills. So now I had to spend another 15mins explaining the case all over. 2.	After about 20mins, she said she can see the tracking shows the buyer sent it back to me on 29th Oct. So I asked a.	when was it delivered? She said on 29th Oct b.	Was it signed for? She said yes c.	How could the buyer send a return a MONTH BEFORE I even dispatch it?! It didn’t click to her. So I had to repeat the question 3 times before she got it 3.	I couldn’t deal with the monotonous and robotics tone anymore and I asked to be transferred to a manager, hopefully with some common sense. But she promised to deal with it and reverse the outcome quickly, so I spent another 15mins in the freezing cold waiting for her to open her eyes to the undeniable truth: We are all being conned here by the buyer who is evidently enabled to abuse eBay protection programme by ridiculous button pushers who aren’t prepared to look at facts before deciding a case.  4.	Still it’s about end of play today and no refund or email to confirm what has been decided sent yet, and it seems I’d again have to call them and explain things over to another member. It’s beyond me …. The “Sellers are crooks” mantra The fact that eBay decided the case in buyer’s favour in such a quick manner and without even replying to the seller with tracking gives me the impression that we (sellers) are being taken for a ride here by eBay. We are simply the black sheep in this equation.  eBay is more than happy to take their fees for the sale, NOT refund the fees for a return. Yet when a buyer raises a “fraudulent claim”  like the one I have had their CS team doesn’t seem motivated  to assist at all. And it’s upon on the seller to call, explain the outrageously glaring mistakes and breach of trust and business terms their team has done, chase and chase for the refund, YET better we are not even allowed to leave feedback for the people who actually have done the mistake  and set us unnecessarily on the goose chase! eBay is not for professional sellers It is clear as day light now; eBay is simply more geared up towards selling used product occasionally.

4748,www.ebay.com,2020-11-24T19:41:59.000Z,2,Ebay Unorganized.,"Ok! Before I start my review the only reason why I gave Ebay 2 stars instead of 1 is because they at least respond and at least got in contact with me about my situation. Ebay needs to really work on upgrading their TOS and Policy I say that because their policy isn't quite organized and fair and kind of unprofessional to me in my opinion. For example, there's a rule that states sellers are not require to respond to messages or cancel request. I mean ok that is your rule but many sellers barely provide information about their listings other than the product name, and to be honest If you are going to be selling things on Ebay at least don't be ignorant to ignore that person message that is just curious about the item, when all you got to do is simply respond to their message how hard is it? My situation I don't know if the person was ignoring my message or not so this message is directly for the sellers that purposely ignore messages.  Another thing I believe should be added is that when a buyer wants to cancel their transaction or order that is not a bid they should and there should be an automatic system that allows you to automatically cancel your order if the order has not been shipped. Otherwise, I believe if the item is either shipped the seller should have the decision to cancel the order or not. Amazon has that option, which I will be probably using Amazon for now on. Lastly, Ebay get it together before you end up loosing a lot of customer from the sellers scamming and being greedy. Not all sellers on Ebay is like this but many of them are ignorant piece of sh** that turns a problem that can easily be fixed difficult. Ebay same goes for you find a way to make a system that can basically prevent many problems; I even helped give ideas.",US

Purchased a $5,000 item and needed important information about the software required to operate the product (that can't be operated WITHOUT the software) as well as shipping information but couldn't get any responses from the seller.  So I contacted ebay support first trying via phone but apparently that's no longer an option. No more phone customer support. So I tried going through their website... literally 45 minutes later when I had clicked through what seemed like 50 different options to try to get to an actual human, I FINALLY get to a human on chat. The person could barely speak English and no matter what I said, it's like they were just ignoring my questions and reading off a template and not answering my questions AT ALL. So I ended that chat, go through everything again to get in touch with another agent: same exact thing - they're just reading off a template and won't actually help you with what you need unless it's part of their script or something. And apparently they have NO way of contacting a seller on their site. Dozens of messages I've sent this seller and not a single response from them and ebay can do absolutely nothing about it except for open a case but ONLY if the item was not delivered. But it was delivered he just didn't include the software information as promised by the item discription - making the device absolutely useless. And in this case, no: you cannot get the software elsewhere. It's a specific software with a specific code for this specific device. Ebay's response: Oh well, nothing we can do about it.  I used to swear by ebay and recommend it to all of my friends because I knew the customer service was great but now... I mean just... wow... what happened, Ebay? You're doing well this year in terms of net growth so what's going on with your customer service???  Anyway I'd definitely avoid using ebay now. Certainly the last time I'll be using it. What a shame. Used to be so great. It's all I ever used to use.",US

Hopefully, this will give an idea to other sellers of what could happen. As one of the greatest platforms for buy and sell I decided for eBay as my best shot to sell my item. So I good faith I listed it in and waited, it can happen that listing won't update immediately. After 48 hours I started to be nervous, after one week I started to be suspicious,  so I contacted the help center. That day we exchanged 9 emails, well illustrated, very tiresome. My item was not listed and simply invisible to anybody apart people with direct link of upload (naturally only I had it). Since the ""listing"" was uploaded at the end of the month I was reminded to pay for service I was not receiving. I was bombarded by up to 8 emails monthly to pay. In the emails eBay swapped people who talked to me every time, most of them admitted technical difficulties from their side, several said to ignore Fees and wait.  After almost 3 months since issue discussed I didn't get typical invoice reminder, but an announcement about closing my account and counting late payment fees ... yes late payment for something I was advised not to pay. After 7 emails instead of admitting mistake on their side, they ""generously"" forgave me my ""listing"" debt however only after paying fees for delayed payment. So after 3 months of uncertainty and invoices, I got to pay to free myself from the Devils Contract. I am seriously upset and I wouldn't expect it from such a company. So my best advice? Save yourself some troubles, don't sell with them.",CZ

I basically sold an item to a customer who canceled the sale after it was confirmed eBay did not notify me that they had canceled it until after two days after I had already shipped this heavy item for $120. The shipping label that eBay was supposed to supply, did not work and I could not reach customer service. I was forced to spend an exorbitant amount to ship this item. Two days after I shipped it I received a message that the buyer had canceled the order then I received a notice the buyer was claiming the order the item was not working properly  And requested a refund. I tried communicating with the seller but I feel that it was a scam from the get go. Basically if a buyer cancels an order after the seller ships, and then complains that the order item is not working properly the seller loses everything. This buyer basically stole my $1500 item and eBay did absolutely nothing to resolve the matter.I feel violated- I feel betrayed -I feel taken advantage of -I feel robbed. Do not work with eBay -they suck!!!!!!!!!! I communicated extensively with the buyer and eBay via messenger but was basically given the blah blah blah.

4767,www.ebay.com,2020-11-22T11:59:07.000Z,3,Six Month Review,"I started using eBay for selling items during the first lockdown. I have mixed feelings on the matter from a seller’s point of view.  There are many positives, I use three other selling apps as well as eBay, but eBay have consistently been the app that has sold the most items for me. I have found the app to have the least number of time wasters between the four and I believe part of that is to do with the rules eBay has in place, if you bid on an item and win or if you and a buyer accept an offer, eBay has measures in place to ensure the buyer pays. If the buyer does not pay, you can make a case against them, if the buyer still does not pay by a new deadline then a “black mark” goes on their account. Whether that does anything or not, I cannot confirm but I’d like to wishfully think that means something. If you sell a lot of items on the app eBay upgrades your account, allowing you to do a few extra things in regards to selling an item. One in particular I love, is listing an item as buy it now rather than auction. I found that many people watch an item and then forget to bid at the end. The buy it now option was small fee option originally, but I use it for every item now for free.  Another thing I love is to be able to send offers to watchers using that option. I have managed to earn sales myself by offering the item slightly cheaper than its listing price.  The app itself is quite good, your page is clear by listing all your items and separating them into what’s active, sold, or unsold. As well as showing offers etc.  I have some negatives, the first would be the fees eBay charge. They have the highest fee of all the selling apps and the fee is consistent regardless of how much the item sold for. For example, if I sold an item for £2 and I sold another for £200 the fee is the same and that becomes slightly disheartening on more expensive items that eBay take a lot away from you.  Fees also have seemed to increase from my first month of selling to what they are now. I believe when I first started, they were around 10% but my last invoice showed fees of 12.5%. I can only assume that is because I sell more items than I did then but personally, I don’t think it should matter.  I think it is very greedy of eBay to take a fee on the postage price, even if you use Royal Mail or Hermes etc. The fee should be for the item itself; eBay are not getting involved in the delivery. Its method of dealing with multiple items is very dated and time consuming. I have had many users purchase multiple items and ask for combined postage. Whilst, I have no issue with that, I must use a computer to manually make an invoice. If I am at work or simply not home, the buyer must wait until I get home to use a computer because this cant be done via the app. Vinted has automatic options in place when a seller wishes to purchase multiple items, the seller is sent a “Bundle Request” which they must approve the postage for. Depop has an automatic system in place that a seller can select to combine postage, refuse it, or even apply free postage on multiple items. It’s a lot easier for both parties than what eBay offers.  I have had a few disputes with eBay, I won’t go into them all but due to the way eBay handled them it allows me to believe the following. I have read forums about eBay and many sellers say that over the years the attitude has changed from eBay being impartial and doing its part to protect sellers as well as buyers to now seeming to side with buyers. From the few disputes I have had, it came across to me that eBay didn’t seem to care and simply sided with the buyer because that is easier. I had a buyer create a case asking for a refund stating that he didn’t receive his item, I later found out that he was based in Malta, paid via the US eBay website but he had his item sent to Northern Ireland. I gave eBay the Royal Mail reference number which showed the item was delivered to the address he gave but eBay sided with the buyer and gave a refund by taking the money from my PayPal account before I even knew what they had done. I spent a long time speaking to eBay about the matter, but they didn’t seem to care. In the end I lost my item and eBay gave me the bill, despite I proved that the buyer had committed fraud.  Overall, I have mixed feelings on eBay, it definitely has positives and perks but I feel that the company itself has taken a safer/greedier path of siding with buyers despite the fact they make their money from sellers with high fees.",GB

My son just wanted his money back and now he has to do an appeal. Ebay is obviously avoiding having to speak with buyers by not having a customer service line available. The seller can literally scam people so easily on ebay because the buyer has to pay upfront for the item and trust that the seller is going to send them the item and in the condition they stated the item was in. If there is any problem with the item you have to contact the seller first, which is ridiculous  when that seller has misrepresented the item they were selling.

It looks like the buyer asked eBay to step in, and we approved the return. While we'll always ask the buyer to work with you, we don't require photo evidence before a return can be approved. The biggest reason for this is that we never rely on or request photo evidence, since it's so easy to manipulate or alter. That goes for both buyers and sellers. This buyer's return reason is covered by the eBay Money Back Guarantee, so their request was approved and they've been sent a return label. They'll have 10 calendar days to ship it back, and if they don't the request will automatically time out. Otherwise a refund will be issued once the item is delivered. ~Nikki",US

When I called them because I wasn't able to get the insurance since the buyer didn't provide what I needed, and told them they were instructing the buyer to send back shattered glass with the unbroken part of the item, they told me it was not their problem and they would not help me.

When I called them to ask for assistance, they told me that I needed to contact USPS even though I shipped the package to the buyer UPS and work with them to get it.

They have initiated a systematic practice of delayed billing which falls outside their own ability to produce records for what the bill is actually for. They can't identify the month or the item, but they nevertheless charge sellers 7-8 months later for 'Invoice adjustment' on transaction(s) that they can only narrow down to a 3 month interval from 7+ months ago. They don't provide item numbers or even a specific day. Digging into their claims, you find they have intentionally obfuscated information in their claim to make it even more difficult to determine what the charges are for. Adding to the pathetic nature of this obvious money grab, they claim the charge is too old to dispute, since it's so far back they don't have records for it. I would steer clear of this company at all costs. For my part I have deleted all my listings and will be moving away from their affiliated businesses as well.

They do not accurately portray important things like listing fees but if you dig through 10 or so knowledge base articles you MIGHT find what you're looking for so if you have a lot of stuff to list, good luck, you'll be sitting there for a few hours. They need to just shut down and go out of business already. There are at least 3 other platforms that do a better job than them easily and without all the shady and predatory B.S. of how the fees work OR they don't even have fees because their business model isn't based on a grifting scheme just to stay alive. Even Facebook Marketplace, for all the crap Facebook is guilty of, is a much more straightforward place to sell your stuff. Rot in the ground where you belong with the other dinosaurs Ebay.",US

I send them all the receive and summitted all the form that they require me to do it. After a week, they send me the note of the investigation that they can not return my money back. Yes, I accepted that they can not return the money that had used, but how about the gift cards that have not use? Ebay can not return??? Ebay just take advantage of that to keep my money. It is just suck. why they can not stop those scam people when they have the account on the ebay to claim the gift cards? poor customer service.",US
4902,www.ebay.com,2020-10-26T20:04:02.000Z,1,I sold a Mini Cooper high pressure fuel…,I sold a Mini Cooper high pressure fuel pump to a buyer who said that the pump was not working and was clogged. It came off my working personal vehicle when I hit a deer. I drove the car to the body shop where it was totaled so I know the pump was good. I requested that eBay look at all my correspondence as I requested additional information from the buyer who never responded. I asked that eBay intervene and with an hour they ruled and said I needed to refund the money and the pump needs to be sent back which is nonsense. I know with 100% certainty that the pump was functional. Mini Coopers are very complicated and typically what happens is they are misdiagnosed especially the fuel system which has two fuel pumps. I was scammed and eBay supported the scam and held my money. they deliver poor customer service while the fat cat owner raking in the money and has no clue what their company nor their employees are doing.  If EBay would have fairly evaluated the situation they would have realized that it was a scam. They did not care to take the time. Shame on you eBay. I have been a member for 20 years with impeccable feedback and will now be canceling my membership and going with the more reputable company like facebookmarketplace.

Ebay gives bad faith buyers, who refuse to pay by asking for a different payment method AFTER the auction, a first mover advantage by allowing them to give you negative feedback stating sheer lies. In turn, you are not to rate them! Ebay forces you, as a seller who pays 10% commission, to spend a ton of time with their help desk which will not retract the negative feedback, even after you show it the buyer’s emails. It will give you a link, where you can answer to the negative feedback but it won’t appear before buyer reviews it!! And your comment won’t appear on buyer’s profile and he has 10 days to do said review!! During that time your received negative feedback stays with your profile forever and harms any outstanding sales you have on Ebay. Note: You will never be able to rate the buyer on his profile. Ebay’s agent advice to me? “Never accept a buyer’s request to cancel an auction. Instead file an unpaid purchase claim. This is the only way a buyer is punished on Ebay”.

Ebay now do not reply to my requests to review the two cases.  The Ebay website has no easy way to send emails to them.

Once suspending my account, Ebay refused to inform me of how long the suspension would be. I had to turn to the internet for answers and from what I gathered it was a life time suspension. So, with no other option or any communication from Ebay, I tried opening a separate account and Ebay quickly shut it down and used it as a excuse for a life time band.

Scammers are protected by eBay, as eBay only have eyes on the bottom line...the FINAL VALUE FEE, also known as THE PROCEEDS OF CRIME when it is charged in relation to auctions KNOWN by eBay to have involved SHILL BIDDING. You know, you (if NOT in the UK, so not on the .co.uk site) are lucky (as bidders) in 1 respect, in that you CAN still access a bidders BID HISTORY ID PAGE via the BID HISTORY page of any auction, by simply clicking on the bids made THEN clicking on the encrypted ID of ANY bidder, 1 at a time ... Here you can STILL see the bidders % history of bidding with the seller in question, and its habit (if any) of bid retraction, something eBay would prefer we DON'T see...in the UK, currently Ebay can ""see"" where you are when online, via your IP ADDRESS, so can SEE when 3 sellers (well, 3 selling IDs anyway) are, so can OBVIOUSLY see when the SAME ""3"" sellers AS BIDDERS are bidding in the auctions of each other...BIDDERS & SELLER? based at  the SAME ADDRESS?? in MULTIPLE AUCTIONS??? And THIS is why I refer to eBay (no) CS & (ABsoLUTEly NO) Trust & Safety as THE THREE WISE MONKEYS.   As sellers they were placed at the same (UK) address via a courier facilitator called SHIPLY (shiply.com)  Shiply work HAND IN GLOVE with eBay, and we are able to import the eBay ITEM NUMBER to the Shiply site to facilitate (revealing it's near exact location) our own collections, as Shiply would arrange for us to receive emails from couriers interested in delivering our goods...and we take our pick. Think of it as a falling price auction, as companies vie for your business?. I'd check it out WELL in advance, possibly on an item I didn't even want (costs nothing) just to ""test the water""  Thing is, when you could place 2 bidders at the SAME address as the seller, it didn't go down well with eBay (it seems) as (I suspect) eBay told Shiply to block our ability to see the items location, while eBay blocked our ability to ENTER the bidders Bid History ID page...in the UK that is, I believe you (in the States) still can access it, yes? so it raises the question of WHO ARE eBay trying to protect, because from where I'm sitting, it LOOKS to be the SCAMMERS.",GB

Amazon has been more reliable, quicker shipping, better prices for same or equal products, immediate customer support.

The locks also fell off (fastened with screws into the cardboard!). All this happened within five minutes - and I threw the boxes in the garbage bin.

After the item was delivered they doubled the price of shipping and said it's because it went over weight and size.

The call disconnects you after telling you to find answers on the website. Today I had to videotape myself opening a box eBay sent me. The box was so light I knew it couldn't contain the laptop I had ordered. I was right. Do yourself a favor. Never accept a package if it is significantly smaller or lighter than the product dimensions and shipping weight which could be found on Amazon. A luggage scale can be helpful when you pick up or receive the package. Btw, The vendor is an Authorized Electronics Reseller. Update: eBay is not accepting phone calls at this time. If you attempt to call their support number, you will get a machine response. But customer support will give you a call if you manage to contact them through the website.

5065,www.ebay.com,2020-09-22T20:02:22.000Z,1,"eBAY GUILTY OF VIOLATING THEIR OWN WRITTEN CONDITIONS, TERMS AND POLICIES.","My review has nothing to do with the seller.  It's all about eBay.  I purchased a sewing machine that offered the Square Trade option to purchase, except the machine was listed as ""New.""  I felt I could bypass the Square Trade and go with the manufacturer's warranty, except the manufacturer's warranty was void, the manufacturer claiming that the machine was considered 2nd hand because it was sold to me by a private person, the machine having a ""Factory Remanufactured"" label on the original box from the manufacturer.  NOT eBay's fault, this part. However, I had bypassed the Square Trade, and the information on eBay's site told me in three different places that I had the option to purchase within 30 days. I tried:  Couldn't find their option links anywhere, and that was after doing an online chat with two different people, who told me to check my confirmation of purchase email, as well as my log of orders placed under my account information. A THIRD person I was switched to said, ""That is incorrect.  You have to purchase Square Trade at the time you purchase your item.""  I argued AND proved that it was in three different places on the site that eBay offers the Square Trade if purchased within 30 days, as well as the logs from two other Customer Service Representatives that I purchased an item that IS offered the Square Trade option, as well as the option to purchase within 30 days. Exhausted with the chats, I called.  The person on the line said he'd switch me to the tech department that handles the Square Trade postings for qualifying items. Yes, I have to purchase simultaneously, and No, I can not purchase within 30 days.   I proceeded to ask, ""Does the right hand always not know what the left hand is doing at this company??  WHY aren't you honoring what is clearly stated IN WRITING on your website?!""  DID NOT budge, DID NOT blink, and just like a parrot, said, ""You must purchase Square Trade at the same time you purchase the qualifying item."" THEN, the eBay Customer Service representative  proceeded to say to me ON THE PHONE that I could return the item to the seller, the seller could relist it, I could repurchase it, along with the Square Trade option. The seller and I agreed that we would go to this trouble.  AND...guess what?!?  NO SQUARE TRADE OPTION WAS OFFERED WHEN IT WAS RELISTED, NEW LISTING NUMBER.  This went on for a MONTH!  He even tried having a friend list it on a separate account.  No luck.  EBay NEVER lived up to their own posted procedural method of operation. In the meantime, all other sellers are able to offer the Square Trade agreement.  I didn't find a single machine listed that didn't offer the option, EXCEPT for the merchant I originally purchased from. DISCRIMINATION???  Yes, no question about it.  This seller was singled out, in my opinion.  He called SIX TIMES, he communicated with me, and he was told every time that it was a mistake and would show up in his listing within 24 hours. I sent the machine back, never able to repurchase with this seller.  I didn't want to purchase a machine that had zero warranty, especially a computerized one. The seller was VERY gracious, and we tried our best TOGETHER to work it out, to no avail.  I would give this seller 5 STARS:  Artistshii is the seller, who has the utmost of integrity, hanging in with this whole thing for over a month to try and rectify it. EBAY:  THIS IS ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT!  No two ways about it!  It makes me VERY leery to purchase anything of this magnitude again through your site.  You are not trustworthy, when it comes to what you post, as far as procedural practices, vs. what you actually do when it comes down to the wire.  My original purchase was August 4, 2020, and the seller and I finally gave up on September 17, 2020.  This is not forgivable.  YOU, eBAY, have violated your own conditions, terms and policies, but hey...YOU don't have to PAY for it.  The seller and the buyer have to.  He paid extra for the prepaid shipping, I lost my purchase and over a month I could've been using the machine, and you have discriminated against this seller by not living up to your own printed conditions, terms, and policies on your website, as well.

I had placed an advert for a motorhome on the 24 of July 2020- ended on 1st of August 2020 for 10 days. My intial fee of 14,98£ was properly paid after the period for which the advert was supposed to be posted for which is 14 days. A potential buyer had missclicked the ""Buy now"" button by mistake but i had attended to this issue after my 30 days of given response time since I had sold the vehicle to someone not from Ebay. I had spoken with the potential buyer but neither Myself or him can cancel the transaction, and as a result i cannot remove the advert. I had received an invoice for July of 45£ calculated as a final value fee when you sell the vehicle. On the 4th of September i was deducted 44,36 from my bank account. I had discussed this with a company representative on the 5th of September, with a promise to me that the problems will be resolved after 24 hours. When nothing was done I had tried with another representative on the 20th of September and was basically told that it does not appear on their system so i had asked for a statement to confirm if they are correct, the resolution to them was to return my initial fee to which i had disagreed to. On a third attempt today 21st of September the connection was closed without a resolution. Edit: Today 22nd of September- Seems a merchant that I have used in the past had changed their name to ""Its ad” and the amount was later added to the bank statement coincidentally around the same time that i was supposedly due to be charged 8-10 of September. Since then the advert has been removed and my initial fee was refunded, despite me refusing it.",GB

I will stick to other selling platforms because you guys clearly cannot get your act together and have provided no support help.

Then they sent me an offer of a 10% discount if I wanted to re-order the one I originally ordered. I proposed to end the drama by offering to keep the wrong product, because it would be impossible to repackage the elliptical,  if they would give me a 10% discount on the wrong product I had along with the shipping charge refund they said they already sent. In the next email Fogdog sent, they said they were applying the 10% discount to the credit card I used to pay for the wrong elliptical. I never received the shipping label, the shipping charge refund or the $50.00 discount they said they paid. Then I created a summary of Fogdog's emailed promises and my email in response. When I sent it to Fogdog in one last effort to resolve the matter, eBay sent it back saying that I ""was using abusive language."" There wasn't one 4-letter word in the entire email. I repeated the facts. I even filed a dispute with CHASE bank, for the first time ever, whose VISA card I used for the purchase. Chase contacted Fogdog who said they delivered a product, wrong product that it was, but never even contacted me, the CHASE customer. I have received a new credit card application and will be dropping the CHASE credit card that I had for 25 years. With my 810+ credit rating it should be no problem.",US

As buyers, we've had no problems. On the one occasion we did have to talk to someone (after the new owners took over) it was a pain, since she had about five words of English.  Trying to get out of their junk emails!? We kept changing the notifications and it didn't work, we'd get five or six a DAY. We had to send THEM an email saying if they didn't stop it we'd report them as SPAM harassers. That stopped it. Yesterday a friend in the US tried to buy a lap top computer with a credit card, checking out as a guest, and even though the seller advertises as taking credit cards, the transaction kept getting refused and when he finally got to talk to customer service' he was told there was 'no problem' and he ought to get a Paypal account and an Ebay account to buy the computer.

The minute you contact paypal ebay closes your case, no matter the outcome. Fast forward, with covid 19 there is no more live customer service for ebay or paypal. I tried calling, no answer all automated. So the moron that was handling my case with paypay closed my case out of stupidity? Only reason I can think of as he requested the return tracking number that I had already provided in the first email. So yeah dumbass... So since Paypal closed the case they say it can't be reopened and to contact my bank. I then contacted my bank but since it was an instant transfer (guess that's my fault trusting paypal with my bank information) it couldn't be back charged. So ebay says deal with paypal, paypal says deal with my bank, my bank says I'm SOL. Moral of the story? 16 years with 500+ positive feedback and ebay told me to bleep off. There exact words were: ""You won't receive a refund for this case."" So buddy got my money, and got his merchandise back to resell to someone else.

But that’s not the end of the scam     • eBay insists everything has to go through PayPal      • However eBay doesn’t to risk charging their commission on the customer PayPal account (as this one might be empty)     • Thus eBay charges its commission directly on the customers account conveniently forgetting that “everything has to go through PayPal and we’re two separate companies” lies. If you thought that was the end, keep on reading     • Many of my friends have (or had) PayPal accounts and pay me directly on my personal bank account     • If they want to have a PayPal account they can and if eBay wants to use PayPal as its transaction platform it’s fine too     • BUT my friends (and other companies) NEVER enforce ME (the customer) to open a PayPal account to receive the money     • eBay does solely to make more money flow through PayPal      • Why? BECAUSE it is the same company or call it a parent company or whatever name you fancy, in the end, at the top of the pyramid are the same people.   Conclusion     • eBay could very easily pay directly into their personal bank account using their own personal bank account OR     • eBay could very easily pay customers directly into their personal bank account using their own PayPal account eBay already deals with customers personal bank account to charge us. Therefore, eBay already has all customers details in their system. Enforcing customers to open a PayPal account to use their services is unnecessary for the customers but make eBay technically over charge/ charge them twice.",GB

I have explained on multiple days, with multiple people, that I have 0 connection with this other person but they refuse to acknowlege that.  They keep saying I must contact this other person, and get them to sort out their account.   I have explained that I know nothing about this person, and that if they couldn't get them to straighten out their account, how could I, a complete stranger, convince them of anything.  Using the contact info they provided, which is only the ebay user name, I sent the other person an email through ebay, explained the situation to them, and  begged them to sort out their issues with ebay.  This was a few days ago, and I have received no response.  I have all of this documented in an online chat I did with them.  I also spoke with another person on the phone, who also was no help.

I am selling a watch worth 1600 Dollars, in the United States, California. The buyer, who has 16 feedbacks, first opens a full refund request for not having received the item, I go to check the tracking number and the item is delivered three days earlier. Then the buyer asks for the return because the watch is smaller than declared in the advertisement, false declaration, as per the manufacturer's data. Then he declares that some parts are not in gold, false declaration, as per the data of the house. In the end, not knowing what excuse to use, he declares that the watch is fake. I sent a watch with a warranty from the house, plus a 12-month warranty from the date of sale !! I do not accept the return, because none of the buyer's reasons are true and it is not fair to pay 400 Customs Dollars to take back a watch in perfect condition and guaranteed. Well, eBay agreed with the buyer, refunded the payment to the buyer, and left my watch in his hands. So I lost the item and the money and we're talking about $ 1600. This is a scam and theft. I will turn to the Italian police and the Italian court and we will see if they will give me reason and justice for this unacceptable fact. If others have had the same experience, don't suffer, react and try to get justice. When a rule is wrong, it must be changed !!!",IT

It is supposed to be a secure and trustworthy website, ensuring a money back guarantee. Yet there is no customer support representatives available and if you call you are directed to the website to resolve your issue.  I was scammed out of $3000 by what appears to be one of Ebay's employees. The individual set up a fake post advertising a car and was able to access their letterhead and privacy disclosures. Not only that but the individual knew the entire process of car buying through eBay and sent correspondence from eBay motors. They requested payment in the form of eBay cards. It seemed legit. When I found out it was a scam I was sure eBay would be helpful, but to my dismay I was told they couldn't recover my funds since they weren't accountable; they told me they could only investigate and freeze the cards that they had mentioned were already redeemed. They couldn't give me any information pertaining to this individual to give to law enforcement or file a lawsuit. This has proved that eBay does not provide customer support to anyone, but the scammer who was able to get away with such an unethical practice done on their website.

For reasons eBay will not provide, our business was targeted by their ""Trust & Safety"" department, to drag us through a mind-numbing bureaucratic process of proving our legitimacy. Even with multiple successful sales and only positive reviews, eBay was convinced we were offering items that did not exist, and so demanded documentation proving ownership of our inventory. To begin this process, they halted all of our account activity, taking down currently listed items and deleting the history of every sale we'd made on the account. This made it difficult to furnish them with the requested documentation because we had no way of knowing what items we had sold on their platform without the account history. I asked them about this difficulty in every single one of the 20+ messages I sent them throughout this process, but they never answered that question. They never even acknowledged it. When I tried to send them random invoices from our vendors on what items I could only guess we sold through eBay, they only replied over and over and over again with requests for that exact same information (all of the requests looked like generic copy/paste scripts giving the impression no one was even reading my replies or reviewing my uploads). I uploaded the same documents 5 times before I finally explained to them I cannot justify spending any more time on the matter, and will seek a more efficient solution myself. Through researching how other sellers deal with the inane harassment of eBay's support staff, I found that thousands of users are abusing the system in hundreds of different ways, and not just to stay off eBay's radar in order to sell legitimately. There are many methods and tactics being used to create an unfair bidding/buying environment, avoid eBay and PayPal selling fees, redirect eBay traffic offsite etc, and those users are happily earning profits right under the noses of these ""meticulous"" watchdogs. So, while our business is taking care to follow eBay's terms of service, submit to their bureaucratic demands, and do business with eBay in a mutually beneficial partnership, other sellers enjoy a headache free and financially unfettered selling environment because the eBay support staff is so busy copy/pasting scripted requests that aim to crush a person's last nerve. There are many online selling channels to go through, and my advice is not to utilize eBay unless you are ready to be unscrupulous in your dealings.",US

Had I been the only person making a complaint about this situation with this seller, then maybe I can see eBay sticking to their policy. Given the reality that 60+ people had a problem in a short window frame, eBay should have acknowledged the problem and stood by me, the buyer. Their response was “we are independent of the seller”.

Don’t tell me it might come, remove the item from my account and refund my account. Simple easy. I had to dispute credit card charge with Visa( Capitol One). I have never had this problem and hope I never encounter it again.      You should have a working customer service number for these issues since going to your help site was not addressing my issue.

Then on top of all that you'll have endless corrupt buyers trying to con you and rip you off (my item hasn't arrived :/) As a seller if you report a buyer nothing happens, so you lose even more money and eBay is just full of people waiting to rip you off. Zero rights for sellers, you can't even leave a rogue buyer negative feedback but they can leave you unwarranted negative feedback no problem! Every negative feedback you recieve moves your items further down the pile until your sales are virtually zero. And I have to say restricting accounts is just pathetic, they treat you like a naughty child, hardly a sensible approach to business in my opinion. During uncertain times (corona) when people are relying on eBay more than ever to feed their children, restricting accounts because of officious reporting by people holding grudges (true story) without looking into the matter properly is, as far as I'm concerned not only childish but downright irresponsible. I now know I cannot rely on eBay to help me feed my family. You need regulating by a third party eBay, and the sooner the better, talk about the Wild West. Your agents are liars, they say they will get back to you in 48 hours but they don't. Any company faring this poorly on Trustpilot would want to sort things out, not eBay though, they are so full of themselves they don't even bother looking at their reviews according to this page.

The buyer claims that the upper layer containing the picture has naturally peeled apart from the cardboard layer underneath, but has done so in a manner where it's a perfectly clean cut with no other signs of distress. Puzzle pieces can certainly become frayed, bent, dented, chipped, and torn apart, but certainly not cleaved in half into separate clean cut layers the way the buyer is claiming. Even the puzzle company's customer service said this does not naturally happen. It's a flat out obvious lie from the buyer. What's worse is Ebay spent literally only 5 minutes reviewing the case before deciding in the buyers favor. I received two emails only 5 minutes apart about the dispute being up for review and then the decision.

You must return the money to the buyer, for example, 3 days after purchase, even if the delivery date is 21 days. Good news for buyers !!! If you want to get things for free, shop on eBay, because eBay always takes money from sellers and returns it to you !!! 4) eBay cheats on the seller. They wrote to me that if I send positive feedback, tracking numbers and paid the fees, sou they will renew my sales rights. Of course, this did not happen. 5) Customer service is appalling. It will cut off communication with you even though your issue is not resolved. 6) You will lose money. You buy goods, you list products. You count on selling on eBay.

The sellers complained and they listened to them without giving me a chance to show my being right. I will elaborate so that you readers will see why you should be very careful to try not to buy on ebay. For example, There was a company from Texas that I bought tons of jewelry from, through bidding. Four packages did not arrive by the due date so ebay reps told me to go into each and every item (which was a pain) and request a refund. So I did. That made it look as though I had like 60 requests open and so ebay claimed i was dishonest. But that jewelry finally only came (3 out of 4 packages) between 4-6 months later (!), probably due to Covid19. Ebay only protects you up to 30 days after the due date, so since most of the items I ordered did not come by then I HAD to request refunds or kiss my money good bye, so to speak. I even sent letters to all the sellers that if and when their products arrived, I will be happy to send them the money through paypal so they wont lose out. Ebay has to change their policy to 6 months later if they really care about their sellers and buyers, which they absolutely and foolishly don't. Now, they closed my accounts with like 10 items that never showed up and they refuse to refund me the items. Which means they are also unjust and also downright thieves. Please do be careful, buyers, only buy thorugh them if you have no choice or if you dont care about their bad behavior and about losing money.",IL

I've had sellers say.. We are putting it in writing to you, we sell authentic perfumes.  I then check their feedback page. Typically those selling authentic items will have the feedback to back them up.  I've had one problem, and because I HAD IT IN WRITING there was no question  The seller lost because the seller was dishonest and lied.  Not good to lie on paper.  I was not only refunded immediately, I was given back shipping, and the seller was striked.  A very bad thing to happen on eBay.  In closing, if you're an intelligent consumer who puts everything in writing, AND checks a feedback page, you'll never have a problem.  You'll be treated with the utmost fairness by eBay because you're KNOWLEDGEABLE and you cover your Butt thus in turn making their job easier.

For example I sold €150 - eBay hit me with an invoice of €22, so realistically I only made €128, but let’s not forget those items I sold also needed to be posted off and packaged. So Ireland’s postal fees are through the roof, an post delivery service is really expensive. So I probably made €80 in the grand scheme of things. But to make it even WORSE half the items sold in selling for average price as I needed to declutter. The only ones making money, taken advantage is EBAY!!! Now they have an enrolling listing system. For example you’re only allowed “50 ads for free” (nothing is for free) but you decide to stick up 55 and are charged an extra 50c that’s no probably but now they have an enrolling system that can’t be stopped.

This is totally unacceptable and unpredictable.  You SHALL INFORM customers that they may need to pay 5 % to Paypal even if the transaction is cancelled. Any other services, such as Google Pay and even China Aliexpress understands this, but EBay do not.  I highly recommend you to think this through before someone brings up a class action against Ebay.  I am not going to do so, because my losses are small, but if someone else might. From customer's perspective this feels really annoying and do not gain trust to Ebay at all. Fortunately most of times everything works fine, but perhaps these cancellations will be more frequent due to COVID-19 and therefore processes needs to be robust, audited and shall pass legislation too."" and they responded: ""Thanks for reaching again us here on eBay.

This is how professional the people from Ebay seem to be and why it seems to pay off to be a thief on this site. This is mega frustrating for me. Story: - I won an auction for a Nikon Z6 from user domy161 and article ID: 184380313253 - payment specified as bank transfer - He contacts me and tells me he sends me his bank account and name inside a screenshot in the ebay messages (this screenshot is in fact a snippet of 3 lines from Wordpad, perhaps did not want to write it as text so that some of the automatic screening of ebay does not pick it up) - It has a name:  vladislavs kalinka and an IBAN: ES91 6713 0002 5900 0824 4681 - Article inside ebay is specified as being in: Ambonil, France - IBAN from above is from Spain => first red flag -> in Europe this is very very very very uncommon and to have a bank account in another country you need to have the physical residence also there - I can bet that the domy161 account is not registered under this Vladislavs Kalinka guy's name - I ask for video verification of the article before doing the payment -> answer I get: ""you saw my conditions in the ad, this is not possible, send me the payment"" -> second and BIG red flag - He told me to make the bank transfer and not specify in comments anything related to our auction as if I do he will be taxed by the authorities (this is a lie as I know the tax system in both France and Spain and no one looks in bank comments). On the other hand if you open a case with your local police, the local police contacts the police in another country, then if it reaches the bank and they see nothing to tie a transaction to the internet purchase- > then it becomes close to impossible to get your money back -> 3rd flag - the guy listed since 5 days the exact same article again as he saw he cannot fool me and he is baiting yet another naive user  -> 4th flag - the guy's account only has feedback as a buyer for small stuff and then suddenly this selling for an expensive article (this is a typical strategy to gather very very good feedback and then claim legitimacy and seriousness so that you can be psychologically pushed to do a payment despite red flags) Ebay behavior: - customer support from US -> agreed with me -> opened a case with the Fraud team -> told me to also do the same - I signaled also the ad as a fraud 5 days ago -> no news - I did it again via their support in France 3 days ago -> no news In the meantime the ""fake seller"" continues to do his stuff unhindered and does not really care. Ebay is too slow to react and thus here one can find the ""Den of Thieves"". I hope that what I write can help others avoid scams and use common sense and a bit of investigative skills. Ebay won't protect you if they take weeks to reply or investigate. You have to be the first one to take care.",CH

This is simply false where sellers set distant delivery dates, as ebay responds saying they just can't process the refund and it's just tough luck, even though the guarantee assures it. The latest is that I purchase a parcel of electronics for about R600, order number 23-04667-26392. I opened a case 1 day after the latest delivery date saying that the items had not arrived, and asked for a refund. The seller contacted me repeatedly, saying he'd refund but never did. Continual promises from the seller but no refund. I clicked the ask-ebay to step in button, but it had an error. I contacted ebay, who said I had not opened the case within 30 days of the latest delivery date, which was a lie. I showed them that the latest delivery date was 28 June and I opened the case 29 June, 1 day later, well within the 30 days. Why does ebay lie? Ebay responded that their system no longer allows the processing of a refund. The same old response. This is unacceptable, you have a buyer protection guarantee, and it's on ebay to uphold it. It's unacceptable to just refuse based on your system not allowing you, after guaranteeing you will refund when I made the purchase and after I adhered to all the refund terms. The tracking number RV367840711CN still shows the parcel was last in China, and hasn't been updated since then. It's been 4 months, and I expect ebay to honor their promise and refund me for this order, rather than making excuses. My next step is a chargeback with my credit card company, which route I don't want to go, as they indicated they'll blacklist ebay and I will no longer be able to purchase through ebay. I've been a long time ebay customer, but if ebay is no longer honest in their dealings, then I will shop elsewhere. I shouldn't have to go this route, and it's sad that ebay is being so dishonest and treating a customer so unfairly.",ZA

Ebay allows these Chinese scammers to operate without any repercussions because they want to continue to access the massive Chinese market. Basically, these Chinese sellers list their ""product location"" as a city in California when in actuality the goods are being imported from China. They list items as new and sell used items in counterfeit factory packaging. However, the same sellers get tons of good feedback on small $1 transactions for cheap items they do actually have in the US. In this way, the negative feedback they get for the high dollar scams is offset by the positive feedback for the many small transactions. Ebay then protects them as ""power-sellers"" and bans buyers accounts who leave them negative feedback or return too many counterfeit items. I sincerely hope that Ebay becomes obsolete and is dominated by other e-commerce platforms.",US

5380,www.ebay.com,2020-07-17T15:48:28.000Z,5,Ebay is a safe place to shop,"Ebay is a great place to shop. I have been a member for many years and I highly recommend it. I have met some great sellers, some excellent deals, and I can find just about everything I am looking for.  When you run into problems, someone is always there to help  you. I have made a couple of purchases, where I can honestly tell you I was scammed. Others, where the merchandise was never received and I kept believing the seller until the case closed and all seemed lost. Thankfully, when you contact ebay they will review the entire case. They look at the history, they look at the emails (this is why it is important to always do all communication through the ebay website) they make a thorough investigation and have been able to help me each and every time.  In my experience, customer service has been very helpful, patient, knowledgeable and above all WILLING to help. Believe me when I tell you they will listen to you. No matter how frustrated you get with a purchase they will ALWAYS listen. As a buyer this is very important because it tells me that they care to about having a safe and honest place to shop. But fair for they will only make a decision after reviewing all of the evidence. This takes away the arguing back and forth between seller and buyer. Meaning, there is less of a chance of scammers getting away with their games. I love it, and I highly recommend it.",US

You can imagine my surprise when a tracking email was sent stating the purchase was coming from China.  Ok, yet after a couple times attempting to reach the seller no response, no email, no nothing.  I have a feeling that I was dubbed by Ebay and the fake Chinese company into buying the game.  It is truly disgusting what Ebay allows to happen on its site.  However after doing a little research I discovered it is owned by some person from California now residing in Hawaii living the life on working class Americans with immunity for  his a  companies action.

Often time sellers get a tracking number long before the shipping takes place and other times when items that show positive tracking results were, In fact, not received by the purchaser eBay sides with the seller. It is impossible to file a lost claim with UPS unless you know the sellers information used during shipping and eBay stands behind those sellers when they refuse to either provide information to the buyer so the buyer can file a claim or when the seller just flat out ignores the buyers requests for help. Ebay assumes fudicial responsibility in these matters and their actions fall short of a responsible fiduciary and I question ebays ethics as well as company policy.",US
