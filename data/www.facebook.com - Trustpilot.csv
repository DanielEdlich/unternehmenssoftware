In recent times Facebook has implemented ""Suggested for you"" which suggests similar businesses, pages, posts, etc., on Pages as well as personal feeds. As an owner of a handful of pages I was not advised that they were doing this, and found out that people viewing the pages are being shown posts for other pages/groups instead of being shown the posts for the actual page they are viewing. In one page (if not more) the suggested posts were completely unrelated as they took one word out of the page description and used it out of context as the sole basis of the ""suggestions"". Facebook's response would no doubt be something like ""but we gave you a way to opt out of the suggested posts"". Of course they are technically true - but the way to opt out involved going into each page 1 by 1 and clicking through multiple screens to get to the relevant option. When you get to the correct page, the actual option to deselect is cryptic - you are required to deselect the option to suggest your page on other pages, with a by-product of that selection being that other pages are not suggested on your page. As for suggestions appearing in your personal feed (or when logged in as a Page), tough luck. There is no option to turn it off, instead it tells you that you can hide posts you don't want to see. This doesn't help at all as it just suggests an almost identical post from  another person/page.

You see the same telegram scam bots everywhere lately and the usual 'Go to this person's Instagram to get your page/account back' scams, but when you report them literally nothing happens because Facebook says it's 'not against the rules'.. Are you shitting me? So you're telling me that it's totally fine for these clowns to hack your page/account and there's nothing that you're able to do because it's not against the rules? What a utter joke. 2. If your account/page is hacked, Facebook will do literally nothing to help you recover it. They don't even know who you are yet they have all your data which they sell off to other websites/platforms itself such as Google. 3. Apparently it's okay for pages to post 'sexual suggestive' content but when you do it on your own Facebook account, you literally get banned for 30 days because of 'sexual suggestive content' ? What a joke. 4. They are doing nothing against bots (Same as YouTube) who are promoting scams on their website. 5. People can say the most heinous stuff possible on Facebook and nothing will happen but when i call someone a idiot/moron, i get banned for 30 days because of 'Harassment/violence and terrorism' ? Are you kidding me? (And yes this actually happened once). 6. 0 ways of actually directly communicating with their support which should be a basic feature of any website, especially social media websites/platforms. 7. A broken mobile app that hasn't seen any improvement for a long time now... I'm still having the same issues over and over where the mobile app will randomly throw me out and ask me to sign in again, why is this STILL a thing?

I know they steal my data and manipulate me in many ways but it is a good way to share what is going on in our lives with our friends and family so I have stuck with it. Last year I started posting music and videos every day. These posts are important to me and I've used them to share about our lives and to teach others. Facebook automatically creates a memories list and shows posts from prior years and this list is neglecting to include these posts. Again, these posts are very personal and important to me, and I've spent a lot of time on them. I post every single day, almost like an online video blog. It's infuriating and discouraging that Facebook is purposely leaving them off of my memories list. They're doing it on purpose because even third party apps like Time Hop can't find them. I have reported the problem a dozen times and nobody at Facebook has gotten back to me so it's obvious that not only do they know about it, they're not going to do it anything about it.

I personally do not care about this FB account & I feel that FB in addition to their history concerning users privacy, etc. is acting on me because I keep voicing out about the on-going negative experiences I have with Walmart.ca since Sept/22 & of course I contribute $0 to FB's profit while Walmart.ca easily be giving much much more incomes & profits for FB. To me, FB is acting as if they are muting my voice on their platform on behalf of a giant international business customer. Well, it is very much how this world runs & operates------REAL ""justice"" remains an impossible ideal & is very much only for the super powerful & rich, rarely for financially & politically marginalized us. But, there are many other choices that I can still voice out. Therefore concerned people at FB & WALMART.CA, CAN YOU SHUT ME UP FOR GOOD EVERYWHERE PERMANENTLY  ??????",CA

I have spent the last couple of days reinstalling the files on the new hard drive as well as reinstating accounts where passwords have been lost.  Every other organisation has sent codes to reset passwords, but not Facebook. My profile photograph, e-mail and telephone number is displayed but despite asking on numerous occasions for codes to be sent none have arrived.   I run a Facebook Page for a local non-profit making marine conservation area that Facebook treats as a business.  Every time I post on the Page, Facebook tries to sell advertising saying that if I pay ¬£14 the post will be boosted to reach more people, but I doubt what they say.  How can you possibly trust Facebook with this, or anything else, if they can‚Äôt even send codes to recover an account?   Anyone who tries to run a business solely on Facebook is misguided to say the least.

I had over 400 posts on marketplace.... hundreds of hours.  All lost. Tried to argue with the Bots many times and the loop goes round and round like a hamster wheel.  Facebook is shameful.  First they hook you and then kick your behind out for stupid reasons.  For someone who has 400 posts and uses the platform a LOT,  there should be a ratio of percentage of the minor mishaps vs the use put in play.  Three strikes for minor offenses should have a time limit clock even if one year freeze rather than total termination.  Where is the FB Customer service people?  Humans???",CA

I live alone in a remote area and nowhere near my family. I used Facebook as a way of communicating with friends and family.  Their Admin Team who are meant to respond to complaints or are quick to block you, in most people's opinion don't know what they are doing.  Yesterday (17/11/22,  I had a lot of issues with bullying on the Ritchie Sunak Group.  This group to be honest has a majority of Indian followers and hardly any from the UK. Yesterday I was subject to bullying, hate speech, and racism.  I reported it to Facebook because one person said a dreadful thing about mutilation to me and then he removed it as it was so awful.  I reported it to Facebook and they send a standard response saying this does not go outside of our regulations!!  In addition on Remembrance Weekend, there were the most disrespectful and awful comments about our war heroes.  Again I reported and nothing, just it's within our rules so perhaps these people have no idea how people sacrificed their lives for us.  This week I shared a post regarding our war veterans and what they mean to the world but the group would not approve it!  I complained again but nothing.  You could even say that as this group only exists to worship Ritchi Sunak, they don't want to know the truth.  The group is also full of begging posts asking us for money and they think Rishi is Indian but he was born in the UK!  This can't continue to section out British people and individuals posting hate speech.  Yesterday I got called Ugly, and fat, my dogs look better than me plus racist comments towards white people.  Facebook Admin doesn't listen and act on issues!  Sadly I have to continue to use it and don't like Instagram so I have no choice.",GB
189,www.facebook.com,2022-12-15T09:32:14.000Z,1,Facebook Metaplatforms Stealing Money from Advertising Partners!,"If you are one of the advertising partners placing paid ads, there is a good chance Facebook incorrectly charged your credit or debit card, your Paypal or your bank account. That's what happened to me. And the process of getting your money back is next to impossible when you try to resolve the issue directly with Facebook. Most people tend to take the fight up with their credit card company to get the charges reversed, but in this case it won't work, because the charge was placed by METAPLATFORMS to my Paypal account, but because at the time when METAPLATFORMS was placing the charge, my Paypal account balance was $0.00 (zero). So Paypal has sent the Facebook's charge into my bank account. What's strange (bizarre) that neither Paypal nor Facebook did not invoice me for the charge and did not document it at all. I can't report it as FRAUD to my bank since the charge came via Paypal and Paypal is not cooperating well since the charge went into my bank and is undocumented by Paypal. While Facebook or Meta Platforms or Meta or whatever else name they disguise themselves under and their ads payment support  and all this maze of Facebook/Meta supports denies the charge and is asking for a reference number for that particular unauthorized undocumented uninvoiced charge while there is NO reference number under my bank account, only the following description: INST XFER ID:METAPLATFOR INDN:""MYFIRSTLASTNAMEHERE"" CO ID:PAYPALSI77 WEB Other Payment"". I have provided this and screenshots to Facebook, but they are foiling throwing kicks and are ignoring my evidence. Clearly they must have allegedly charged millions or billions of users for the same or similar amount just to make more money. And Facebook has already charged me for a legally INVOICED (documented and agreed upon) amount for the ad they were running for me for a limited period of 7 days (and a full stop). This is a NIGHTMARE and I have now blocked Facebook from being able to remove even more money from my Paypal and bank accounts by removing Paypal payment method from my Facebook business ads page, but now Facebook posted the following under ""Go to Account Quality"" which is located under /accountquality/ ‚Äî ACCOUNT RESTRICTED ""We couldn't process one of your payments. Pay the amount due to run ads again."" and ""Can't run ads"" ‚Äî not that I want to use Facebook Ads (Meta whatever) ever again though! Beware!",US

But yesterday I logged into the Group and it was gone, all that was there was a notice saying, ""This content isn't available at the moment"". Then I receive an email from Facebook saying that the Facebook Group has been disabled. And that my Group has been reported multiple times for violating someone else's intellectual property rights and that I had been previously warned that if content posted to my Group continued to infringe the intellectual property rights of others, my Group would be disabled. I remember something a long while back mentioning something to that effect but when I clicked on the message to see what it was it didn't mention anything or show me the thing I ""supposedly"" infringed upon and so I put it down that it had been fixed as there was no information about anything. I do not know what Facebook expects people to do if there is complaints about infringement or anything for that matter if they do not give the people any information to rectify the problem. We are not ""mind readers"". I am dumbfounded by the way Facebook conducts itself in matters like this, because all they had to do was say we have had some complaints about this thing or that thing, and then show me what it is and then I would have fixed the problem, and there wouldn't have been any drama. But no, they had to do the whole song and dance routine and act tough by deleting my Facebook Group to show just how spiteful they really are. I do not know who hires the Staff at Facebook but they certainly need to be fired and the Staff retrained because other Facebook Groups can have Bestiality, Animal Abuse, Sex Scenes, Drug Selling posts in their Groups and Facebook does nothing, yet I have some type of infringement of an unknown nature, of which Facebook won't explain and I get my whole Group of 21 thousand members deleted.....""Totally Idiotic!""",AU

So called   News feed's dripped in spam over load  from attention seekers I don't know and hope I never do. Most of the feeds are designed to stimulate , a strong comment. However Zoo Book likes to whip the negativity in the comments section to the point where the animal's (users) , rattle the cage and then the mods get out their stick and ban   a lot of comments that don't fit their main priority. Greed vested interest. Like most platforms they whip up a toxic level of hatful reactions and then either shadow ban the entire section  or manipulate time lines to suit the elites. Always click on show all comments to get a better picture of public  sentiment.  Silly comments are allowed , untruthful comments are often allowed like the one about Refuges living in five star hotels especially if the lie is about someone without influence or money.  Spam and Scam comments filter through without issue on every other comments section. Even though they are off topic irrelevant and possibly harmful to those who click the links.  They seem to suck up your personal data like  a lizard on the wall as soon as you set up an account your device gets logged and your comments and content is their manipulative hands. They decide what gets seen and what get's hidden , what get's retained and who's comment's are promoted usually idiotic and partisan ones to keep the grade low. Basically if you like speaking out about your own government when they get stuff wrong and it goes unchallenged  Facebook is not for you. The desperate legacy  media seem to be up Facebooks rear as do a lot of virtual signalling  charities and institutions , who'd rather keep virtual signalling while getting away with censorious and corrupt practices.    They're for there are a lot of hyperbole Facebook scandals get a superficial run  in the papers but next to no  insightful reporting on shadow bans and political censorship.  Unless it's happening to a global rival. Many media editors seem to do well out of Facebook  pages as they get to orchestrate a false public consensus over many matters.   Oh yeah , then there are the fake interests groups be they about your favourite TV prog or sports teams run by so called fans with a mountain of rules , which they can't even abide by themselves basically I posted something that was not a photo in one a bit off topic , a group admin did the same with an equally irrelevant post and this was allowed.  Like many other platforms Facebook is a toxic hypocrisy of a social network. I doubt Zuckerberg cares for anyone but himself and his own power. The media lap up Facebooks crocodile  tears about safe spaces and freedom of speech the way the media of a dictatorship would.  Manny call Facebook leftwing and communist I disagree , it's nothing of the sort it's capitalism at it's worst.

A few days before Thanksgiving I noticed posts that I did not post. I changed my password immediately. Thanksgiving Day while with family and not using Facebook a family member asked me about something I had just posted. I was not on my Facebook at the time. Yet I posted a four-bedroom house that I supposedly had for rent. I currently live in a bus. Any thoughts? The next day while chatting with a friend on messenger I received a notice that I had posted material that went against community standards. Within minutes I received a second notice that my account was locked and blocked from view. I at once began attempting to fix the issue. I had not posted anything; I was chatting with a friend. I at least wanted to see what I had apparently posted. I could not even find my account. Very upset I decided I would sleep on it and fix it the next day. It is now five days later, and I have attempted every support help fix I have found and called every number I have found. I have even uploaded a copy of my state ID to prove I am who I say I am. I did manage to see a partial view of the post and from what I could see I do fully agree that whoever posted it should have to deal with this. Not me. I continue to get a ‚Äúsent code to phone and that it could take a few minutes‚Äù message only no code is ever sent, if a code is requested too many times it will lock, so I‚Äôm stuck waiting for a code. I requested code to change my password and I did receive code for that. I have changed my password several times over the last week. I eventually become angry and log out, and that‚Äôs when I get a message telling me my account is locked and that I have so many days to request a review. I have tried to find where and how to request a review. I found a section in the help guide that asked me to upload my ID, so I did. Received the message it could take up to 24 hours for them to look at it and decide if they were wrong they will unlock my account , if they decide that I am wrong than I will be banned. I have had my account for several years and never have I had any problems. I will be more than happy to provide all my personal information. I have not been asked any questions as to did I post this? Where am I located? Nothing. I have a large number of people that would gladly verify anything about me or anything I have ever posted on Facebook. I can even provide a list of people that do not like me that would verify the same as those that do.  I do think Facebook was right to block the post. Although I strongly feel that before they lock someone‚Äôs account for review they should provide details of the steps the person should take to provide information that I feel should be included in that review. Much like so many others in the world Facebook is my contact with my family and friends. One difference for me is that due to my challenges with Agoraphobia at times it is my only contact with any one outside my home. Facebook has been the only contact I have had with the outside world for weeks at a time on many occasions. I am not upset that this happened. What I am upset about is the process Facebook is using. I have years of photos and Tags that people have sent me over the last several years attached to my Facebook account that will be lost if Facebook decides to delete my account. I feel like a child that is being punished for someone else‚Äôs actions. I am not even given the opportunity to speak on my behalf much less defend myself. Wait that is what‚Äôs happening only difference is I‚Äôm an adult. Great Moral Ethics Facebook!  Horrible Parenting! There is a right way to handle things. Then there seems to be the Facebook way.

Thumbs up/down have been used since Roman times. I‚Äôve seen thumbs up/down on other websites. I am not a lawyer but I think trademarking an icon as facebook did is not the same to me as having buttons on a remote in someone's home or trademarking a distinctive app icon to represent a company.

I then had every scammer in the world bombard me with emails and Facebook requests. I thought I better report it and get this stopped but seemed Facebook thought Scammers were not a problem on their platform and why would it be it‚Äôs an advertising platform not a social connection site well not anymore. So Facebook sat back making their usual revenue while I spent at least 2 full days trying to block as many unsavoury scammers as possible with no help from Facebook who ignored my pleas exhausted afterwards I logged in and found more pages full of scammer requests all from mostly third world and some of the pictures were very violent and disturbing so reported them to Facebook with images. Still no stepping in and then I woke up and smelt the coffee yet another big company that cares not about it‚Äôs users but the big bucks from bombarding you with adverts in fact I couldn‚Äôt even read the posts I wanted because between blocking scammers day after day and being bombarded with FB adverts I realised it wasn‚Äôt a nice place run by nice ethical people and closed my Facebook down . That wasn‚Äôt the end of it though because Facebook scammers still had my email account and so would fill up my email inbox with things like the usual if I contacted this email I‚Äôd receive a large sum of money and all manner of disturbing scams and some on investigation were not third rate little scammers but huge sophisticated organisations of criminals that were dangerous! I reported all this to action fraud and eventually it slowed down. That‚Äôs my experience of Facebook and as you have probably guessed will not be returning to scammer paradise again edit I forgot to add I had another Facebook account a long time ago and the reason I left it so long before testing the waters again with Facebook was because that account was hacked and I was locked out of it,GB

I NEVER received an email about their final decision, but here is the EXACT text of what they wrote when I tried to log in my brand new account: ""You can't use Facebook or Messenger because your account, or activity on it, didn't follow our Community Standards. We have already reviewed this decision and it can't be reversed. To learn more about the reasons why we disable accounts, visit the Community Standards."" No reason.

It was our first time away skiing and we were a little anxious about travelling during the pandemic. However, Martina and Mark ensured we had all the correct paperwork and insurances in line to help us travel with ease. The accommodation was a real hit. Both comfortable and stylish. With a very cool leisure area down below called the ‚ÄòRave Cave‚Äô we had plenty to enjoy at night with games and an extensive selection of DVD‚Äôs.  The food selection and menu planning was diverse and delicious. With a 10 and 14 year old we were unsure we would find something that we all agreed on but we had plenty to delight us and Mark and Martina cooked it beautifully. We were meant to have one night in, but the food was so delicious we decided to stay home. Mark and Martina were wonderful hosts and very generous with their time, help and advice ensuring we had our excursions booked and in place.  A truly wonderful holiday and we will absolutely return.

Basically I only use Facebook because most mobile games use this to sync data between different devices or to create accounts, and I find it ridiculous. And the following must change without questioning. First, it‚Äôs almost impossible to create an account. You have about an 1/10 chance to success without extra verification, and ‚Äúdisagreeing‚Äù that we didn‚Äôt ‚Äúviolate their Community Standards‚Äù, while we did absolutely NOTHING wrong, but just trying to create an account. And those extra steps include a PHOTO of our FACE, which some employees will see and use to verify the account, which is unacceptable. This kind of steps must be removed. Second, the primary location, which is not possible to change. And don‚Äôt think this is only visible to you. Anyone there working on Facebook can see that like all your stored data on your account. And the fact that this location is impossible to change makes the user experience worse, by providing location-based feeds that don‚Äôt interest them, because this is not what they want to see, or it‚Äôs not in a language they understand. Living in a country doesn‚Äôt mean they can speak *that* language. Two settings must be added: one to change the primary location, the second to use a chosen primary language or country for personal feeds (including ""people you may know"") instead of something location-based. Third, there are tons of useless settings and texts, a lot could be grouped together or just removed, because we are all lost in there and we don‚Äôt have time to always check everything. This should really be reviewed. Last, I am often hearing about censoring there in other reviews. Personally I still didn't try to post anything, but this looks very disappointing.",US

After the data breach and all the millions of accounts that were hacked recently, you would think Facebook may have taken account security more seriously.  But apparantly not it seems.

598,www.facebook.com,2022-05-30T02:22:56.000Z,1,Facebook...soon to be a thing of the past?!?,"As both a business owner and user of Facebook, it is my belief that they care not of decency and basic humanity. I'm not even making this up, they literally reward people who stay on the platform for hours on end, and punish those who do not. So if you happen to have a life where you can't be glued to their platform for hours on end, you're probably experiencing a decline in your reach and engagement on your posts these days. On the opposite end, if you're the type who spends hours on Facebook posting every meal, every life event, and gets lost in Stories, and memes, etc, then it's likely you love Facebook because you're not experiencing the same penalties as those who don't or can't spend that kind of time on the platform. Their extraordinarily strict policies and plethora of algorithms are destroying businesses by the handful. Those who aren't in this category are oblivious to this fact. It's unfortunate that SO many fellow business owners, to include myself, are being restricted and blocked from running Ads, and worse, simply because of errors in their algorithms. My account was restricted for over 6-months (I couldn't run a single Ad), and after multiple requests for review I finally received an email response saying my account was restricted in error and has been restored and ""sorry for the inconvenience"". However, by that time my business was already severely impacted and my Ads never performed the same again (likely because of one or more algorithms perpetually attached to my profile). I found out (from a ""Facebook Ad Expert"") the lack of performance is likely because all my customers and clients and potential leads who were attached to my pixel had fallen off because of the extended time. So I basically had to start from scratch to build that pixel back up. Similarly, my personal account remains restricted because it was never resolved and I was told, also via email (because that's the only support available) there was nothing they could do. All it would take to resolve this issue would be to speak with an ACTUAL PERSON. Since that's not an option with Facebook anymore, unless you happen to be among the elite, an 8-figure or more business owner, honest business owners like myself have to suffer. I'm currently shifting my business model to operate without Facebook, and unless someone with a higher moral conscience than ""Z"" and his fellow billionaire and millionaire executives takes over, I'm done.  Let's really think about this for a second: As of the date of this post, Facebook has a total of 11,171 reviews on Trustpilot‚Ñ¢. Of those reviews, only 14% of them are 5 stars and 68% of them are 1 star (2, 3, and 4 stars are 5%, 6%, and 7%, respectively). That speaks volumes! Sure, I'll check the little box at the bottom of this text box that says ""Let Facebook know about your review..."" My guess is that I won't ever hear from anyone to discuss resolution and my Facebook accounts will likely be completely shut down in retaliation. Then I'll have to post another 1 star. Prove me wrong Facebook, and I'll change/update my rating. Otherwise, it's only a matter of time before karma bites you in the booty.",US

So I give them still a medium critic.  However, I hope someone from the company is overlooking critics and perhaps it will help to solve some of the now arriving  problems.  Since Facebook has taken over other social media the advertising appears to be getting out of hand.  OK,  again, if you get something for free, someone has to pay for it.  In cases like Facebook and a few other social media the free page is produced through advertising.   Here is what is critical if it comes to advertising that actually is ruining the freedom of my so called profile wall.  When I   go shopping I don't have to enter stores I don't want.  If I get commercial at home, I can shut them down.   Facebook  has an option to remove the advertising you don't like.  But for every removal, Facebook will give you 2 fresh once  back to clutter my news feed.  Before, I was  able to choose my own subjects.  Now, they just put them in my news feed even if I  have just turned one of the same type off.   Facebook, please return to your old ways and let us choose what we like to see.  Don't push garbage and spam on your members.   Privacy law in groups or on your profile gets violated by Facebook more than enough right now.  Yes, Facebook violates our rights  to freedom of speech. (clean speech)  I host a few genealogy groups and lately,  when ever I post something that includes War, American Soldiers and historical facts,  Facebook removes it with the announcement of violation of the Facebook standart.   I had to  go after them in a few cases,  because I am very careful what I post and I don't post against their standard because I post with common sense.     Facebook, it is time to learn your history before you act out of control.  Last thing on my critic list is the fact that I get posts from friends that use   pre-written posters from people or  companies that should not be able to post at all.   I grew up in a home without foul language.   Or as we called it ""Street language.""  I feel that everybody can do what they want to do.  However, when I open up my facebook in the morning and find already posters with a head line that goes deep into street language,  I feel that I don't even want to be on Facebook anymore.  if I don't want to see it I need to turn it off and in many ways I am not sure why people are allowed to post this in the first place since many Post have the type of language that is supposed to be against Facebook's policy.  The title often alone is in violation of Facebook's standard,  but people still post it because they think some of the stuff is cool.  I have to admit,  that not everything is what the title says.   But often the title comes across as disrespect toward your friends.   Here, censorship of speech should be used.   Facebook, watch what you let into your door with ready made posters.    I would not be a Facebook user anymore if I wouldn't have committed myself to help others with their genealogy and  to keep in contact with family members.   However, I keep my promises even if I feel offended almost every day.  It is getting  harder to be helpful with so much uncensored filth that is coming up on Facebook now.

Made a second account with my real name (just like the first one) and didn't had major problems until in 2019 - 2020 when they decided to lock some of my account facilities like commenting, liking posts not only once but many, many times just because apparently some of the comments I write way back doesn't conform to their ""community standards"" saying that I harrassed or intimidate people when all I did was, for example to just say that someone was ugly. Sure, it's not a nice thing to say but I hardly doubt that this can be considered as ""harassment and intimidation"". And using this excuse they crippled my account many times.

HERE IS THE BIGGEST SCAM: When you finally do get someone via email and ask where your money is, they'll sometimes say your money was deposited into your bank on a specific date. When you call the bank to verify, the bank will tell you they never received any deposits from Facebook.  Yes, this happened several times including today with me.

663,www.facebook.com,2022-05-10T21:39:39.000Z,1,My Instagram Account Was Disabled for NO REASON!,"Like many others here, my Instagram account (that‚Äôs linked to my Facebook account) has been disabled for absolutely no reason but ‚ÄúMeta‚Äù claimed that it‚Äôs because I violated their terms which I did no such thing. I woke up one day and got a popup asking me to verify my phone number, so I did and enter a code they sent me then BAM, my account was locked out and they told me to wait 24 hours. First, let me start by saying I NEVER had issues with Facebook or Instagram. They‚Äôre collecting data and learning from me as a cost for me using their platform and I‚Äôve accept that. I accepted their changes, their consistent pushy ads, their bugs, glitches, and everything else. But this is going TOO FAR. I‚Äôve read on so many places online, app reviews, Reddit posts where many people have also gotten their Instagram or Facebook account suspended for no reason. Keep in mind, I‚Äôm a very average user who shares my creative content (nothing with violence, nudity, or anything offensive). I‚Äôm the most average Instagram user that uses the platform to keep up with artists, following many awesome pages and to have group conversations with friends and family. Secondly, this is atrociously irresponsible of Meta/IG/FB to suspend accounts just because they programmed some bot that mistakenly flags people for innocent things or for no reason at all (in my case). They disable accounts instantly with no warning but yet with all the data they collected, all the money they make from ad spend, marketing and transactions, they can‚Äôt have at least ONE call center with humans to look through these cases and reactivate accounts which takes probably a click of a button?!?!! They literally don‚Äôt care about their user-base or community whether you pay them or not hence why customer support is a foreign concept to them! Thirdly, I‚Äôve tried submitting numerous forms for weeks. I‚Äôve submitted humiliating photos of myself holding up a handwritten sign per their instructions at least 7 times and submitted my ID to them 3 times only to be ignored over and over again. I‚Äôm flipping infuriated right now and I‚Äôve heard this happen to people in the past. I never thought it would happen to me but since it happened, I‚Äôve been nothing but angry. I feel like a portion of my social life has been robbed from me. Many people reading this might think that‚Äôs over exaggeration but I‚Äôm in my early 30s, I‚Äôm introverted and I have a lot of mental burden I‚Äôm dealing with. Sharing and posting on IG and connecting with other artists around the world was my way to cope. I‚Äôve lost it all in a blink of an eye! I cannot create a new account because I don't have a separate phone number or email that i could use since my contact details are still connected to the disabled account. Also, making a new account and trying to regain all my data from the past 12 years manually is just too much work! FYI: There's scammers and spammers everywhere on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media with people claiming they could hack and get your account back. These jerks are spamming this everywhere, trying to mislead people into thinking they can retrieve accounts. Then, there's others who ""know people at IG"" and try to charge thousands for getting accounts reactivated for you. IG claims they don't allow this but if they can't even help us, why would they care about their employees extorting users?! I cannot believe this has been an on-going problem for so long and IG just brushed it away. How do we know these people who work at IG aren't the ones disabling accounts and then extorting users to pay for it back?!",US

The problem is, due to the aforementioned problems, the system starts off adverts without authorisation, it duplicates adverts and it charges both daily and monthly, once a limit is reached, but at the same time, it is almost impossible to review the adverts and trace the problem. One wrong move, one keystroke - and you have started an advert off, which can be difficult to stop. Worse than that, when you eventually manage to navigate the rats maze that is the procedure for communicating with this communications company, they absolutely refuse to admit error. Fighting to win back refunds for overcharging is SO time consuming that it negates the benefit of advertising at all. This service is terrible and its failings far outweigh the gain.

One woman told me to get Cancer and die and I reported her and Facebook said it was perfectly acceptable what she said. I called her disgusting and Facebook banned me and actually deleted my account completely. Bullying on Facebook is a truly staggering problem, plus now you can't actually get through to any customer service staff you can only leave site feedback so Facebook don't want to know if you need any help. Even if you click on the help function it actually does nothing more than leave feedback.  People can report you for disagreeing with them too and Facebook can ban you for bullying for simply disagreeing. I was banned earlier this year for saying ""sorry I don't agree with that"", the woman became furious that I disagreed and reported me and Facebook banned me.  I'd say Facebook isn't a site anyone should use nowadays and society needs to go back to how it was before the internet, advertise for friendss or love in the newspapers or in chip shops. Real life meet up groups, get each other other's phone numbers and be real friends not virtual friends. Depression, obesity, suicides etc...all higher now than before social networkign and social media was created, why?

I spent 2 years building an Instagram account from scratch, it recently was stolen in a hack and is posting bitcoin posts.  The security is easily bypassed. There is NO response from Facebook/META and there is no place to contact Instagram.  Except for one USA based phoneline.   I have reported the hacked account dozens of times, reported the scam bitcoin posts. Reported it on the only form available on META/FB 'Report a bug"".  I've replied to the Google mail sent regarding the suspicious activity. I have asked others to report the account.  I HAVE HEARD NOTHING F4OM INSTAGRAM.  ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ Meanwhile my carefully gathered and nurtured contacts are being inundated with BITCOIN SPAM. Lack of Security and support has left me extremely vulnerable.  The hacker knows exactly who I communicate with via message. Has as many personal details as is on my account .  Within one minute a phone no. Apparently from Nigeria +2349085451773 took over my account,  changed the name, from PoetLoui to Poetloui55  they changed the  email and added an app to protect the NEW USER. All in under 1 minute. I received emails from Google that suspicious activity occurred on my Instagram, but all links to secure the account were useless/invalid as the account name,  everything,  was changed so quickly.  Instagram has absolutely no point of support for me to communicate with in the UK. Or anywhere. When you Google ' my Instagram account was hacked it says to change the email address  BUT THATS ALREADY BEEN DONE! The ONLY advice ANYONE had is to contact further online hackers who can retrieve your account for a cost.  WHAT A CON! AND INSTAGRAM AND FB OR Meta now, suppress all your natural traffic to your page , add shadow banning and STILL expect you to PAY for advertising and increased traffic.  DO NOT BOTHER WITH A FB/META/INSTAGRAM account unless you want to lose your intellectual property and ALL your personal details. This is a disgusting  immoral,  money grabbing exercise in your own pointless endeavours  DO NOT BOTHER. DO NOT GIVE THESE SOCIAL MEDIA CRIMINALS ANY OF YOUR DATA.

This guy had me posting on marketplace on Facebook. I lost all my friends I had moved to another city. They shut me down and still can't get in or get anyone to talk to me From Facebook. Ask them to review my account they send me stuff in Chinese where I can't even read it. All because I got a job from somebody on marketplace... Now I didn't know the rules at the time. A year later I'm trying to be an affiliate marketer.  Facebook is clear that you can sell on facebook. So on my new page I researched how to I could sale on facebook. It clearly says to join groups getting through groups. So I started joining groups and I tried to create my own group last night and they shut me out again. And I was following their rules. The problem is is the communication and not being able to speak to someone to get your side of the story. Maybe if you would just speak to someone and explain to them what is going on. Facebook is not going to be around forever because of stuff like this. I was hacked by that guy I got a job from on marketplace from Facebook.,US

Very recently I had loads of friend request about 100 or more a day plus loads of likes from these so called people before sending a friend request they also sent loads of messages on messenger as well. I was concerned even though most of my security says who sees it on Facebook only me. And know one can see my friend list only me. I was concerned for my security so I began to delete many friends who I had as friends that I did not know to well who had sent me request through friends of friends. I then had to block some of them as well. At no point did face book flag it up or ask if anything was wrong. I even let Facebook know I may have been hacked so I went through the security with them set up a new pass word and thought great Facebook has now sorted this. To my horror everything was the same loads more friend requests it seemed like friends were being added to my friends that I had not accepted why did my account say there were so many friends when I did not have the amount it stated someone must be doing something. I heard nothing more from Facebook so was worried and began to try to delete more of the friends that were added to my account without my knowledge I also delete every friend request. It was then out of the blue bang Facebook just locked my account how awful is that. All I got was a message telling me my account had been locked due to suspicious activity. Had Facebook picked up on this sooner and recognised what was happening and protected my account it would not have to have been blocked. I have sent photo of ID they requested and now I have been to told to wait for an email they will send to tell me what to do next I have been waiting 40 hours so far. I scheduled a room on the Facebook rooms for this Sunday like I do every week now what will I do. I can‚Äôt get on any of my groups or pages I have up on Facebook either it‚Äôs a nightmare.

DO NOT USE THIS SOCIAL NETWORK AND CLOSE ACCOUNTS if you already have them!,"On November 18, 2021, my Facebook account was hacked (PROBLEMS AND STRANGE ACTIONS on my account began a week after YOUR ""good"" company was seriously hacked). I hardly used Facebook (I had a premonition of insecurity ever since I knew about your existence), but the bad feeling of your company's disgusting work remains. DON'T LOOKING THAT my account had double protection: - they changed the Russian language to Chinese - changed mail - changed the login method - I did not receive a notification about the change of mail on my account - I did not receive a notification about password change - THERE WAS NO NOTIFICATIONS ON THE PHONE (to which my account was originally registered) or to the mail (which was from the very beginning of the existence of my account) - THERE WAS NOT I contacted Facebook technical support. Sent !!! 5 !!! letters with identity card. YES, there is a small nuance - I use a pseudonym EVERYWHERE. The data of the passport and account do not match when checking, BUT FACEBOOK did not bother with the fact that the card on which the account was originally registered was my real data, WHICH I SENT. ALL PHOTOS ON THE ACCOUNT ARE ALSO MY - and this does not bother anyone either. What we have: a Facebook page that hasn't had a single hacking notification, AND the scammers who are now sitting on my page with my photos and my confidential data and, INCLUDING DEBTS, are buying some advertisements. YOU ARE REAL FRUIT. WHY DO I CONNECT MY PHONE AND E-MAIL TO SOCIAL NETWORKS IF WHO CAN EASILY CHANGE THIS DATA? Russian VKontakte is harder to hack (and easier for owners to recover) than your accounts, DON'T LOOK AT THAT YOU EXIST MUCH MORE. HOW MUCH WITH YOUR FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM (one of the working pages, which I have not yet been restored). I am more and more convinced that the vast majority of American private companies are ABSOLUTELY UNPROFESSIONAL and they absolutely do not care about all the personal information that we trust you. IF YOU REQUIRE VALID DATA WHEN restoring your accounts, DO NOT ALLOW registering these accounts WITHOUT PERSONAL VERIFICATION. Would you say ""it was written in the terms of use to use real data""? YES?? Everywhere you have it is written that you have ONE OF THE BEST SECURITY SYSTEMS ... except that account holders cannot log into their account - BUT FRAUDERS GO IN AND CHANGE THE DATA - EASY. WHERE IS YOUR PROTECTION? Or requiring conditions - we can do this, AND WHEN YOU REQUIRE THE PROTECTION OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA - then immediately ""we cannot help you.

They sympathized but because facebook is controlled by lizards and AI there is no support available for customers. I can't run ads anymore, for my business which is a clothing store....

Among other educational couese on the blockchain. She had the best in the business pulling for her Ivan on Tech wrote about her. Iwan Spillebeen talked about her and followed waiting for her to launch I was going to invest my own seed money and her husband told me they couldn't take it . I ask them why ? He said this platform will never launch two and a half years ago and they started in 2017 He explained to me that the censorship of their platform and the ways things are going with the algorithms and the fact he was and activist for children that Facebook had them blocked so bad on all angles that he would never be able to out do them. The found a total of five years. 2 .5 years ago he told me everyone of the moves facebook would make . He even showed me on tor oninion where they were creating post teaching people how to groom and trafficked children and that he could not take my  money ot let me be part of that because he had kids himself he would fight them alone. I follow him and he has been kicked off reedit so many time the almost banned all of Mexico so he could join them again, He has someone come and see him and they went through all of linked in and Facebook and twitter and reedit in linked in alone on his wife account they found 110 fake accounts directly limned to Facebook . All of her friends were fake . He told me almost to the day and called the elections telling the American how rigged they were almost a year before it happen. He has a list of over 200 non profits and over 1000 trump and Biden groups all ran bye people using bots and memes to keep the weak minded he said watching the show while prepare for the biggest crimes against humanity there ever has been Bigger then the holocausts. Almost to the day he called Canada's election how it would happen.  , The same as the American elections A few days ago i found him om a blog where he posted everyone of the donations from the gates foundation to over 8000 universities in the united states to BLM to hospital and the who and cdc . UF schools that have more money then God then  he showed me the most damaging info The Proof that everyone of the media even info wars fox news and all have taken bribes from the Bill Gates foundation. I ask why would they do this ? He said the 33rd president of the United States Truman , Obama book was not about his father It was about his fathers friend and that Truman with the strongest Klan ties even outed back them with a poster that said vote Dewey kill the Klan that Obama using the mentality of a klans man wanted to do as Truman and rid the world of the one s that cost us the most money the African Americans and that is why Truman formed the CIA and the UN at the very time he did that the world changed for every. That Vietnam north nd south were fine until the CIA set tower and office in each side and instigated a war the same as they did in Benghazi and in Palestine tight now. He sent me a link to go to the Gates website the foundation and it is all on their, everyone of the bribes and it is global. Then what he did next has had me sick to my stomach all day. 2017 to 2018 he said google how many people were on earth he said be fair and start 3 to 4 years earlier and then go 3 years ahead so I did They alway had a rise of 3.2 to 3.9 million per here minus the death still the world grew about 1.6% in 2017 the population was i thing 7.6 million then i went to 2018 7.592 mil so he check a few other site and you can see it looked a little better but not the .3.9 mill missing that that this only happened one other time in prehistory the holocausts. He had screen shots and time stamps because google would go and change it the second it came out. so he posted to a site and then we copied it and posted it   and then Facebook kicked us both You see the got kicked for offering a platform that would teach the children how to protect themselves from online stalkers by code-sourcing and see who viewed your profile and his software called th troll alert would warn the parents and admin of the stalker and they could reach out to admin who would check the stalker and trace him to see if it was a danger or just some weird bypassing.

So Nicola Sturgeon can have her woeful Covid management erased by the likes of influential moderators on one of the worlds biggest platforms and Zucker keeps good with a government who will no doubt reward him and his vile minions before selling off the country to the EU.  Facebook is a cancer on free speech , not a safe place for anyone who engages with it's content and full of tolerated scammers. Maybe we need to think back to how Zuck set up Facebook wasn't it trolling and hacking into Harvards systems that set the spark in motion ?? yet in no time this self serving , anti establishment figure has gone from a progressive to an establishment lackey.

I am an artist. over the years they have become more and more of an obstacle. In the beginning, I create embattled archetypes that represents issues facing us today and comment on the human condition.  I did a series of masked women in lingerie and military uniforms. I write alot about why I do the type of art I do.  They gave me a hard time about this. These paintings were done in Oaxaca and got into the Cervantino art Festival, the most prestigous art festival in Mexico by famous curators and shown at the Museo de Alhondigas in Guanajuato. I put up ads and they refuse them and have taken my money on some occassions. I have complained. They don't return my money. They have become an obstacle in my ability to make money and be seen. I live in a small town, so it matters that I have internet presence and its what helps drive traffic for sales and my survival.   They are unsupportive of the small business and especially artists. I know alot of artists that are leaving facebook because of constant censorship. I have followed their guidelines and they still censor me. Now I can't log in on my computer if I restart my computer. Even though I have the correct email and password. Now I have to have it texted to my phone and because my phone wasn't working I have to go thru a process to identifying myself, which I did in which they told me it could take up to 48 hours and still nothing. I do make sales on facebook, I get messages and when I am unable to answer right away I loose sales. Therefore, if you are an artist who does cute animals and flowers, you will do good on facebook, because they only know commercial art, but not the that type of art that has meaning.  But if you do art that is edgy, has meaning, comments on the human condition and inspires people you will be censored. I am leaving facebook. I will go to instagram and google. That is the advice I am giving to any artist that has any imagination and likes edgy topics. The big tech places like facebook don't want you!

Shame on Zuckerberg for doing this. Also they limit your profile finding so no one sees or find you, even what you post or comment, same thing they will do to your business page, want to be found pay huge money for ads. My advice go create your own website and remove any social Icons and stop worshipingh this ocult company.

We are only a number, they don't care what happens to us.","I've had my Facebook account for 14 years and until this past year I've never had my account restricted as I don't ever post anything that violates the community standards on the app. I recieved my first restriction this year, which was a misunderstanding and taken out of context, I disputed and even though Facebook agreed with my dispute.. my account remained restricted for 2 weeks and I had a mark against my account. This continued to happen with posts that were completely normal and I'm struggling to understand how they are being flagged for misconduct. After a recent 30 day restriction, I was only unrestricted for less then 24 hours when my account was restricted again for a post that was just me writing a cocktail recipe. There was a swear word in the post (for a joke) but I was still banned again for ""bullying and harassment"". I wouldn't be so bothered that I no longer have the ability to use my account, if I hadn't just spent an entire year completely isolated because of covid. I feel so lonely and disconnected from the world that I've become depressed and I'm struggling deeply with some dark thoughts because of it. My support groups are also on Facebook, which of course I don't have access too. I can't interact with events or posts about gatherings at all and for absolutely no reason Facebook has further isolated me and forced me to be completely alone. I don't have other forms of social media. I also have a new phone number that nobody knows yet. I'm struggling with some social anxiety, so using messenger to contact each person individually isn't something I can do. I tried reporting the issue to Facebook which did nothing. When I tried to make a report again.. I was given a notification saying that the report option was turned off for my account. I can't make a new facebook because it recognizes my ip address and the new account is immediately restricted as well. I have mental health issues and physical health issues that make getting myself out into the world a bit difficult. This is careless and disrespectful on facebooks part. I feel like I've lost the ability to contact anyone and when I think about the fact that (for at least) the next 30 days I won't have the ability to speak to another person... its almost hard to breath. And even after that.. I feel like I'll just br immediately restricted again because it keeps happening. This might not seem like a big deal to a normal person who doesn't have some of the hurdles and issues that others do... but to people like me? This is basically a death sentence. I don't know what to do if I'm not allowed to talk to anyone at all anymore. I can't keep doing this. I just want to give up, what's the point if I'm completely alone.",CA

I listed this scammer (Karen May) on Marketplace as a scammer and started receiving messages from scammed buyers by the same fraudster thief seller, AND GOD KNOWS HOW MANY MORE BUYERS MONEY HE HAS STOLED BEFORE AND WIL STEEL LATER, BECAUSE HERE IS NO OPTION TO REPORT IT OR CLOSE ITS ACCOUNT! WELL DONE, FACEBOOK! YOU HAVE OPENED ALL GATES FOR THE CRIMINALS! But Facebook does not care and of course, WE NEVER EVER BUY ANYTHING AGAIN ON FACEBOOK MARKETPLACE, IT'S JUST A SCAM! ======================== UPDATE. Just received from Facebook reply to my report on Karen May: ''Today at 14:08 We didn't remove Karen May's profile Handyman, our technology reviewed your report against our Community Standards. Ultimately, we decided not to take the profile down. We take action on profiles that pose a danger to other people or are harmful to the community. If there's something specific on this profile that you think we should review (e.g. a photo), please report the content itself. Thanks again for helping us keep Facebook safe and welcoming for everyone'' So, as I said above, Facebook does not care! Content on Karen May Marketplace ended or seller removed, and I cannot give it to Facebook, who must see all previous listings by them self (of course if they want to see it!) MESSAGES FROM MORE SCAMMED BUYERS by the same seller: ''STEVE. Looks like she's had me too mate.'' ''FIONA. Yes, she got me too. I contacted PayPal but because I paid her via friends and family (didn't know what that meant!) They refuse to refund my money. Up until yesterday (24.07.2021) she/they still had ads on Facebook.  I notified them and my bank and still can't get a refund, infuriating because  someone knows which account my money was paid to'' MORE WILL FOLLOW... until Facebook will close Karen May and similar scammers and takes a proper care of Marketplace business. ... or maybe Facebook just will close my Facebook account, to shut me up! Will see. At the moment Im reporting this Online to Cyber Fraud Police. UPDATE 02.08.2021 Nearly a Month passed since I purchased Vase from the scammer Karen May / Parker / Jones on the facebook. PayPal refused to issue refund and facebook deleted my Listing from the Marketplace regarding Scammer but the funniest thing: SCAMMER STILL SELLING ON MARKETPLACE ON THE SAME KAREN MAY ACCOUNT!? I received many emails from cheated buyers, but Karen still stealing buyers money, and facebook dont move a finger! So today I opened case against PayPal on Resolver website, and it went to Financial Ombudsman. Next, more serious steps I will take against facebook until Karen may will be gone or jailed.

The other day i went and created a new ad for an upcoming event i had coming up. I published the ad and it went into review. The next thing i knew, i had a message telling me my ad account was disabled and i was banned from running ads. I got no feedback, no reasons and they even disabled my other ads which were already approved and running for years. I sent an appeal as i had no idea what I had done wrong, i then got a message straight away saying they have enabled my account, but yet again no reasons, feedback as to what i did wrong. I was too scared to turn my new ad on, in fear of being disabled again, so i sent another message asking them what i did wrong? So i could prevent this from happening again...this is the message i received in return: "" I've had another look at your ad account and unfortunately, we won't be able to re-enable it. There's no further action that you may take here. Please consider this decision as final "" What is wrong with these people? It makes no sense. I went back into my ad account and thankfully its still enabled and its not been disabled despite the message i received. As a regular monthly advertiser who invests money in facebook, I have been left stressed, confused, scared with no idea what is going on. And I'm too scared to even run another ad again in the fear i may get disabled. I have no reasons, no feedback, no idea what the problem was in the first place.

Technical abnormalities are forcing me off the platform because someone else has control of my account. Facebook options to correct this problem do not work and I am forced to self-delete my account. When Facebook uses the term community standards the specter of oxymoronic logic blocks out the light of reality.     The weirdness started with my being accused by their censors of not meeting Facebook community standards. If posting factual quotes by Rush Limbaugh and Donald Trump are breaking their community standards how are people supposed to remember what they've said and done. (Is this a ""huge coverup?"")     Another time I was suspended for Covid miss information. That's simply not true. I have had both the vaccine doses and I have supported masks and social distancing before they were even implemented by any agency. I never have figured out what they were talking about.    NOW I HAVE HUNDREDS OF POSTS ON MY ACTIVITY LOG THAT I DIDN'T CREATE. I changed the password several times and followed the processes the website provided but the fake posts kept happening. 91 fake posts showed up over a 24 hour period while my account was deactivated.    Multiple requests for attention and help have been ignored. I have been clear in my communications, repeating multiple times, that I do not feel safe when someone else is posting on my timeline. I have no idea what they're saying under my name.    The problem here is not that things happen, but that they refuse to recieve information about or correct the problem. Their corporate phone and website solutions lead nowhere. Phone prompts eventually lead you to someone who tells you that they're not helping anyone over the phone. The website processes do not solve the problem and only lead you back to do them again.     I have lodged a complaint with the BBB. I don't expect much from this because they have a record of just ignoring complaints. THAT SUGGESTS TO ME A DEEP LEVEL OF CONTEMPT FOR THEIR CLIENTS.   So, my account is being self-deleted, and I have been silenced. Good job Mark Zuckerberg. You managed to shut down a voice that has tried to keep some truth at the center of the viewfinder.",US

When I was given the choise by Trustpilot to write something down without given fb a star I would. In fact, fb get no stars from me. If people post something that is true and even proven to be true, fb takes it off telling that the post is fake news and a danger to the world. Fb is trying more and more to hide true things and when some one posts something that fb does not like to be shown then they punnish the person who posted something for a minimum of 30 days in fb prison. 30 Days restricted by Fb, without the opportunity to give a reaction to them about their action. Even if it is a broadcast from a local news organization fb has the guts to take it off writing that they broadcasted fake news. So, something is very wrong with that Mark Zuckerberg and something is definitly wrong with all those checkers he hired. And even when people put a red heart on their time line with the text: I have a heart fom freedom, fb blocks it and takes it of. So if Trustpilot gives me the opportunety to give fb zero stars then I would give fb zero stars, which means that fb does not earn a star at all. You have to earn a star showing good behaviour and fb does only show bad behaviour. Some people have the thought that fb looks more and more like a criminal organization and I agree with that. I even think that Trustpilot gives a wrong impression to the world. Why? Because we have to give Fb at least one star, even if we don't want to give them a star. So to Trustpilot I like it better when I have the opportunity to choose my self weather I give a star or not to a company, because now Trustpilot forces me to give Fb one star and I don't want to because one star for Fb is on star to many.  And Trustpilot gives the choices to show my writing to fb, but that is not such a good idea. What you think fb does when some one gives them a bad review? Then this person goes to fb jail immediatly.

What Community Standard was not followed when it is a new account request and has never been used?  2.  Why is it not reverseable when I have done nothing other than try to change to a different email address?  3.

(Over ten years)  In recent times I've come to realise Facebook does not have any care for scammers and scamming posts (the ones that pays hundreds for you to do 2 hours of work but only want you bank details ). Unfortunately many people fall for these scams and yet Facebook does not care .  If you report these freshly made profiles that are used solely for scams they will not be taken down!  Because appare tly scamming isn't against community guidelines,  but however on the other hand if you have the audacity to tell these scammers where to stick there scams you will be temporarily banned from posting (much like I have Ben placed on a 24 hour posting ban ).  However within less than 1 hour of this posting ban my account has been suspended and I just request a review within 28days or the account will be permanently suspended .  At this point I am unsure why the suspension has been placed on my account . Weather it is relatively related to the posting ban or not I am unsure, but I cannot request a review because apparently one has already been requested to which I do not understand how as I did not request one .  I have attempted to contact Facebook via twitter and direct contact but they will not answer .  After looking into this more with the like of Google, reddit , twitter and other sources this Facebook suspension it becoming a very common thing and from most people's they also do not understand why and state that they have no previous trouble with Facebook.. In conclusion you can do nothing or little wrong and get instant suspension but if you're making new accounts or hacking established accounts to scam people out there hard earned money then that's OK because most of these scammers will have multiple accounts and will always keep creating or stealing more and keeping Facebook numbers up .",GB

From what I can see, it takes zero pride in the quality of its performance as shown by its new layout (trash) for which there was a workaround offered by a third party but they managed to screw that up as well. Also, Facebook is well known for restricting people's accounts with little explanation, perhaps based on the likes or dislikes of employees who lack the maturity necessary to go with authority, while tolerating (until a widespread public outcry forced Facebook to disable the account) a page called ""Jewish Ritual Murder."" If Trustpilot allowed upload of screenshots, I have one of FB telling me that ""Jewish Ritual Murder"" did not violate what it calls its community standards. I also reported some pages for 9/11 conspiracy theories including one with Israel's Prime Minister pointing to the Twin Towers and the caption, ""Mossad put explosives here."" I just checked it (Oct. 12 2021) and it is still there so maybe the same moderators who are telling people, with little explanation, that their posts violate community standards and/or their accounts are restricted, approve this kind of material. While I do not agree with a lot of what Donald Trump says, by the way, it interesting that Facebook banned him but does not ban 9/11 conspiracy theories and (until a public outcry forced it to remove the page) ""Jewish Ritual Murder."" UPDATE (November 2022): Facebook also permits glorification of terrorists like Rasmea Odeh (who murdered two Jews with a bomb) and Assata Shakur (on the FBI's Most Wanted List for murder of a police officer) and also allows Ayatollah Khamenei to spew his propaganda on Facebook.

If they see you use one word ( and it doesn't matter the context ) you are instantly banned. They offer you an appeal, and the very same computer that banned you in the first place, scans the words again, see's the same word and comes back saying ""we've checked and your appeal is denied"" Try getting hold of support.. No chance. There isn't a support centre. They ban you from asking questions on the help section too. Now this is how stupid they are. A friend of mine sang the Fairytale of New York via a live feed.

Facebook used to be a good place to stay connected to friends and family and even more so during these very difficult times where people aren‚Äôt seeing the ones they love. Then blocking people off even more from their support network is disgusting.  You wonder why suicide rates are so high it‚Äôs just beyond belief. I‚Äôve reported so many fake accounts and people for blatantly bullying someone yet I get a reply saying they haven‚Äôt broken Facebook terms and conditions??? Now I feel it‚Äôs time after so many years to walk away from this site, money pouring into the fat cats hands yet they have zero thought for the people who actually use the site.  I can see why so many are leaving FB it‚Äôs not at all how it once was sadly and reading these reviews with no replies just highlights what I‚Äôm saying. Speaks volumes.",GB

2965,www.facebook.com,2021-02-08T05:37:53.000Z,1,Scammers connected to Facebook steal money,"On January 23, 2021, I wrote a review about losing access to my Facebook account and the impossibility of contacting Facebook.  Well, since then it has gotten much worse.  I found a phone number for Facebook(supposedly). It turned out to be a number connecting me to scammers.  In my na√Øvet√© and desperation to access my Facebook account, I went along with these lying, thieving people who prey on folks like me.  I spoke with Stella, a very polished, convincing woman who assured me she would get me back on my account. She asked me to go to Safeway or a comparable store and get gift cards to stop the hackers: she said there were five in  Canada, Mexico and three U.S. states. I did it; sat in the parking lot, opened the cards and gave her the numbers.  Of course she assured me the money would be returned. Then she sent me on to ""security"" and this man asked the same thing which involved buying more cards and giving him the access codes, etc. He assured me i would be covered for life from any hacking and could recover my account. The next morning, early, another guy called and said pro Russian hackers had gotten hold of all my informstion and he wanted another trip to a major store for gift cards.  Fortunately, I told my daughter and son-in-law about this and they were skeptical.  Nevertheless, having ben caught up in the frenzy, I went down the hill once more and bought five cards.  While i was once again ordered to stay in the parking lot and scratch off the access codes, my daughter called and told me to come home immediately.  I did head home without contacting the bad man who was calling insistently. My family had done some research and found that this gift card scam was a thing. Fortunately, I did not give this third caller the card info so he could not get the money. The criminals called and called from different numbers, undoubtedly burner phones. We told them off in no uncertain terms; nevertheless they kept calling that night. So, I lost some money and learned an important lesson. I feel foolish; however, they are very convincing and exhaust the victim who so desperately wants Facebook access to far-flung friends. Facebook bears some responsibility here and should be aware of the scam and take steps to stop it. By making it impossible for an innocent Facebook user to access her hacked account, Facebook is opening up the door to hackers. Because Facebook always seems to be changing options, I was not aware of the choice to have a trusted friend on my account so I could log back in after being hacked.  It makes me sad that Facebook, which does provide an important service, is so poorly run.",US

In the middle of my ad going out, the ad was shut down claiming that I was 'selling alcohol to minors'. This was absolute garbage, I wasn't nor suggested it. I contacted them, they said to get my account reviewed and it would be a 48 turn around in which I had to provide my passport as evidence of authenticity. It wasn't 48 hours turn around and because of my ad being pulled down my quiz night didn't get enough people and we didn't raise enough money. The customer care person told me that it was a technical error because of a high level of fraudulent and criminal activity on fb.  I published a book and needed to share it on an ad, but 2 months later fb was still reviewing my account and it caused a huge dent in my business. 3 months later they come back to me banning me completely from the ad centre. This sickened me. 5 years of honest hard work, building my professional profile on Facebook, using FB instead of other sites, money spent on them and they lock me out of the one way I could promote myself. I have seen too many fraudulent ads and posts and even pages on FB, they don't ban them, no, they ban me! Their support is actually disgusting, noone answers to enquiries in the customeg  support section and when I spoke to them in the chat about my little issue they were patronising, scripted and useless.

It all happened when she posted an ad about a product on her own timeline (with privacy set only for her to see) so she would have that product saved for later purchase. Facebook understood and reported this as a spam activity and restricted her account. It started by not allowing her to post, like or comment on any post, followed by a complete restriction (inability to access the account; when logging in, Facebook states that the account is temporarily unavailable, and that‚Äôs how it is until today, more than one month already). After the first few days after this happened, we believed that there was another problem with the account, for we just couldn‚Äôt believe that this was only because of the alleged ‚Äúspam activity‚Äù. And so, we tried to recover the account using Facebook‚Äôs procedure, by getting codes from three trusted contacts (she didn‚Äôt have access to the phone number on the account anymore, neither the account was allowing her to recover the account by her e-mail). After getting those codes, my wife was taken to a page where she could change her password, but after doing that, the next login didn‚Äôt recognize the new password that was just changed... so we understood even less... Couple of days later, we tried another recovery process, on which we stated that my wife couldn‚Äôt have access to her account anymore and a link to the profile in question was sent, along with my wife‚Äôs ID to prove she was the account‚Äôs owner. The instructions were to wait for Facebook to reply, which never happened. Couple of weeks later, we tried the three trusted contacts recovery process once again. This time, after getting the three codes again, my wife was shown a web page requesting a phone number where she would get a new code for the recovery. She entered her phone number, received the code and upon entering this code, Facebook created a new account for her (instead of recovering the account she wanted). Now, if she wanted to create a new account, she wouldn‚Äôt need to go to the trouble of getting codes from contacts, she could have done that without it, and she wanted to recover her old account because  she has many things saved on that account that would be lost with a new one. This situation affected her Instagram account as well, probably because both accounts are connected. She can view and comment on posts on Instagram and send direct messages, but she can‚Äôt post anything on her timeline or her stories. By the way, even though my wife‚Äôs account is set as temporarily unavailable, she still receives push notifications on her phone about activities on Facebook from her contacts... but whenever following the notifications, she gets stuck on the ""account unavailable screen"", I mean, how messed up is this? We think that this situation, understanding that it as a result of a ‚Äúspam activity‚Äù, is a complete nonsense, even because saving a post of a product to oneself with the privacy set for only him or her to see, is not a spam activity at all. We have completely exhausted all ways of trying to recover my wife‚Äôs account with no success, getting instead strange and inexplicable results. Now she's facing the fact that she might lose everything she had on this account because there's nothing that can be done.",BR

I was banned from posting for 30 days this last time , because I shared a picture from my phone of the Trump rally and a video of Biden supporters spitting in kids , facebook sends me a notice that I violated there community standards for social caste and bullying , although I'm not sure how that is either one of those things. This isn't the first time either , I've been banned from posting for calling a guy stupid after he was telling me that he was going to shoot me, I actually was banned for bullying and harassment and he told me that he was going to kill me lol not the other way around. I share a meme that was shared to me , I get banned for 12 days for Spamming  , I share a story about President Trump ,it's removed immediately . It's like if it's pro Trump it's automatically bad and removed ,if it's pro BLM or pro antifa or Pro Biden it's perfectly fine. I'm so sick of dealing with Facebook and the fact checkers that I've deleted facebook and messenger and instagram from my phone permanently now .  That's another thing ,they have Fact checkers who are adding nonsense at the bottom of everything, I posted a picture of my kids opening presents and I get a warning from the Facebook fact checkers stating that it's not a real picture and there research shows that it's political in nature , because in the background on the tv there was a picture of President Trump lol. You just can't make this crap up anymore with Facebook , it was was just a non-stop nightmare using it.  It's either fight with Facebook everyday ,read bogus fake news stories and leave facebook feeling upset ,or just delete it for good . So that's what I did, I Deleted my Facebook account and everything else that crooked place owns and joined mewe . In my opinion it's been a godsend joining the mewe platform and leaving facebook in the dust . Since joining mewe ,I don't have any issues with what I post or who I follow politically ,I don't get fb jail and I noticed that I'm never fighting with anyone from any political party which is amazing. Mewe checks off all my lists of what a social app should be. The direct opposite of what facebook is, facebook was like being stuck in a loop of adds , being told what to do, and what I could or couldn't believe in , constantly listening to fighting and more Racism than anything , and from what I noticed, the Racists weren't on the republican side of the comments it was 98% democratic supporters that pushed this crap along. It was like a constant fight to be on Facebook. And I have to say that on Facebook I never seen so many Democrats troll republican groups,it was like they had to be in every group spreading there nonsense and if you replied back facebook would ban you for replying ,as if I was wrong no matter what and the democrats basically could do whatever they wanted without fear of being banned for anything. But that's why I left and have no intention on ever joining facebook again. It's like they want to be in charge of everything and everyone, reminded me of Nazi germany and I don't want anything to do with that.

We was told to hold on to the dog until his rightful owner could be found which was quite worrying as we didn't have room for a dog, but did only wanted to help the dog by reuniting him with his owners. But obviously as we'd been told by witnesses that he was abandoned we had little hope of that happening. Three days past and nothing, then a man came to our door claiming he was the owner, we were absolutely extatic as finally the dog could go home, the man didn't seem interested in how we found the dog, and just seemed eager to go, but as nobody had been in touch we ask the man how he knew we was taking care of his dog? The man replied with, 'you're both all over social media! And he left. Obviously we checked on the internet and found out that the police had put a missing dog report in the local newspaper as of three hours from the time the man came, which we called right away to happily tell them that man and dog had been reunited, to which the police man simply took note of and thanked me. We continued our internet search for whatever this man was speaking of and then to our horror we saw that he'd actually not being content with the help from the police, this man had found a cctv image of my mum and myself carrying this poor animal home and used it to track us down, by asking people who we were and having them make vile comments about us by insinuating that we'd actually stolen this poor elderly animal, and to make it worse he actually administered posters with our images on all in our local area as well as Facebook. So thanks to Facebook a nasty little man got the chance to trash us in public and even when the dog was returned he never even acknowledged publicly the fact that we'd saved his dog from the road, took care of him and returned his dog to him safely. The stress and unhappiness this man caused us was all because he had Facebook as his weapon to simply hurt the only two people who cared about helping his dog and returning him home. I believe that people who have done nothing wrong do not deserve to be victimised by a social media platform by people who don't know them whether they are actually a member or not a member of it, and my heart goes out to anyone who have been harassed in any way by Facebook and the nasty people who monger hatred on it. Thank you.",GB

Mark Zuckerberg behaves as if he is above the law.  The fact that he is being sued by both Germany and USA for the same thing is not ironic.  He cheats. Period. He squeezes the little man and then sucks the life blood out of him. IN ADDITION. There is NO PLACE to talk to a person. The very rules they shove down our throats, they themselves do not follow.  My daughter has been beaten up repeatedly due to fake accounts created about her father and myself for 11 YEARS NOW. AND STILL GOING ON. ...that I have literally spent over 150 hours reporting. I get the same regurgitated messages back telling me they can do nothing about it. It is a catch 22 when you report as well.  To report someone, you have to report their page. If you are blocked because they dont want you there since they are creating fake pages in your name, you cannot go, and if you report the fake page, IT IS IN YOUR NAME. SO IT GOES IN CIRCLES. They are ZERO HELP. My daughter is young and has been beaten so many time we had to move...more than once because FB ALLOWS LIARS TO MAKE FAKE PAGES IN YOUR NAME. My husband has been in the hospital after being attacked because of a dare, or ""challenge"" purposed by these same people ON FACEBOOK. Then they quickly delete the account so they aren't caught...not that FB would do anything about it.  If you crack a joke about they fact that theyre criminals though, you get banned. How about the ""fact checking?"" NO ONE IS FACT CHECKING THE MULTIPLE FAKE PAGES IN OUR NAMES, THOUGH.  The guys are in jail doing 4+ years for this crime....but FB wont answer. Theyre too busy apparently harassing the Oculus people and screwing the creator out of his retirement. Mark Zuckerberg is a horrible person who obviously believe money is everything.  His mother should be humiliated by his complete lack of morals.  I hope Congress  makes him pay for his evil, too.

It is kinda funny when an individual can literally attract you with Transphobic memes and you retaliate after numerous attempts to report said memes that were deemed by Facebook as a non-violation of their Community Standards yet you call out the individual in retaliation and you violated the Standards for Harassing and Bullying. Facebook's Oversight Committee refuses to review anything brought to them by anyone and seems to of been created for the purpose of making Facebook look like they are attempting to compensate for the numerous violations of United States Constitutional Rights that Zuckerberg went in front of Congress over earlier last month. Facebook is a completely and ridiculous platform that don't care about the First Ammendment Right of its United States Citizens or the rights of its users from around the world. Facebook is a platform ran by Liberal Snowflakes who were once bullied and now gets to bully back by picking and choosing which person doesn't meet their standards like Trump Supporters, Transwomen/Transmen, or any member of the LGBTQ Community for that matter yet those who commit Harassing and Bullying tactics onto them are not in violation for Harassment and Bullying or even for Hate Speech.",US

Stay safe, all they are doing is to steal money after having your PayPal account. My story: 09:35 I've seen an add on Facebook for a free Financial trial for 14 days with Shaw Academy. I've entered, I've signed up and then I've entered my PayPal details for the trial. 09:39 I was charged by Shaw Academy( without receiving any notification from them, bank or PayPal)  09:44 I've received the welcome email from Shaw Academy. 09:53 I've called Shaw Academy to cancel the trial because the time of the courses was not suited for my schedule ( the only way to cancel is by phone). 09:59 after I've spoken with a Shaw Academy representant and I've asked numerous times to cancel the subscription, created 15 minutes before then when we finished the phone call I've received an email saying that I received a free toolkit and 15 more days of a free trial. After 3 days, by coincidence, I've used PayPal to do some transactions and I noticed Shaw Academy charged me 49.99¬£. I thought it was just an erroneous  payment and then I've checked my banking where the payment was also taken. I've emailed Shaw Academy and they said that I've bought a Tool kit, which was not true. I haven‚Äôt bought nothing; it is almost impossible to join a free trial with the intention to buy a toolkit after 2 minutes. What toolkit anyone would need to start a financial course which is free. Everything is a big lie meant for them to steal money. I told them everything as I mentioned before, and they refused to refund me. I started a dispute through PayPal which was closed after a couple of hours saying that was nothing wrong with the transaction and I won't get my money back. I've called my bank who said that I need 15 days to start a different type of claim but probably won't help. The only thing left is to let you all know what they did and how they stole my 49.99¬£ and from now on I will share this information everywhere and probably I will try legal advice and if possible sue them. This is happening for years based on people reviews and nobody does nothing to stop this scam. Shame to everyone involved : Shaw Academy for being the biggest scammer that I ever meet in my life. PayPal for not offering protection against fraudulent payments despite they argue this, and they dealt in the past with hundreds/thousands of complaints regarding Shaw Academy. Facebook for promoting such kind of company and everyone else who think that normal people like myself are good only to be scammed and treated like garbage. Hope that you will see this review and be more careful in the future, don't use your personal details on every shady site and don't trust PayPal to protect you against scammers.",GB

To my surprise, the support department has no ability to view the basis for the decision nor can they provide any information as to why the account is disabled. I am told several times here that the decision is final and basically, accept it!  I am advised to set up another page (as if the loss of page likes and reviews will not bear any negative impact on my business!) and start from scratch.  How can one even consider doing that if even when Facebook makes an error, you still suffer as a direct result of that error?

BEWARE THIS IS A SCAM!!!  They will provide a personal direct line: 650-263-7738. When questioned they say they are employee ID: FB97128360131P and ext #10024. What a bunch of crap! Do not give them personal information and protect your ID. I gave more information than I should have which I would not have prior if they had wanted the credit card purchase prior. They state they can remove the hackers but only after your purchase the card and provide them numbers. BULL! Does Facebook not watch for scammers in their own customer service numbers??? OMG!  Facebook can't provide IP protection only this google card from the store can??? HAHA....BEWARE CALLING THIS NUMBER. They cannot help you and cannot access your account!!! But they will try to manipulate you saying they can remove 15 hackers but can not remove the last 5 without the credit card.,US

I have been trying to reach out regularly, and I filled out everything they have required and I've yet to hear anything. I am still locked out of my account, and therefore also all my business pages. Facebook doesn't care at all. They hide behind the fact that they don't actually have any kind of customer service team and just send you through automated responses which don't help you at all. They even throw in the comment that they may or may not get back to you if they need more info, so you have no idea where the status of your problem resolvement is. I hate how integrated Facebook has become that you need to use it in your day to day online business. I love when they send out surveys to see how you perceive them as caring for their users, let me tell you I've never filled it out incorrectly as they obviously don't care about their users at all. Five days and counting Facebook I want this issue resolved immediately.",CA

Indl√¶gget, der i √∏vrigt var holdt i et p√¶nt sprog, blev slettet umiddelbart efter offentligg√∏relsen, og derefter blev min konto lukket. Mark Zuckerberg er blevet beskrevet som lidt af en Trump-lover, hvilket kan v√¶re sv√¶rt at forst√•, med alt der k√∏rer for ham.

De fodrede Trump med stemmer nok i 2016, selvom den demokratiske fl√∏j havde den socialdemokrat-lignende Bernie Sanders, som ville have v√¶ret det naturlige valg for dem. Nu tabte Sanders jo s√• til Hillary Clinton om at blive demokraternes pr√¶sident-kandidat, og var derfor noget vanskelig at f√• valgt frem for Trump ved selve pr√¶sidentvalget. Og s√• var der kun 'bordel-mutter' Hillary, som mange jo meget ejendommeligt troede p√•, at hun var, at stemme p√•. Jeg ved ikke, om det virkelig kan t√¶nkes at aktiemajoritet Zuckerberg har udstedt ordre om at fjerne trusler mod hans ven Trumps pr√¶sidentskaberi, men jeg r√∏g da ud af butikken ret s√• √∏jeblikkeligt efter offentligg√∏relsen.

H√•ber hun kan g√∏re et bedre job end i sin tid i t√•rnet. √Öh, nej, det ser vist skidt ud. Indl√¶gget var jo noget pjat, men et absolut stuerent fors√∏g p√• lidt holdningsp√•virkning.

For one thing we would be without a President Donald Trump, that's for sure!‚Äù ‚ÄúOh my God, what a terrible thought, don't you think. Thank God for that great and wonderful base. Everybody all over the western hemisphere has called this beautiful base ‚Äúdumb‚Äú, but how can they be, when they have enriched the world, this wonderful Planet, oh, it's getting hotter and hotter here, with this not only wonderful, but also beautiful president.‚Äù ‚ÄúPresident Donald Trump!

I paid for two campaigns for two different non-commercial FB pages I have. One brought me over 100 page likes and the other about 70. Both pages are promoting my two YouTube channels and unfortunately my YT channels' traffic hasn't improved a great deal, maybe just a few views out of all the FB likes. No gain at all. Another problem is the FB reach, my posts have not been shown to all the people who liked my pages. And after stopping the ads, the organic reach dropped even more. A post from last week reached only 40% of my followers. Another post from yesterday reached only 15% of them. And guess what, when I publish the same post from my personal account, there's no reach either, almost nothing comparing to the time before buying their ads. Apparently I paid for making my situation worse than before. I regret I spent money on FB ads, it's just not worth it at all. A total waste of money. The only thing I get in massive proportions is FB intrusive ads trying to make me buy their ads again... And I'm not a business, I don't have funds for advertisement.

I come and go. I actually really enjoy it but too much! That's the problem. It starts to become an overwhelming place to be after a while mostly because of all the messages I get, if you have ADHD you often ignore messages or mean to look at them later and then forget. This is what happens and then I feel guilty because I am seemingly ignoring people and I end up feeling bad about myself and I leave.  This is the important point I would like to make... Facebook gives the option to not have people comment on your posts. I would like Facebook to give the option of not being available for contact via messages. (I don't use the messenger app, I go to desktop view to see my messages) I don't want anyone to send me personal messages on Facebook because actually 90% of them are nonsense.

I recently made an account with them in order to use it to promote a Youtube channel I run through a different email than this one. Thought it would be a good way to get in contact with fans of the channel and interact with them. No more than twelve hours after I made it, Facebook locked my account, claiming I'm impersonating someone 'famous', and is demanding I go through their frankly suspicious security procedures to unlock my account again. An 'I am not a robot' captcha? Fine. That's simple enough, pretty common too.  A code they send to your phone? A little strange but okay, I guess.  A clear photo of myself without obstructions and good lighting? Sounds like facial recognition to me, which I didn't sign up for.  A photo of a current identification card? No. Absolutely not. That's incredibly suspicious and I will not be slotted into some database for them to find me if I put one toe out of line. I'm pretty sure that's illegal too, but I don't know enough about the laws surrounding that to contest it just yet. I decided to partially fudge my photo of myself, but stopped and never sent in a photo of my ID, because that's dangerous. They claim it's to 'check to make sure you're using a real name', which is BS, because all forms of ID they ask for have home addresses and other sensitive information on them. They claim to delete them after you send them in, but you can almost guarantee they don't. What were they going to ask for next? My social security number? My bank accounts? A credit card? How deep does THAT rabbit hole go, I wonder. Whatever happened to anonymity and the ability to connect? Why are you holding my accounts hostage under pretense of making sure 'I'm a real person'? Combined with other complaints of being a platform where being a decent human being apparently gets you banned, I'm never trusting them with anything truly personal, and I would highly suggest you find a different platform to keep in touch with friends and family. If I could give 0 stars for this abhorrent behaviour, I would. They should be ashamed of this.",US

My problem is,when not local,the buyer needs to trust the seller to post the item once paid for. Usually okay,on this occasion,once I had paid,directly into the sellers bank account,all contact from the seller ceased. We are not talking a large sum here,but I have attempted to pursue the matter. My bank,who have all details of the sellers account,claim they will attempt to retrieve the sum,but so far no result.My bank also suggested I inform the police,which I have done,but again no news. Now,the reason for this review. On Facebook Marketplace,there is the option of reporting an item,or the seller. This I have done,indicating a possible scam. As this was a few weeks ago,it would appear Facebook make no attempt to update the complainee,or indeed do anything at all to protect or inform the buyer. Unlike the likes of Ebay,Facebook offer no protection for sellers,but surely,when a scam is reported,they can at least take steps,to prevent the scammer,from further trading,or do they simply turn a blind eye to scammers?",GB

Things were working relatively fine until a couple of months ago. Now, simple functions, like editing page roles and connecting our brand's Instagram account have become impossible. I have been emailing Facebook's support team for nearly three weeks now. I have identified the issues I am having, included screenshots, and even suggested solutions. However, their team merely refers me to another department, or another employee, everytime I write back to their emails. When they do provide solutions, they do not fix the issues i am having. Broken links, error messages, outdated support instructions - these things have all wasted hours of my life, and hours of my organization's time. After the privacy issues, the data collection, the lack of content oversight - Why does anyone still support this company? There is no reason why Facebook or it's subsidiaries should be considered on par with other tech giants like Google and Microsoft. Get it together Facebook.",US

There is nothing to stop somebody writing harassing or abusive text on your timeline if they are on your friends list. There is no way to report this instance and the help and support is not adequate because it is all in text and you cannot speak to anybody in customer service, you can post a question to the community but there is no direct line for something that seems to be everywhere. If you then go onto the persons profile to try and report them. There is a minimal list of multiple choice reasons which you cannot add information to as evidence or at all.    I do continue to use the website and app that it offers but I see no moderation for inappropriate abusive and potentially harmful content. I give it 1 star because of how long it has been almost a part of lifestyle now, how much money it has made and I cant seem to understand why it would show such minimal care for its users. It even has a film made after it and still seems to be stuck in the past and unnmoderated. Even my Xbox system has a report button for abusive messages.

It has constant issues loading, keeping track of things I've posted and in solving issues I've had. In the last year I had my account on there hacked, I contacted them instantly in hopes of getting in back and waited for them to reply after giving them EVERYTHING they asked for. But no reply, I kept checking and over 6 months later and still no fuckingg reply. I have now checked and the person who STOLE my account has now deleted my email from it and fully taken all ability of me ever getting my thousands of pictures to do with my daughter, my photography etc back. I have now forever lost them just as I had been starting to back them up. So thank you facebook for proving you are the biggest mess up of a website with the most uncaring staff who can't even read an issue and respond. Myspace is a million times better than facebook. Best idea to anyone reading this, don't make an account on facebook with anything that isn't backed up in triplicate. Don't discuss anything personal on it like I did about my recent tragedy and remember to have back up accounts with everything and everyone that's important to you on it as they won't give a shitt if you lose everything. I even think I know who took over my account and begged facebook for help sending multiple messages and still nothing, they couldn't even reply with a ""we're looking into your issue"" and I even emailed their heads. Don't bother with them and don't make the same mistakes I made. My depression is now worse knowing I have lost priceless irreplaceable pictures, contacts and notes including my poetry and things to do with my book and my business pages all thanks to facebook not protecting it's users.

They  have not got anything inplace they dont have any card payment backup, you cant contact them and they do not monitor the scammers movement. They just tell you to report the seller or buyer and that it. They only allow you to be very wary all times, problem is that you need to make sure that the item for sale has not been stolen, or not working at etc. Most of the items I see tend to be fake or do not belong to them, some user do not want the buyer to check the state of the item.

You are there to be sold, traded, experimented upon (see ""Emotional Contagion"") Pages are forced to PAY for likes, to PAY to let their pages be seen.

""Mods"" who are not trained, vetted or monitored.  ""Mods"" who can download and keep any content they wish.

Extremely passive aggressive do as I not as I do punish one and allow others to make hateful false posts pertaining to my culture, my nationality my history of people.

Facebook violates the constitutional rights of the people, this app is on my phone and is my possession and I give them no permission what so ever to access my account in any form or fashion as my right as a so called American citizen but is this even proper treatment towards an American citizen to have no rights to do anything but what the caucasian people suggest a black American to do.

Since then their adverts became longer and longer going from 5 sec to 15 sec. Nowadays, if you pause the video, the thumbnail appears making you unable to stop to see the image you actually stopped the video for. These are all evidence of how fb became careless about your experience and only thinking their benefits. They know that people are still going to use Facebook as we have no choices.

It's no big loss because the account was for my dog.  I have a fluffy 100lb dog, friends/family love her and additionally we go back and forth w food/toy/vet/joint/play-date etc. narrative.   I'm posting this review because Facebook was really odd with regards to how they handled the recovery. Here's what happened:  Mar 16th - Out of no where I received a confirmation text of a change in my account.  I tried logging in and my password didn't work and saw the recovery email had been changed to an unknown email account.  Hence, I went through the recovery steps which were unsuccessful and FB subsequently requested I forward 2 forms of  identification.  Mar 18th - I received a response saying that I didn't attach valid form of ID...so I resent the info but this time with a photo of my drivers license (I was hesitant to send my drivers info but relented), never head anything back.... Mar 24th - Pinged Facebook for any follow up, no response so I tried logging in and this time the recovery steps worked but I was directed to my old FB personal account that I haven't used in over a decade and it's been like this since. So: The credentials for an FB account I created for my pup now work but they direct me to my defunct personal FB account.  Additionally, I can still access the defunct personal FB account using it's original email address but I have to use the password I created for my pup's account.  As for the pup's FB account, it's still out there and you can see it but you can't login to it.  Something just popped into my head, who would want to hack a dog's FB profile? Years ago I started 2nd guessing FB's usefulness due to stalkers/oddballs but decided it was best to stay away for privacy reasons.  Over time I softened up and created an account for my pup as it seemed a harmless task, a fun way to keep in touch and (aside from the hilarity) it turned out to be a really good way to share useful info.   Now, I'm not so sure.... 1 - You see, how on earth was someone able to change my primary email & pass without any confirmation?  I'd heard stories about things like that but assumed it was all down to stupidity.  Well I'm eating my words, this 'really' can happen.  Anyway, I received an account 'change alert' and it wasn't addressed to me and when I tried logging in, I couldn't.  Also, in the 'account recovery' process I could see the primary email had already been changed.   2 - I've had two FB accounts in my life, my pup's account and my personal account and both were independent of each other, different email, tel#'s and different recovery emails by design.  Work required separate mobile & messaging solutions and it didn't take long before I saw the benefits of this and decided this was a good practice to implement in personal areas.  FB used my drivers license to correctly identify 'me' in both accounts, then took the initiative to divert my pup's account login to my defunct personal account.  It looks like FB decided my pup's account wasn't necessary and would rather I start using my defunct personal account again.  Ironically, FB left the pup's profile intact, you can still see it, post to it and friend request it (although, you won't get any response).   I work in the financial industry and work recommends avoiding all social media unless necessary.  I think they're right.  If you find yourself needing social media, then identify the tasks (such as professional interests, notifications, general interests and so on) and create aliases, email accounts as needed to build a buffer that can provide a level of protection for yourself, loved ones, colleagues etc..",US

I've used all of Facebook's alternative means of contact--including sending drivers license and a silly picture with a handwritten code on it. No response from Facebook.

But I wish so that there was a better alternative. When I use it, from the moment I start till the moment I log out (I think) it's a chain of annoyances. First of all friends contact me because they see I am online. Eh.... I am sure that I am NOT online, but Facebook sometimes thinks so. This is an old bug. Come on Facebook, finally solve this! Then almost every week they invent something new. A GOOD firm would TEST those new pats of the program. Not Facebook. Or they test it in a very bad way. Also why all users have to use those new things. Give all users the opportunity to switch on or off big parts of Facebook.  I use my screen vertically, let's say, in portrait mode. Nah.... in that HUGE building in the USA apparantly nobody ever tested THAT situation. Sometimes buttons are not even visible. Go back from a live stream for instance is not possible.  Then we have Facebook, Facebook-lite, Messenger and Messenger-lite. All 4 also for phone. What the development team misses is some GOOD developers who lead the complete team of developers. THEY have to decide how things will be, so that it is not like now: the different teams try to copy each other, but they never succeed completely. Example: if you think you know all when you are experienced user of Facebook on computer, you feel a beginner when you ever try to use it on a smartphone. I can go on and write a book about it. SO many things are wrong. And then we have all over the world the teams that decide if you break their laws! Religious groups and people are allowed to post everything I guess. Atheist are not. One of my accounts is blocked forever because of that, on my present account I also got warnings. It's a kind of censorship conducted by amateurs who have never heard of freedom of speech.  In other words: I wish so that there was a good alternative for Facebook / Messenger. A kind of program that would do what Mark Zuckerberg SAYS. But not DOES. Oh yeh..... are there really still people who believe that Facebook is developed to connect people? Come on, the advertisers are more important and they really do everything to bring you the right advertisements. I am sure that I am not the only one who got MANY ads from suppliers of coffins after my parents died. But I got them. Now for them many times a day I type ""pretty girls"". ;) ;) You will be surprised what ads you see then! While it is still forbidden to write the site-name BongaCams in Messenger.

Firstly, it is a very handy social networking site if you want to stay connected to work colleagues, former school friends and distant family. This is my reasons behind using Facebook. Although, from personal experiences of being harassed, victimised and cyberbullied on this network by others I have come to a conclusion it would be so much easier to have people all over the world to be able to help support others on the social network like a form of a chat utility that is monitored solely by humans. I understand that there may be around 2.45 billion active users from around the world and 1:1 support would be somewhat impossible.  On the other hand, Facebook do have utilities on the site to allow blocking, unfriending, unfollowing and reporting of media shared, which is good. But I believe if something has been reported, Facebook should automatically close down the status/ video or whatever temporarily until Facebook has looked into it to avoid the user from deleting things off the post etc. so that they can see the full picture and take the best action. Generally a good site but I have had to keep making new accounts everytime I kept reporting the users instigating hatred as they were not against the Community Standards - I believe that this is because the users that were against me kept deleting their comments. It would be a good update for FB to temporarily close down reported posts etc so they can see as soon as it's been reported what people have said and done to get a realistic idea and choose the course of action on what to do next. 4 Stars due to the often misconceptions surrounding reported posts.",GB

Since then my son got one email from facebook about being reported and was limited to posting. The client ended up at this point blocking my son after few days my son got another email from facebook about being reported again this is twice.

When he enters it into the box and click on send, he will get the code when he enters the code into the box and click on next, a message will show up ""Your going to fast"". The next day after 24 hours he tried again this time i told him to enter my phone number so i got the code and he entered it into the box and again got the same message ""Your going to fast"".

To validate, if you are a real and the right user. Question: how does Facebook know? What do they compare with? Where do they get the right to ask a personal and private document from you? Did I mention, this is an account for an author... read pseudonym! So, I send the same image that I have used for both, the account and the fan page as profile image. 3 days no reply. Well, meanwhile the a promotion is running and I can't promote it on Facebook. Why? Because my account is still suspended. The work isn't done.

You can't contact support, but you actually need to send a valid ID now, in case your account has been suspended wrongfully. Btw, WHY was my account suspended? For creating an ad?

4626,www.facebook.com,2019-10-29T10:13:22.000Z,1,USE BUSINESS ADS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT FACEBOOK IS ABOUT,"Firstly Facebook is a business.  Facebook operates in numerous country‚Äôs, it has no respect for the laws in them. In fact it has proven time and time again that it is willing to pay fines rather than solve problems. Facebook is above the law in every country, and is now having meetings with our politicians.  Facebook was involved in brexit for its own personal agenda, they are now having meeting with one of the most deluded political party‚Äôs to ever exist in the U.K. #tories  To understand what Facebook is truly about you first need to be involved with Facebook advertising. Facebook for a start is NOT a platform for all ideas, nor is it truthful like savvy traveller states, in fact the complete and utter opposite. We do not owe Facebook any thanks or apology‚Äôs only an individual taking advantage of facebooks advertising systems and making money would state such a thing. Repeatedly, it‚Äôs the rich folks that keep splitting this nonsense. The ones who are financially stable are the ones that need Facebook to prop up their businesses. Facebook is a platform to make money at the cost of your personal information.  ‚Ä¢ Facebook as a business (Not a social network) does not provide the necessary means of complaints. (Rarely does they reply, if at all. It is the most outdated non existent complaints system the world has ever seen) this is detrimental to the running of a business and illegal not to have in some countries. But they just keep paying the politicians. ‚Ä¢ Facebook are categorically a bunch of liars. How savvy traveller could say they are not is beyond belief? Does savvy work for Facebook? Trey gowdy in fact has clearly proved every lie Facebook has told we don‚Äôt have to listen to their manipulation.  ‚Ä¢Facebook is allowed to close your account for any reason without any substance justified or not. They will do with without contact to the authorised owners of the social networking account.  ‚Ä¢Facebook clearly breaches privacy rules and has done for a long time. Will it matter? ... No ... Why? ... because information is valuable. Facebook offer the services of advertising.  You pay for an add, they put it in front of the audience you decide from the amount of users in its database, and based on either their actions devices location etc narrow it down and target your audience.  You are not guaranteed a sale - essentially it is gambling. These adverts alone are enough to get you removed from Facebook - so having an ad with text in excess of 20% will have you removed from Facebook. The excuses Facebook use to remove users from their platform amounts to discrimination. Why should a company be allowed to discriminate and cause public anxiety and frustration? Why should this entity be able to run around the world doing as they please?  Insulting whom they want? Restricting individuals right to speak and expose the wrongdoings these countries around the world play host to. We understand the situation of how Facebook started, and it was pure corruption at the greedy hands of Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg stood in front of his own constituents and lied and lied and lied, as red as the day came. It only has to be watched to be understood. It‚Äôs on tv there‚Äôs plenty of case study‚Äôs for the narrow minded people that can‚Äôt be bothered to search, but want to sit their and let their one sided brains lie to them.  Facebook is extremely manipulating and it‚Äôs characteristics cause widespread frustration.  I have used Facebook since the year after it was released and I can honestly say this is not a platform for anyone other than the ones that have a business. Anyone that doesn‚Äôt have a business you are a test case, you have products marketed to you through the actions you have taken whilst been a member on Facebook. Watch the tech lead on Facebook (a Facebook tech lead recently fired)  for having a YouTube channel.  It beggars belief that Facebook and google are the United States biggest spying network and that‚Äôs the sole reason they still operate with impunity. Didn‚Äôt trump start threatening people that was going to make Facebook and google taxable? YES. I had a Facebook account -  I also had another - I keep this account to keep my political opinions away from my family and friends they don‚Äôt want to see it nor do they need to, and also to keep advertising two stores that I have on Shopify. I reserve that right and it has nothing to do with Facebook if I own two accounts what‚Äôs the harm? ... nothing. Here‚Äôs the reason why it‚Äôs no problem ... everything I have stated on my secondary account be it political or not, has been true. Is it a spam account ... Hell NO.  Why Facebook dorsent have the right to shut secondary account - Facebook has been running for years, they have extremely well paid developers that can developer anything, literally. Now it‚Äôs pretty simple, if you open you‚Äôre Facebook app and login:sign up, with multiple accounts your account will be flagged as suspicious. If you open multiple accounts via your browser your account is fine, developer some software that reads from phones if they already have an account if they do don‚Äôt let them sign up, if they don‚Äôt let them sign up. Facebook will let you sign up run for a few weeks and then close you down and not refund you even if you have paid for adds. A very quick and fraudulent way of making money. Anyone who exposes this is called a liar.  Facebook doesn‚Äôt allow two accounts but does NOT state anywhere that is clear enough, or easy enough to direct to.  Facebook then closes your accounts or bans access to them, that‚Äôs all fine and dandy but... they send nothing along with it no email no ways of knowing what‚Äôs going on. Contacting Facebook is virtually unheard of, what makes this more concerning is that it is only too business they offer a way of contact but even that is a huge complaint.  It‚Äôs ironic the ones defending Facebook, either work for them or earn a stable income from them. The can side from the frustrations easier when they are comfortable in life, but when Facebook has the deliberate intentions of doing the opposite.m, which it has proved. Then you know it‚Äôs an absolute bunch of rubbish.  It‚Äôs a platform for solely advertising and that is it, everyone else are potential buyers.  I purchased a website recently, along with the social network account, noticed that the previous owners where still upto no good on my account, as Facebook clearly stated.  Could I get any help, nope. Same pattern from these and business owners around the world, just do as the please when they have made their sales. They just shut the account and that‚Äôs it. All bank details kept all information kept usual stuff no promise of removal of detail. I tried again and had the same problem. Funnily enough I purchased a different device and opened multiple accounts through the browser and they have been left to run. I deliberately did this on a different device, in a different location to the one I reside, ironically they stay open. Facebook either are extremely poor, how anyone could condone such actions from a group is just not comprehendable in 2019, it‚Äôs beyond belief. Great news for politicians though, they can keep advertising their lies. Well done mark... NOT.",GB

I had a personal page and a business page attached to it, a beauty blog. I had a lot of subscribers and friends. In October 3, I was logged out of Facebook, asking to send a selfie in order to enter again. I took a photo, attached and sent. The photo was ordinary, without filters, without editing. I waited 2 days, after which, when I tried to go to the page, I received a notification that I was blocked and if I believe that this happened by mistake, then I can send them a personal ID (passport). I took a photo of my passport (I live in Kiev, Ukraine) and sent it. I immediately received a response from Facebook technical support that my page was unlocked, an error occurred and now I can use it again. When I tried to enter Facebook, I got a window ""Your materials are under review."" And I can‚Äôt enter my page since October 3. I tried to write to the support service in the ""Login Problems"" form, tried to write to the technical support mail, with which they answered me about unblocking. I tried to write complaints that they hacked me. Nobody ever answered me. I have already written more than 100 letters, I have never received a response letter and for 3 weeks I can not use my page. Now two words about the reason of the block. On Facebook, I was threatened by one person who used multiple accounts. He was non-Russian and non-Ukrainian, muslim living in Europe, wanted to communicate, demanded intimate photos and threatened to find me to ‚Äúpunish‚Äù. I have all the evidence on mail (he wrote to me on the mail too) and in personal messages on Facebook. I sent requests for technical support on Facebook, which is threatened by a user of your social network, and I did not receive a single answer. Moreover, they blocked me, and this maniac continues to use the social network. A brief conclusion. I hate Facebook, they did not conduct any investigation of my complaints of harassment, they just blocked me, although I have ALL the evidence that I am I, that the page is just mine, that no one hacked me and that I was threatened by a crazy person. Facebook has double standards, I think they left it because the whole page of this crazy person is full of religious quotes and videos, so as not to infringe on his rights. Zuckenberg is only interested in personal profit, and Facebook technical support is either robots or Indians who don‚Äôt even read what users write to them.

It worked ok for that, but it also immediately just felt out of control. Aggressively pushing unwanted involvements with other peoples acquaintances and demanding my time to try to manage that, at a pace that I felt uncomfortable with.   It turned into a huge time sucking annoyance.   If you imagine experimenting with heroin, becoming addicted and unable to stop it, Facebook seemed to present the same kind of threat.  I instinctively recoiled from that.   Removing myself from Facebook was much more difficult than I would have hoped for.  It took me several attempts over a period of several days and help from a consultant just to to find the places where I could remove or close my account.    In the many years since, the measure of personal and propaganda risks that Facebook exposes it's account holders and our nations democracy to have become visible.  The addictive nature of it too seems to be real.  Only if it's users can and do turn it off, and force Facebook to be responsible for harms done by the content it conveys, will we know whether it can ever be made safe to use.   Disconnect.

They're afraid of a law-suit because their reasoning breaks civil rights laws. Wypipo complained about me because I didn't tip-toe around their fragile feelings, and I am a force to be reckoned with.  Too much power, too much control, and they do not apply the same standards across the board.  They even harassed me for putting a nickname in the middle of my first/last name; that was in 2016.  There are tons of names that aren't people's legal names, but they just couldn't stop themselves from harassing me. They shouldn't be allowed to do what they do, just because they can and everybody and their mother are afraid (or too broke) to file law suits against them.  'Zuck...the...f' is a hypocrite and allows his employees to do the very thing they promote against!  I think the government is in on their surveillance of non-white people.

Now last years quickly is turning worse and worse like a tumbling giant commercial deathstar that eat itself to death. Every time I go on fc now its.. MORE and  stupid MORE COMMERICIALS..so many !!  By putting them into the feedline now, instead of in the side of page its disrupting the hole flow of using it. The latest promoting for false crypto coins which seem to pop up everywhere now...I had enough !! it lost its simplicity too.. The hole lack of privacy thing aside its going DOWN and DOWN in quality. Facebook is sadly now a neverending capitalist engine of business living like a leach on our privacy and sharing with no intention of improving their model to original start of intension. I know from travelling around the world that there is many people who are close on leaving facebook now as its keeps getting worse and our hope that it will listen to users and change for bettter is now looking to never happen. its like when Michael J. Fox in the second movie goes to future and all has gone bad and only selfish commercial greedy interest rule the world. Its so yestersdays stoneage way to live... ..so backwards, cold and empty to live in that reality. Even with ton of money you will be feeling lost. Actually even more so..why ?..because when you got it all..and can do all...you sooner or later realize that thats not it ! where did the peace go ? you then overwelmed running around like a rabbit and become more and more numb to life. Feeling like nothing will help...solution is closer than you think...so simple..and your breakdowns is lifes way of showing you.. Why does the character, Mark Zuckerberg, wanna play the this lead bad guy role when he can be a hero is beyond my understand. With big privilege comes equal responsibility. To instead be a great part of positive direction in the world. Its always sad to see a good brilliant thing go bad. its  not too late to learn and change, Mark... I can only predict that like most other big companies that dont listen to customers and users in time..it will die slowly ..or suddenly fast...from users finding alternative ways...in this case how to stay in touch.  Its easy to create similar sites in this techworld without all these useless things build in. You need a level change..raise it to another level..have a fresh start.  WHY NOT ... make Facebook a nonprofit organisation ?? WORK for the greater good.. Promoting great things and help to make the world take a giant leap into the next evolution of mankind ? Supporting climate and good things in the world ? Its not rocket science.   Dear Mark,  Please START the positive change NOW.  its time to TRIM facebook and make the changes so we can be happy to use it again...else you know were we going..we will leave and you are left only with all the stupid people around.  Fire the stupid people instead !! Its more fun ! Shake the tree !! Like with beauty...simplicity is key....Less is more...TRIM the tree like a bonsai !.. cut..CUT..it will feel much better inside.. you know im right.  Make it a perfect tool for good ! Find back to your original playful essence of creating new things and opening up the world to share and bring us together.  Peace is there behind the madness. Thats where the simple joy in life is.

I have had Facebook on an off for about 6 years, and when I came to University I created a new account to use for societies and so on. I ended up deleting it, and creating a couple of other accounts in succession before having a change of heart and similarly deleting them. No problems there, no harm was done. A few days ago, I try and create a business page on Facebook for a brand that I am setting up. I get told I need to create another personal account in order to do this. No bother, I use the same email address that I have used for all the other platforms which I have created accounts on for my brand. Everything is going fine, the personal account is created (with no profile picture, but I was going to get to that) and I get on with creating the business page. Right in the middle of this I get logged/kicked out and asked to do some security stuff (the details escape me) and then to upload a photo to verify my identity. I do so, and I am happily greeted with a page telling me that I cannot access Facebook at the moment while they verify my photograph to make sure it is me... when there should not be anything on their system which could help identify me in the first place. I waste hours of an evening only to find out that Facebook's user 'support' is one of the greatest and most pathetic jokes on the internet. They ignore pleas for help on Twitter, bury pages in their poor and lazy 'Help Centre' (which is anything but helpful) and if/when staff do get back to you they parrot back responses that appear copy-pasted, lazy and impersonal. When someone does get back to you, they will often say that 'they can't help you' for X or Y and link back to their damn 'Help Centre'. They even ask you to send in a form of identification (e.g. passport) like they are some sort of government agency.  They do not tell you directly why your account was disabled, you have to dig and find that out for yourself. You can submit a request to have it reviewed, but you cannot provide any details or a personal message. Not that it would matter, you'd likely get an automated reply. No chat support system, no clear email address to contact, negligent support on the likes of Twitter on top of the censorship and manipulation of the public mean that I will never go near Facebook again and neither should you. If I do manage to get back into my account (emphasis on the 'If') I will go straight to deleting my account. I never felt the need to create a Trustpilot account before, but Mr. Zuckerburg was that impetus.",GB

4845,www.facebook.com,2019-05-14T13:17:26.000Z,1,Crusade against Estonian language and culture,"I joined Facebook from my daughter request to be ""connected with family and friends"" over ten years ago. My daughter still lives in Estonia while I have been ""homeless traveller"" in southern part of Europe. After joining, I started to get several friend request from the persons from my childhood and my previous life to be connected using this service.  That's what this platform supposed to be?  As tolerant person, I sometimes accepted ""friend requests"" from strangers, but in first attempt to sell me some ""unsecured loans"" or present views outside my acceptance level, I immediately unfriend those and blocked for further attempts and to read my posts. That's what I call a censorship?  In 2009 I met some guys introducing Facebook SDK for me. As I had figured out, that some ""StartUp""s music discovery algorithms are not the best, I had an idea for my own music discovery app and as Facebook promised their data for me to use, I took the hook. However, this was a bad decision as Facebook constantly removed features used and finally started to demand ""credit card and utility bills"" from me?  It was a free app and never in my life, I haven't been involved such kind of scam like ""credit card"". And I purchase my cooking gas from bottles and one solar panel should be enough for my electricity needs, even I wrote this app in public library. Next time they want my grocery shopping list before they can make the decision, is my app OK?  That demand clearly shows that their objective is not to be connected with your friends and family, but to sell you questionable agreements and ""unsecured loans"".  So, I had to rewrote my algorithm to use device music library instead (as recommended by Apple staff at first place) and this improved my algorithm results a lot.  I still had Facebook SDK binary included to my app, until somebody notified me about SpyWare in my app, so I had to remove this and afterwards at least my app is SpyWare free.  However, I still had invested to this app, my book and film project Facebook pages, so I hoped that maybe those are useful to marketing purposes.  That was again false hope. The $100 campaign to my book didn't result not a single purchase and even I has link to my app page inside my app, this made lot of visits but not a single like. By replacing it with the link to my app AppStore page, it started to get ratings and reviews there.  But I still had a platform to be connected with my friends and family? Not much longer as Facebook started a campaign to redefine Estonian language and Culture.  At first, I was surprised that all my friends are constantly getting 30 days ban to post for stupid reasons. So have Facebook defined Estonian National Eepos to be ""hate speech"", awarded and respected Estonian writers are getting banned to promote their work, people are punished by their political views, being a Christian is punished there, etc.  For me the final blow was, when Facebook decided that post from years ago, which isn't even mine as I had shared it, is rassistic because it contained a word ""murjam"". ""Murjam"" is the word from my childhood children books, where we learned how children in Africa are living and where very popular on those days. And it got another meaning, when we as children went outdoors to play and returned with our muddy and dirty clothes, so our mom told us: ""you look like a murjam"". So, being aware of childrens in other culture is defined ""rassistic"" nowadays? So, I informed my friends that Facebook has banned to use words ""murjam"" and ""tibla"" in their platform.  And in minutes I was banned to post or comment at all? Obviously Facebook employees nowadays reading every post and discussion!  As there is still Institute of Estonian Language and Culture, who defines words meanings and not mr. Zuckenberg!  I had even Iincluded links to Estonian official language dictionary to that post. But as any dictator acts, their decisions are the only one which are right decisions!  Previously, I assumed that Facebook censors are looking for posts somebody has reported to them, but seems that they listen and go back for anything you have discussed inside your friends and family. Even Soviet KGB didn't much care what and how you are discussing inside your friends and family, so it Facebook had made the society much worse than it was during authoritarian regimes by it's SpyWare, constant monitoring of private discussions and even selecting, what kind of words we are allowed to use!  I would call mr. Zuckenberg a ""tibla"", because that what this word in Estonian language means. It's a person, who does not care about other nations and cultures and becomes to demand, that everything should be as they wanted by their rules. Even becoming to Estonian language during Soviet occupation era, it does not refer only to Russians, but it refers to persons from any arrogant nations!",FR

Facebook claimed to be a platform, a town square where all views could be aired and discussed, this meant they were not responsible for the content posted on their site, so if some views led to people being harmed they disavowed all liability, but then they started banning people for wrong think, those people that did not think in the far left manner, those people that resisted and went against the narrative published in the Media or spouted by Leftist Governments. They started to censor people.

I paid for advertising once a couple of years ago in the hope of getting access to people who lived in London and were likely to attend punk music gigs.  I was not happy with the results and so have not paid to advertise since then.  I am still getting regular emails suggesting I may wish to promote some of the posts I make in groups with which I'm connected. No thank you though.

I totally do NOT like the way FB works. It is a social media platform, yes. Initially it was only for social networking but it has been almost 5-6 years it has become a highly commercial place for social media influencers. The Facebook users are not seen as socialising people but only as highly capitalistic consumers, nothing more than that. And the WORST part is unlike all other big companies, FB does not have a real consumer forum, or customer care. If you fall into any trouble or if you want to complain about anything in FB, there is no real person who will handle the issue and you will keep getting an automated response forever.  All of it does not sound a big deal right? No, it is a big deal. Anything without a judiciary system should not be trusted. I fell into trouble with FB regarding the payments through FB. They blocked my payments suspecting me as fraud when all I did was to claim a refund from paypal for a valid reason. Now no matter how many times I write them to unblock my payments on FB, it cannot be done. Why because there is no one to resolve this matter, literally no one. I keep getting automated responses that my payment has been deactivated due to security reasons. I cannot talk to anyone, I cannot explain anything. All I could do was upload my id and still receive the same response. And it is annoying. A good service provider has to have a resolution centre, a real one not automated mail sending robots.

I just joined couple of days ago, this was my very first attempt since Facebook is out on the market. I never really waned to join, everyone was asking, but I felt, your privacy is compromised in some ways, and I am a private person. So I kept on bouncing it back. Until just recently, when I decided to join and give it a go. My children have all Facebook accounts for several years now. So my daughter helped me to create the account, I uploaded a good photo, and invited others to join my account.  After like two days I received a mail from Facebook that my account was suspended. What??? Why? one may ask. We tried to contact Facebook admin to find out, u cannot contact them easily. They sent a generic e-mail where u can put your complain, blah,blah...that's it. It is most probably connected somewhere...God knows where...to a remote computer, somewhere in Timbuktu, which will send u a very generic answer. It is programmed like that, so they don't need to worry and solve issues.My account is still suspended. I have no chance to find out how to rectify it, or what they want, or what u need to do. Nothing of the kind.Some personnel touch to the problem would be good. Nothing. No number to ring, no person to talk.  And for them this is a normal way of conducting the business. As they have now billions of people on their account obviously they will not care if they lose one or two. I am not sure even if they read these reviews, most probably they don't give a damn what anyone thinks. I had to give one star, until I hear back from them, from someone...anyone as a matter of fact. If their business would spread word by mouth....well it is not much I can really recommend. Cheers..",AU

Apart from fumbling around trying to learn how to adjust settings etc. ( 63 year old tech illiterate) I'd made one comment to a fellow Australian regarding a Telco we share. I passed on information I'd received from the authorities and advised him to check it out for himself. I don't know if that upset anyone but for some reason I was suspended while they investigated suspicious activity. I was then asked for a photo which immediately made me think it was purely a personal information gathering exercise. I sent them a very clear photo of me showing how many minutes it would take me to delete my account. One minute in fact. I think they misinterpreted the gesture as an angry old Australian guy thinking he's been conned into giving up more personal information. My account was then disabled. So no way to delete the account. I then sent them a photo of my licence with details other than my name, date of birth and photo covered, all matching my account details and previous photo, just to get in and delete the account and it's still disabled. I have now sent them a note saying if they don't delete the account it's the only thing I'll be doing so hopefully that will be the end of it. Just a total con job to gather people's personal information. I should've added as for service not one email advising me of what's going on. The only way I find out anything is by trying to log on.

I‚Äôve had an issues with my business address constantly changing to an unknown incorrect address that has no relevance to my business. Because the address being displayed is directing clients to another location,  I‚Äôve tried contacting the technical team to rectify this issue. But  I am yet to hear anything from Facebook. To be honest I‚Äôm just fed now. For me I find it so hard to believe that such a large company as Facebook, doesn‚Äôt have in place a technical team that service users can connect with either via live chat or emails. This is a basic necessity, so why is this???? Although they provide a form for you to report issues, the simple fact is that they do not do anything, rather after a short period of time your issue is closed down without anything being done. So what‚Äôs the point???? Having the correct details displayed regarding any business is a very important factor to growth of any busnesss,  so why can‚Äôt Facebook rectify this issue????   What makes it worse, is that the issue is also affecting other social media platforms such as Instagram. Clients either can‚Äôt find me or they end up check-in inton a location with the incorrect address. All I‚Äôm going to say is that from my experience, unless you are a multimillionaire company that generates millions. Facebook isn‚Äôt going to bother with your query because you do not matter.",GB

It is the perfect State spying interface, allowing intelligence agencies to map a person's life in ways that would have horrified us decades ago.  Yet, for millions of people it appears to remain 'cool' to have a Facebook page.  I think 'how uncool...to comply with the establishment that treats us all like animals in a zoo'. Facebook clearly functions as an arm of State surveillance and censorship, regularly responding to whatever political whims of the day are issued from Washington as the US aspires to world super-bully status.  For example, deleting accounts associated with Iran just because Trump wants to pressure Iran into subservience to Israel's fevered imperialism.

With that being said they have left open appeals that should not have been Appeals and now they continue to block me three times in the last couple of weeks saying I have too many things posted that violate the policies. One item was a ring one was a kid's game one was it vase and so on. Seems that a computer is doing this and they need to have a person, a human being look at what's going on so it can be fixed. Yesterday they told me I'm permanently removed it's so unfair. I've spoken to a few other sellers they said they've never heard of this before being a problem like this especially when you didn't post anything violating the policies. There's no customer service support. They launched this to the public and to the buyers and the sellers and they have no support as far as customer service goes.  Provide some coaching Facebook and share what is going on so it can be corrected that seems like the fair thing to do if you truly feel certain things should be posted and there seems to be confusion. please share why it says that your appeal will be reviewed within 24 hours and then it's still sitting there since the beginning of May and do to your lack of reviewing the appeals that I've been blocked. too bad that you shove the good people under the rug and allow so many other things to go on on Facebook very sad.",US

A sad reality for many. Detoxing from Facebook after an admittedly severe addiction has been similar to that of when a Pornstar finds Christ, it opens up a world of time, energy and freedom you never knew you had and brings to light just how damaging social media can be and whilst Facebook can be and is great for keeping in touch with people, the truth is‚Ä¶ So is a phone call.  In 2018, Facebook stands as a hive-mind of narcism and negativity ran by the poster child of humanoid reptilians himself, Mark Zuckerberg.

You'll connect with friends, friends of friends and that one guy who you avoid at work but add for the simple fact that it makes you seem more popular, the fun never ends and years from now when humanity is even more self absorbed than before, where ""likes"" and ""follows"" are a legitimate currency and modern trends are as fickle and ill-thoughtout as the UK government, we'll have Facebook to primarily thank.

This online 'social' network is to a large extend shielded from the rest of the open internet, like a dark web community. Facebook wants you. You have to be a member of their elite network, uploading your real photo and completing your profile in order to view the majority of it. Unfortunately most people of my age and even many older folks that I know are not so smart; they are FB members. They feel the need to eat this 'free lunch' and share photo's of their relationships, kids, holidays, important life events, like this and that, answer where they've studied, fill in where they grew up etc. Even my (questionable?) physician and former teachers are now part of this network, sharing photo's of their private lives. What they don't (want to) understand is that FB is not a free service. These people trade a social network service for everything they upload on FB. These people don't care or don't know that FB's intention is to sell all member data to governments, institutions and businesses around the globe. These people want to be slaves of the system, they want to be manipulated in the surveillance state that this world is increasingly becoming, thanks to mass data hoarding. They want to wake up in a system where their insurance is going to say: ''hey Kyle, I recently read your FB post about fitness, how about we give you a discount on your premium?'' and ''hey Tailor, you haven't been so transparent these recent months online, how about we increase your premium?''. Or how about Taylor's ex partner or unsatisfied customer who decides it's time to ruin her life forever online? These attention seekers want that world. And you know what? They will get it one day, but then it's too late..",NL

I recently set up a new account, using a name that although was not my birth name, was still a valid name that I used daily. Facebook waited until I had become involved in a numberof groups and pages, before shutting down my profile with no warning whatsoever.  They requested I send them proof of who I was - but would not accept any explanation as to why I couldn't send the proof they requested (basically, a passport or drivers license photocopy).All I recieved was an automated response that was barely disguised as being from a real person, stating the information I had given them was not a valid passport or license copy. I eventually sent them a copy of my passport , just so they would read an e-mail I had sent to them, and to confirm that I was a real person and not some strange stalker-type weirdo who had set up a new profile to hurt someone. I also included links to my online store that clearly shows the name I use as being identical to that of the Facebook profile I had set up, as well as yet another eplanation as tothe name being used.. The reply was almost inane compared to the question I had asked about reinstating my profile. ""You need a page"" they stated -nothing else ... no explanation on how to get my profile reinstated, or reason as to why it was disabled in the first place. No true conversation has been achieved with Facebook - just automated replies that pretend to be from a real person. Since December 2017, they won't even reply to my e-mails at all. Apparently, I don't exist (much the same as their customer service). Facebook does not care about their users - they just want to make money. They ban pages and profiles for unjust reasons, and yet let paedophiles and criminals do 'business' through their site. They need to put the human face back into facebook, and start interacting realistically with their users. Sadly, I am still  facebook user, using a differnt proile- but only to keep in contact with some family. As soon as I can, I will delete all accounts and tell them in no uncertain terms to ""shove it where the sun don't shine!"" If I could give zero or negative stars, I truly would.

When the event had expired I cancelled the ad, but still got messages from Facebook telling me how my ad is continuing to perform.  I went into my ad manager and deleted the ad.  I continued to get messages telling me how many people my ad reached, and at the end of the month I was not only billed for the ad again, but they automatically took the payment from my paypal account. To top it off, when I checked my reach for my posts they were much less than they were before I had placed the ad.

I've had people claim, science means nothing, and it don't matter if someone is committing fraud as long as it makes people feel better. Avoiding the groups on things you love, interests, hobbies, bands, stars, etc is the way to go.   The only thing Facebook is good for is finding friends of family you have lost contact with, (or people you are stalking) but even then you will need to know there full married names and or locations. Being that you have lost contact with these people you probaly won't have this information, making it only good for stalking people you know details of. Which leads me to, if you have an abusive ex, ex friend, or just a stalker who wishes to know your personal life and or give you grief best you struggle with the hundreds of different settings to make your profile invisible to anyone not already on your friends list, again making anyone with good intent trying to find you impossible.  Furthermore,  they changed the messaging service so you now have to install another app and risk all your personal information on another platform.  No one ever gets banned or punished for there rude, extreme or aggressive abusive messages. You can block people so they cannot abuse you further but this does not stop there extremist views being pushed on and threats being made to others. They also try to force you to upload I.D of yourself personally so they can verify your name, this seems hugely inappropriate and they should just accept they created a platform for trolls and abuse and should shut down there website if they cannot control the problem not police the users like a corrupt government. The only real actual use of Facebook is communicating between friends and family, which you could use a phone for and as such bypass all of the other problems with this service.",GB

Auughhh.  2, They don't show your posts to a lot of people. I get very few reaction for my effort and they are brilliant efforts. I try to be funny, inspiring, insightful etc, but Facebook only shows my post to very few people which can be frustrating. 3, They are even worse with pages. They want you to sponsor your post to reach a lot of people. So they show your posts to between 2 to 3 percent of your entire likers! That is indecent. 4, They allow a lot of nonsense. And they put it on my lifeline. Most of this nonsense is fake news and soft porn from groups that I am not even a member of. I try to report this posts but there is no button to do that. I have to block these people one after the other. And for each one you block, two take their place. Sigh. 5, They put you in groups you didn't accept to join. Once someone adds you to a group you automatically become a member! This is wicked.

The price was 173‚Ç¨ but I got a discount and paid 155‚Ç¨. I walked to my hotel about half a mile from the shop, changed in my room and went to the pool. When I laid down on sunbed I took of my new sunglasses and one if the nose supports stuck to my nose. Bad luck I thought and walked back to the shop after about 2 hours by the pool ‚Äì so I was back about 4 hours after I bought the sunglasses. I was asked to go to another shop, the main shop further up the street. When I got there the two girls in the shop first tried to but the nose support back on but was unable and offered to repair the sunglasses, but then I would have to wait a day or so. I asked for a replacement or a refund. They did not have the same model and they offered me to pick another pair of sunglasses, which I went on to do. While I was looking at other sunglasses they found a scratch, they were unable to show me this scratch but both the girls said there was a scratch. Now back in my hotel I am still unable to find the scratch. They now refused to take the sunglasses back and again offered to repair them. Since I am unable to wait for the repair that was not an option. So, I am left with a pair of unusable, but quite expensive sunglasses for the rest of my vacation. I bought, what I thought was a quality pair of sunglasses to avoid them breaking and I bought them at what appeared to be a real store and not just a tourist trap ‚Äì clearly, I was wrong. I did get very upset by the treatment and I would wish there was grounds for legal actions including reporting the shop to the police. However, it seems quite obvious that this is not a matter for neither the police or the judicial system (no matter how upset I am) ‚Äì it is simply a case of bad business ethics. Consequently, all I can do is to warn and discourage anyone from trading at either of the solid gold stores in Bugibba.",MT

Facebook has helped users like me connect with family members, old classmates of many years ago, friends and people of my choosing based on shared interest. Also, it allows me to share my best pictures and see what friends think of it on the comment and like section. Facebook has a section for users to say what's on their mind and express their mood at any point in time and also, text and post videos. It is a really great way to engage your leisure and also grow your business!  I am able to play games, watch videos, customise my page, share favorite product information, ""like"" favorite celebrities and social causes, live-stream video, connect with goods and services, and live-chat via Messenger.                                Facebook's versatility and so much functionality has saved lots of people via it's marketing platform where companies can reach a wider audience of about 1.6billion registered users from all over the world! statistics provided by Facebook for instance  reveals that as of March 2014 there were 1.28 billion active users on the site per month, and at least 802 million of these users logged into Facebook every day. With statistics such as these, it is not surprising that Facebook is the most popular Social Networking Site in the world.

It is a great social media site in which friends can easily get together.  This is contrasted by -  2. It is supposed to be a censored site. I am no prude but some of the language used I can't accept. I remember some time ago, I requested Facebook intervene. My request message was ignored. With that, I promptly closed my Facebook account (I thought). 3. Some time later, I discovered that, even though I thought the account was closed and I'm not using it, it was still active. Because of this, I considered I may as well use it again. 4. Lately, I have been getting many messages from Facebook, saying, ""Your account has been logged into from near ..........."". Very interesting,  because I have not been to these places, some of which are 400 kilometres (250 miles) away. These are obviously illegal logins or a major discrepancy. Either way, Facebook don't want to know about it or offer any advice. So, how do I fix the problem? No-one knows. I could find no phone number or e-mail address, to contact. I even wrote ('snail-mail') to Facebook. I expected them to realize I was serious in trying to find a 'fix' to the apparent problem. This was approximately a month ago and I'm still waiting for a reply (or even, an acknowledgement). It appears that Facebook have no intention of enforcing their own rules. Also, there appears to be no way of getting accurate advice from them. Yes, Facebook is interesting and socially, great. No, I still can't recommend it.",AU

I dedicated a lot of hours on Facebook as it was part of my High School, University, 1st Job and its still playing the same outstanding role in my life. As you guys continue gathering people with different culture and backgrounds into one place to share ideas and discuss thoughts that can actually create a difference in people life`s. But so far for the last 3 years i didn`t found a lot of changes in the platform it self as you guys still do a lot of upgrades and add new features and always we are ""MENA region"" the last who gets provided by these upgrades. This is not fair treatment also not what i expected from a platform that i trust my personal data and my life updates on. So if you guys don`t want us to abandon your platform ""Its already happening"" you better do some serious changes in the platform services. We need to feel that this platform is creative again.",US

People can duplicate your profile picture without any approval, and it's not against facebook's community standard . In Facebook, there is no regulation about ""if you use gender as male, you should put name as a boy or a man not as a woman"". People also can share any pornograph picture or video, Facebook will removed it if someone report it, it's too late for it-you know. Facebook should prevent before its share, not after its share. I really dissapointed for this, and I hope facebook reviewed my review as an advice for facebook's better tomorrow. Thanks",US

However, one think is missing, and it's kinda critically essential: just let me see who's seen my posts, just like what 'that other social networking app' do (sorry for comparing, but frankly, this feature is what I seek for eternity!). It's like: You see your posts, and the posts let you know who's seen your posts, because rhetorically, Facebook users just look at the posts, and scroll down. That's it, no trace: no likes, comments, etc. So, it keeps me wondering, is my post unnoticed? In conclusion, just let the users see who has seen their posts (like: seen by X friends). And, I'm really sorry for comparing this with 'that other social networking app', but seriously, this may really helpful for anyone who's living their life with 'like-less/comment-less' posts, including me.

6043,www.facebook.com,2016-02-11T09:34:39.484Z,3,"Great Concept, Terrible Execution","The core idea of Facebook is being able to get all the people you know into one place where you can keep tabs on, talk to, and otherwise share experiences with no matter where you are in the world. Imagine a forum where everyone in the world has access at the touch of a button.   Now imagine tons of spam, unwanted suggestions, creepy strangers, invasive security and Big Brother also here in this one place because that's exactly what Facebook is today. Not only does it often feel like absolutely anyone can look at and like your child's posts (shared with friends from school), but sometimes even personal information gets shown publicly during one of the various moments when Facebook breaks something.   I LOVE that Facebook allowed me to get in contact with people I used to go to school with, and family that I hadn't heard from in forever. What chaffs is all the garbage Farmville posts, friend suggestions with total strangers, and the constant pressure to share every single song, actor or pizza topping I've ever liked. And you can't tell it ""No"", because Facebook doesn't listen to ""No"". It hears, ""ask me later"", which it will do the next time you come by. You can hide posts, you can block people, but you can't ever get rid of Facebook's persistence without.. you know.. actually leaving.   Their mobile app sounded nice at first, too, but they kept updating and changing and making unnecessary tweaks or needing access to who knows what on your phone, so I dropped that over a cliff.   However, as I said, at its core Facebook is both useful and a really great idea. There's a lot of people who use the service so the odds of someone you know being there are quite high, making it easy to look up old friends or displaced relatives.",US

If you report a photo of someone smoking  dope on their timelines (like I did) the site gives no credit to it but if you place a review on a business that they protect then the review is removed and you are advised that further ""violations' to their standards will result in having your account suspended. This is called censorship. Another pristine example of this repetitive behaviour was when I reported the abusive behaviour of a hotel manager that kept sending extremely offensive and defamatory messages via Facebook. Once again, it got reported to Facebook and they ignored it. The case was judged in court and the hotel manager was ordered to pay compensation for the damages caused to myself.

It means for every 100.000 users it is only one costumer service, and this it creates massive gab to communicate direct with Facebook costumer service.    Other problem for online businesses who use Facebook to promote brands is that many brands  use wrong strategy where they focus on building large number of fans, instead of building interactions and communicating with the  fans and sharing idea how to improve the services, we must understand ,branding it is much cheaper than marketing. Some of the Users who use Facebook to chat and link with friends and families, they think Facebook is dating site  that is massive mistake. We must remember Facebook it works same as we chat and talk with people on real life, and is no need to think Oh I am on Facebook and I can talk and do whatever I like as no one can see me , and no one know about me.(if you try to use fake name) what is the point? who going to take you serious,?

Are the posts not controlled on here? I have seen numerous links, images and videos on this website that can be quite triggering or just generally disturbing.  That is not the only thing that can be found here. Sexism, Racism, Bullying and more are quite frequent on facebook.  After numerous reports and still nothing being done to remove or monitor content, That's when alarm bells start ringing.   The only reason I continue to use Facebook on the odd occasion is too keep up with friends and family who I have no other way too communicate, It would be nicer if the posts were more monitored though.   For me, Facebook is more trouble then its worth, If you don't want the drama or are easily disturbed or can be quite vulnerable, I would recommend staying away from here.",GB

Surey facebook is the most staker friendly site I've ever encountered. But when the whole ""online/offline"" thing is bugged, it can piss some people off badly. Sometimes people show online despite logging off hours ago, I've been told I was online when I was sent a message, even though I wasn't. Should've left it at being able to deactive chat / have it activated, no more. I have days where I don't want to talk, if I accidently click a message that was unopened, that other person is either gonna be sad or pester me.   I like the facebook minigames, and I like the overall design. I'd really wish that the people who don't like to play games could disable ALL game invites. It's not easy to pick 20 people out by names on your friendlist, whenever you send those mass-game requests which the mini-games offer. Not all games enable you to send requests to people who aready play the game, only. :(",DK

6483,www.facebook.com,2014-09-26T16:02:41.000Z,3,"Am I rating it or me? Both, I believe.","I was pulled into Facebook by an email from someone who wanted me to be his 'friend'. He was already my friend, so I had no idea what he was going on about, however I followed the link, intending to give him some click to confirm rather than ignore him, but found I actually had to Join the thing to do so. I was tempted to phone him to say 'nothing personal, but you're going to have to accept that i am your friend, without my having to join some official club in order to prove it to you'.   However, I decided to join, in the unlikely event that it might be in any way of interest to me.    That seemed to put me on some kind of a map, and I was soon getting emails from more people wanting me to be their 'friend'. Each time, I had to find and apply my login details in order to validate the friendship I thought they already had with me. After a few months, these interruptions began to dwindle, and I only have to log in about once every three months.   Occasionally, I am told that people have 'written things on my wall', so I log in. It is a lot of effort to do things which can more easily be done by phone, email or forum. Worse still, I seem to be in the centre of irrelevant, even idiotic information trying to grap my attention of my clicks. Somebody was desperate to get a virtual ingredient to make a virtual cocktail in order to get a virtual-bartenders' certificate. What collyrot! But I wincingly and, I admit, patronizingly decided to click to assist them in their pointless ambition; and found that to do so, I had to liberate my entire address book to the organizers of the virtual bar, presumably so that I become implicated in spreading this.   Therefore, I go on Facebook only when I am called, am unimpressed each time, and I log off ASAP.   There are, however, many millions of people who like spending time on it - it obviously 'works'. Even some of my real-life friends tell me that it helps them to 'keep in touch'.   When reviewing, I typically feel secure and confident that I am assessing the quality of a 'thing in itself'. But, regarding Facebook, I realise I am reviewing a product which works, but which I have no interest in, like a chicken-sexing kit. The serious difference between Facebook and chicken-sexing kits, both of which, I assume, achieve their objectives, is that the latter does not force itself into my awareness, nor recruit my friends to be part of its marketing.",GB

It's like queuing up at the cinema to buy a drink, knowing you're about to get a good rogering by the cinema staff for what is essentially water (free) and sugar (next to free). But, you're there to have a 'good time', and your friends are looking on, and maybe you even have a date so it would look weird if you didn't get a drink.   I mean, sure, people would understand, and they would say 'oh no, its good that you didn't - they're not good value' but they still think you're weird. And such is the same of Facebook.   Everyone is Facebook, everything happens on Facebook, I can't imagine a Facebookless life simply because its where I talk to my friends, acquaintences, find out about goings on and generally keep up with social circle. I use google+ too, which is fun, but it doesn't have the adoption required to be a required website.   So, what's wrong with facebook? It can be slow, a lot of the time. It can be buggy, a lot of the time. Whenever I chat to someone, I need to close the browser and reopen it every 5 or 6 minutes, because its crashed the process. Yet my google talk in gmail can be left on all day.   I don't like the lack of transparency or the cognition of privacy on facebook. They basically say 'The settings are there! It's up to you!' but they ASSUME that you want to share. This means, if you absent mindedly click (like 90% of people), you will end up sharing fairly quickly. It's like the opt-in / opt-out organ donor debate. Except, giving facebook the right to share my stuff is less high on the priority list than giving little Jimmy what's left of my retinas after I succumb to a horrible but thankfully brief death at the hands of an overworked and underpaid bus driver who wasn't looking the right way at the right time.   Facebook works. I use it every day because I don't have an alternative.   But I don't like it.",GB

In some cases, this happens despite me having 7 or 8 mutual friends with that person.   2   One of my friends sent a ""friend request"" to someone she thought she knew. That person reported her and my friend was banned for a week from making any friend requests. No chance to explain or anything, just treated her with contempt.   3   Worst of all, there are many business pages who use Facebook to gain new customers and then scam them. These sites use images that breach copyright and they block anybody who posts a negative comment or asks a question they don't like. While we can be blocked and scammed by these businesses, there is no way on Facebook for us to report these companies who abuse Facebook.

It had become a genuine 'Social Network'. Clearly, fast evolution is required in any early E-Project if it's to grow and survive in such a competitive world but after a while you simply have to STOP TWATTING about with it!

Being able to 'stream' various groups and categories of interest is valuable, as is the ability to upload photos and link to videos and music.     One thing I would NEVER do, though, is assume that it's free from hackers. I make sure NEVER to link Facebook to other internet activities and sites, and I am very vigilant about the amount of information I place there - even with full privacy controls in place, I would never, for example, be stupid enough to give my correct birthdate - identity thieves are everywhere.

Cos, you WON'T be able to pretend your kids are made of sugar, your spouse is straight out of a fairy tale and your holiday and wedding snaps beat the royals any day.  Also if you are a female aged 60+ pls don't join, as you won't comprehend that EVERYONE YOU ADD (and some public members) can read EVERYTHING on your wall posts. ie ""Hi Mavis, I had my pile operation,  my ringer isn't so sore now, sitting on an ice pack, Bill can't have anal for a few weeks, hope you are well, write back soon, much love Jean xx "" it isn't exactly private! But they dont know how to bloody use it!!  Random  faces that come up of friends of friends? You get bombarded with friends of friends ie folk you will never meet in a lifetime . You will be bombarded with requests from weirdos! Some will shock you with their racism and filth, and you will never be done reporting and blocking the idiots! Also, you get sent send stupid game requests and childish quizzes across to you and access all your info.  I LOVE IT lol cos am  constantly prying and am astounded by everything people willingly reveal. They happily share their name age where they stay and even phone number and places of work and kids pics and not even hidden. dates of birth, times they were born, holidays they are on, great for burglars and fakers of ID! WOW,  didnt even know my next door neighbour was doing half the stuff those naughty pics tsk tsk, hope his boss doesnt find the ones with Wotsits up each nostril!
