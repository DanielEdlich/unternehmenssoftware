I'm actually sad at the amount of ads I see on TV and other places for their services—and how many people get trapped into their plans. Not only have I seen ridiculous prices in the past for what's included in the plans, but their server speed and WordPress performance is TERRIBLE. I've been a web designer for 7+ years, and GoDaddy has singlehandedly been the absolute worst and slowest host to deal with.  My clients have constantly had issues pop up with their WordPress website, and it's extremely annoying that they ban certain plugins from getting installed to your website. For example, you can't install most backup, caching, and security WordPress plugins due to ""compatibility"" issues with their network. (I've never seen this issue with other hosts.)  Not only this, but their support system is awful. Though they have some friendly representatives, it's extremely hard to get a hold of them. Most times I've reached out to them, I was put on a 30-minute hold, and usually the request goes through many people before they even get to it. The live chat function doesn't work. The ""texting"" SMS support never gets back to me. Do yourself a favor and stay FAR away!",US

This issue with emails was caused entirely by a migration to Microsoft Office365 which we did not sign up for or agree to, and was handled appallingly.  GoDaddy how can you expect customers to pay for services you DO NOT PROVIDE. Businesses trust you and you have let us down immensely with no sign of compensation or apology.

186,www.godaddy.com,2023-01-13T20:08:58.000Z,3,Don't be fooled. You'll have access to TRIAL site builder when buying a domain,"The process to get your domain is straightforward. What is not is the wording and marketing about what you get when you sign with GoDaddy. By the time this review is being written, the wording on their ads and website is that by buying a domain with them you have access to their website builder (save that word, ""access""). When you do have your configuration set and ready to go prior to adding things to the cart, one of the options read ""Start building your website for FREE"" yes, with capital letters, and yes, save that term ""Start building"" Although this is not considered a lie, this is just misleading.  When you're shopping domains, you'll face several companies trying their best to lure customers in. The way GoDaddy is doing this is to avoid at any costs to mention the word TRIAL. That's when the marketing department is working hand-to-hand with the legal department to avoid being sued. Getting back to the terms used: When they say in their ads that buying a domain will give you access to their website builder, they're not lying. You'll have access to it. When they say you can start building your website for FREE, they're not lying, you'll START (that's the word that should be in caps) building the website. However, all that is just the marketing to lure you in and add things to your cart. Once the payment is processed and you receive the thank you message, you'll have access to your dashboard. Only then, you'll see that the access you have to the website builder is just the trial. The same trial you would have if you were just curious about knowing how this tool actually performs. But what now? You already bought the domain. Yes,  I know you can cancel the purchase if you want. But that's not the point. GoDaddy should tell their customers that the access they're getting IS a trial and they'll have to SPEND more money to MAINTAIN their website. There is NO promotion to this, there is NO advantage to this. All you have is a trial period to build your website and once that's gone and you need to maintain it, you'll have to pay for it. Again, this is NOT a complaint about the technicalities of the tool. this is a complaint about how this is worded to lure customers into thinking that GoDaddy is going above and beyond the competition giving a toolset to customers that other companies don't. which is clearly not the case.",US

HOWEVER, post COVID true service has left and the days of ""The Customer is Always Right"" have left. In-fact, last week I waited on the phone to speak to a customer service person regarding a tech challenge that was causing my website to fail and labeling it as an UNSAFE WEBSITE. I was concerned and willing to wait the 90 minutes it took to hear a human voice. The person answering seemed nice and listened for a very short time and said:  ""I will be right back."" I was placed on hold. I waited for another 90 minutes. Then, YEP, disconnected!  SDF! It is challenging to find that kind of time, however important, especially when the challenge is not resolved. Today I had time and called GoDaddy. Mr Highland answered my call. He allowed me, an unskilled computer user that knows what I want and ZERO idea of the words to use or the understanding to completely explain my challenge. He listened, repeated, listened and then explained the challenge. He helped me with the google reseller account. (such a complicated situation) He changed the settings on the GoDaddy side and then helped me with getting the right information in the right location. He then helped me with another GoDaddy account providing my Customer number and how to find my PIN. I was so happy at the end of our time, nearly 90 minutes, I find myself glad the first person made me wait for 90 minutes just so I could speak to Mr, Highland. Almost..  A BIG Thank you to Mr. B Highland!! GREAT JOB",US

I searched for a domain to see if it was available at the official UK registrar Nominet The domain I wanted was available So assumed I could buy it for less than £10. Off I went to GoDaddy to purchase this domain as I use them to manage and host a few small websites. Searching for it on GoDaddy and it says the domain is unavailable. However GoDaddy informed me that they could obtain the domain for me using their ""Broker Service"" for just £51.99. But I knew the domain was available, so I went to another registrar and bought it for £5. Wow GoDaddy, want a 1000% markup on that domain!! So either  1) GoDaddy's system to check domain availability is fundamentally flawed and returns incorrect results. or 2) They are deceitfully showing domains as registered to get the £50+ fee.....

Finaly, I canceled all subscriptions and moved websites to another hosting provider where I was helped in minutes and did not have to pay anything extra.

I understand the need to protect against such cyber security issues, but to do so in this way, with no more than 24 hours' notice over a holiday period is poor. A better way would be to redirect the A record in question to a parking page until the issue can be resolved which would avoid the propagation time and give the customer an opportunity to self-manage the issue. We have a large number of customers all around the world who are currently denied services. Lack of appreciation for this fact shows very little empathy for the challenging commercial climate all customers currently operate under. More of an effort should have been made to contact the customer about the matter and a faster process to unsuspend the domain is needed given the time it takes to re-propagate the DNS rules.

The entire site crashed and was down for a week. I lost $1,000s in revenue. This happened in November. 2. They were supposed to have done that move in March 2022 when I renewed. I found this out when I called mid november becasue I drop down menu they fixed stopped working. The customer service rep told me that there was a mistake and I should have been moved over. She said that I would have to revert back to the March site (why I do not understand). I agreed, I just wanted it fixed.  From there, it was a nightmare and then entire site crashed and when fixed I had to manually redo the edits I had done since march. 3. I had a clone site on c Panel (as recent as November) and thought I could use that to get back the edits and copy and paste. Well, that clone, I was informed, had been compromised and did not work anymore..... 4. My theme is outdated so I need a new one. When I tried to do a staging site, GoDaddy had never deleted an old url and the site keeps redirecting to it. Still waiting for this to be fixed 5. You are at the mercy of the rep. They always, no matter what, route you to the salespeople. If they cannot sell you anything, you get transferred. Then, more than likely, that person is wrong and you get transferred again. 6. My average call time with them is 1 hour or more. Since these issues in November, I have spent nearly 10 HOURS talking to someone and being on hold.  Here I am, over a month in the half making with lost revenue and time and still no solution.",US

So having 100’s of domain names over the years I understand the process, I have all my domains on auto renewal and any domains I do not want auto renewal on I switch off, yet still get email after email informing me the domain is about to expire etc.  That is until you have a domain that you purchase for over $4000. I ended up not using the domain and putting it for sale in their platform. I then get a representative contact me saying they have an offer for the domain which I accept, 3 days later the domain is removed from my account of which I thought nothing of as a price has been agreed. I was informed the money would be in my account within 7 days. After waiting 4 weeks and after having numerous conversations with the broker that sold it, informing me his support team were trying to reach me to ask me to transfer the domain (did not receive one call or email from them) I then chase again to be informed that the domain had expired days before the broker contacted me asking if I want to sell it! i did not receive ONE email from them stating the domain was due to expire and to top it all off it was on AUTO RENEWAL.  So they have just stolen my domain and sold it, I have the emails to prove it, I have emails stating they had received funds and would send to me 7 days after the domain had been transferred!  Absolute scam of a company, there are many places to buy domains so I would suggest dealing with a company that will not steal your domain and sell it behind your back. They have zero support either so trying to get hold of them is almost impossible.",GB

806,www.godaddy.com,2023-01-03T18:06:36.000Z,5,Bittersweet best describes GoDaddy,"A 5 star feedback but marred by a very disappointing 'pricing' experience to renew a domain name, that which I registered with GD in 2020. The 5 star feedback is specifically for the customer service staff at GD, particularly two key representatives who I engaged with via telephone. Gianira, the first and subsequently Ron. Absolutely excellent contact with these two fine people and easily contacted without delay or issue. Gianira especially called me back on numerous occasions to help sort things out....now the bad news...having registered a new domain name for my existing business, I paid a nominal first year registration fee. Having faith and trust in GD, I left the option for 'auto renewal' on. A year after I was horrified to see a registration renewal fee had been taken for £180. Immediately contacted GD, inform that my chosen domain was a 'high level' one, attracting the rather expensive renewal cost. News to me! I was advised to call up GD, a week or so prior to the next year renewal, to discuss the cost and pretty sure an arrangement could be made. Year two, I did just that and despite every effort made by Gianira and her 'so called' Supervisors, no reduction whatsoever was offered on the £150 + VAT, not a single penny. Frustrated and disappointed by this, I scoured the market for competitive renewal quotes and lo and behold, 123-reg renewed the domain name, for one year at the miserly fee of £22.99 + vat. What A Difference! In conclusion...Go Daddy...you have the ABSOLUTE BEST Customer Service Staff ANY company could wish for... but you seriously need to review AND amend certain Domain Registration renewal fees, otherwise you'll lose clients such as I, once we realise how we're being conned and lied to. It is ONLY due to the efforts, honesty, understanding and integrity, of Gianira and Ron, at GD, that I will remain as a customer for hosting/e-mail, otherwise, I'd not hesitate to offer my business elsewhere.  G.D.... Got to Do better!",GB

820,www.godaddy.com,2023-01-03T13:45:15.000Z,3,Extremely Overpriced,"GoDaddy charges £74.99 for SSL certificates which you can get for free with Let's Encrypt. They do not add anything of value compared to Let's Encrypt certificates (which some hosting companies offer completely for free, including automatic renewal). On top of that, GoDaddy won't let me revoke a certificate after I canceled the product (even though I still have the certificate, full certificate chain, and private key). Customer support is OK over the phone, although they don't always answer during opening hours. Apart from that, there are no other channels. No email support, no ticket system, no live chat -- yes, GoDaddy advertises 24/7 live chat but IT DOES NOT WORK. I have tried multiple times with the latest Safari (v16) and Firefox (v108) over the past 6 weeks and the chat just won't load. This isn't ""world class"" or ""award winning"" customer support by any stretch of the imagination! GoDaddy's account centre / control panel where you manage your products is also slow and clunky. And GoDaddy upsells you expensive addons like ""Website Security Basic"" and ""Ultimate Domain Protection"" when you buy domain names. Again, some of the benefits included are offered free with other providers. I know this because I had a family member buy a domain name, who isn't tech savvy (that was a mistake!). He ended up paying £££'s for addons which were never used (particularly ""Website Security Basic"" which requires a setup procedure) before I helped him transfer to another registrar. Oh and their .com domain names are more than twice as expensive to boot as when you buy from other registrars! In conclusion, GoDaddy is overpriced and difficult to reach for support. That said, THEIR CORE SERVICES DO WORK RELIABLY and they offer a decent amount of options for them, so GoDaddy could be a good choice for the rich & technically inept. However, for personal and small businesses, I see no reason to choose GoDaddy for domains or SSL over better (less well known) alternatives.",GB

Thanks for the reply Go Daddy but you haven’t contacted me to try and resolve this. So I will explain here: The first scam was to put the website up on auction, you have to sign up to a subscription to even bid on it which costs £20 a month (I claimed it back from PayPal) at which point Go Daddy had automatically put in a bid at the same time they secured the .co.uk equivalent name so I couldn’t switch. they must write In algorithms to bid you up to there valuation, in my case was £780 for an obscure name. Then they offer a service to buy back the site from the new owner which is of course go Daddy, that will cost £51.99 they call it a broker service fee. All this money going out and you still haven’t got your own web address back. Even if you pay all this money you don’t know how much there going to charge you and to top it off there will be a 20% commission . it’s disgusting!",GB

As I was not planning to stay with GoDaddy I didn’t update the info.  Today I received notification that a 2 year renewal for >$200 had been processed, when they never had the updated cc info.    I called and got them to refund the charge but what a POOR business practice. Added after Reply below from GoDaddy Tom - thank you for the info.  If I had known that I would have called to cancel.  Instead I received the following email from GoDaddy, which certainly implies the account will NOT continue without updating my info. Your payment method isn't valid. Maybe your payment info isn't complete or your card expired. Whatever the reason, sign in to your account and take care of this today.

I've never had issues with them (besides their ridiculous high prices) until recently. 4 days ago, I received an email from GoDaddy with a request to remove a single page on my website within 24 hours (insanely short timeframe for a page on an inactive domain/website) since it ""violates their TOS"". I did not read the email on time and my account got suspended. I contacted support, explained my store, the friendly lady on the phone gave me temporary access to my cPanel again to delete the single page that is against the TOS. (Not adult, no DMCA content, nothing weird, just a simple registration page) After deleting the page, I noticed the domain (worth about 1.500 USD) was deleted entirely from my account/possession. The friendly lady on the phone went after the issue & informed me after about an hour of calling that I had to send an email because this matter was beyond her control. After sending an email, i received a reply from GoDaddy's ""Digital Crime Unit"" informing me my service is suspended and I will not regain possession of my expensive domain name without any elaboration why. (a.k.a my domain is stolen by GoDaddy) Their email:  ""Hello, The referenced product has been permanently closed. The product will be made unavailable permanently. Our decision is based on our compliance requirements and internal policies, which direct that permanently closed products are not eligible for reinstatement, and is not intended as an accusation or derogatory claim. Regards, Digital Crimes Unit"" When asking for elaboration, I receive the same email over & over.  Shortly summarized: Amazing white collar scam GoDaddy.

The only improvement to the phone assistance, would be eliminating the digital assistant and replacing them with real people. Psychologically, when a person has a problem with a product, digital operators increase the frustration and anger. Having been a phone receptionist, a live person can dilute an angry caller by simply stating a long greeting. Example: “Hello, GoDaddy.com. This is “name of operator” How may I direct your call?” A long greeting deflates their intense emotion. People upset are ready with a challenging attitude. Waiting through a digital voice, and menus, intensifies the anger into a verbal abuse mode. Something to consider for the betterment of customer experience. It could also be a selling point for your products. People would choose GoDaddy products first, for banning digital operators.",US

I have my domain registered with Godaddy and use 2 Unlimited Business Email plans in Workspace email since quite a few years. Last year, I paid for the renewal of my email plans for 2 years, not knowing that they are going to phase out the product. So, 1. I should have received an email about it 2. They sent us an email saying we will be 'auto-migrated' to the new Microsoft 365 email plan soon. 3. This did not happen till Dec, 2022, and during every followup we were told 'it would happen soon'. #Falsepromises 4. During this period from April 2022- Dec 2022, we faced A LOT of issues with Workspace Webmail. For each and every unique problem, the only thing the Guides would tell us after their SOPs (change password, use incognito mode) was that the problem is at our end. REALLY? All my other emails (Gmail, Ymail etc) and websites etc. work fine, only Godaddy is the issue, but yes I should change my Internet provider. Right. 5. In Dec 2022, this started impacting my business badly. It is our busy season, and we cannot login to our mails, there are issues with sending/receiving, and the Guides tell me. that Workspace is at End of life so they cannot help. 6. So I suggested that they give me credits for the unused amount on my already paid email plan, which I can use to upgrade to Microsoft plans. They refused. I asked for help to backup my webmail to whichever other provider I choose. They refused. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I dont know which award they won for customer service, but the ""talk to our award winning guides"" ad is not genuine.",IN

I got an email saying that my products would get renewed and I needed to update my payment method.  I contacted them because I needed help updating my payment methods (and I want the service to continue). While speaking with them, I connected to Alekhya Y. I asked this person if I renew it for longer, I could get discounts, and the madness started.  1. Alekhya said yes, and sent me an offer to renew it for three years (with no discount). I said to Alekhya that there was no discount, and it was impossible for Alekhya to understand that the price was the same as renewing it every year (Alekhya kept saying that there was a discount - granted as a loyal customer - but there was none) 2. in the meantime, I saw that my plan was called Microsoft 365, so I asked if I had access to it. Alekhya said I had, but I tried downloading it but couldn't without upgrading. 3. Alekhya sent me a link that I used to select another email plan (with a discount!), but that meant doing a backup and having a new email.  I kindly asked Alekhya to pass me on to someone else; it was getting messy. Alekhya ignored my ask three times, trying to ""solve"" the confusion. I finally got passed to Varun K (a supervisor), to whom I complained about Alekhya and his answer was: ""Yeah, I'm reviewing the conversation."" After the answer, I asked: Do I have a Microsoft package? Alekhya said I had; he said, ""It is active,"" and suddenly, Alekhya was back answering the questions. I asked Alekhya what had happened to Varun? That I need to speak with someone else. Alekhya connected me back to.. guess who? VARUN! I asked Varun why he left, and he was, ""Was facing some issues."" and with the worst attitude on the planet. I asked him why Alekhya and himself were saying I have a Microsoft package. His answer was: ""was referring to email essential plan.."" which was not my question! I started the chat at 10:34 am, it is 1:26 pm, and I am still trying to figure out a way to complain about Varun. Because I asked him to whom I could complain about him, and his answer was: ""I think there was a misunderstanding"" This is a joke; please, someone from GoDaddy contact me. I am more than happy to send you the whole conversation for you to see the poor service that both Alekhya Y and Varun K deliver.",GB

They offered me discount on future renewals but this was useless to me as I had only just purchased the hosting so I was at least a year away from renewal.

I have never had an issue with their customer support or anything up until a few years ago. I noticed that they no longer have US side support and from then every time I called things were not always as easy to get help as it had been.  I have been trying to get support help for the last 4 days to fix the server access that has redirected my website domain to a porn site. This is causing me several thousands of dollars of lost work and possibly future clients and damages.  I have spoken with managers Dj and John Jorden and both were not able to get it fixed. This has happened repetitively over the last 4 days and I have several videos showing proof of the issue that I have shared with the IT support teams. Nothing has been done to fix it. Tickets are opened but nothing has been done. I have been told to reply with more information but there is no way to do this. I will add more information to my review.  It has now been almost a week that every website on my GoDaddy server is getting redirected to a porn website. Today at times it only redirects to porn other times to a fake site for windows defender.  I have now spent over 8 hours on hold in the last week and spoken with Dustin, John Jordan, DJ, David, and Claudia.  At this time it has been confirmed that it has nothing to do with the code on my website and is a known problem with GoDaddy servers also. I have video proof in a sharable one drive folder for anyone that wants it.   Ticket ID: 16711448763924 Ticket ID: 16711446153229 As of today, this will most likely cost me several thousand dollars in lost income, time, and credibility. Updated 1/10/23 So after almost 2 weeks of my websites getting redirected to porn sites GoDaddy finally fixed the issue with the server redirect. I was also told that my code had nothing to do with it and it was handled with GoDaddy on the whole shared server. No apology no discount for the 2 weeks I had clients and contract offers redirecting to porn destroying my reputation. Just closed out the tickets and that's it. I have to wonder if I didn't spend almost 30 hours on the phone for that 2 weeks if they would have ever fixed it? I am very disappointed in the way this issue was handled.",US

The phonecall was over an hour long and a lot of information was passed to me and I would like to say if it wasn't for this individual Alex you wouldn't have me as a customer, but lucky for godaddy you do because I have continued using godaddy services and I feel  like a massive weight has been lifted from my shoulders. I cannot thank Alex enough for all the information and help he provided me, not only that I was able to ask Alex about other services I had seen on godaddy but as there isn't enough information on the godaddy website to make an actual decision about those services speaking with Alex he told me in-depth about the services and resolved any concerns or questions I had. This person is an asset to godaddy and I hope that this review gives him some sort of recognition for being such a wonderful and polite person and also an exceptional employee of godaddy.

She tried, but it was just beyond her capabilities.  Thankfully she was kind enough to transfer me to Maryannee.  I am so thankful I persisted and asked to speak to someone in a more advanced position because once I got on the phone with Maryannee, she really STUCK with me, DUG into the issue and helped me by finding the error in the code.  Where others would have long since given up, she DIDN'T.  She also walked me through HOW she found the issue, and how to resolve it.  Even taught me how to use some of the tools at my disposal with godaddy, which I hadn't used before.  She really went above and beyond, putting her talent and knowledge to work for me. Help like this is so impossible to find anymore, someone who CARES and is WILLING to put the extra effort in.  I can't tell you how much it means to me that she did.

He told me he would waive the first month and the hold on so he can get me up and running. He put me on hold and came back to the phone and said I had to pay $60 to get my website up and running . Why would I have to pay $60 for a website that was not up and running at all they’re charging me for a month that I didn’t have my website. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, the supervisor told me that they had sent an email and demanded me to change my current email. I told him the last email I received then he stated he can waive the $60 fee for reactivation of my website but I’ll have to pay the first month for the website that I never had for a month.

Today I called to try and see if there's a way I can get the money refunded because I am tight for it in this economy and difficult times.

Please do not tell a customer “your wait time is 8 minutes” which evolves into 20 plus minutes.

They emailed me and said my card declined (thank goodness) when they tried to charge me $191 for my basic website even though (as I was told by their representative that the basic plan is $143.  I told them I have never been charged that amount of money and I said no to the charge.  Then I see a charge for $263 for a premium website! I never wanted their premium service. Have never had their premium service. I don't need their premium service. I have tried on numerous occasions to get my money back from them. First they said they would send me $120 back to equal the price of the basic service which the rep said was $143 (again, not $191). When that never happened I contacted them again. They said they gave me a store credit to which I said ABSOLUTELY NOT! Why would I want a credit for this lying, deceitful company. Then (in the same conversation) they said they were trying to refund the money to my bank but the bank was refusing it. (Another lie). I called my bank when I was on the chat with Godaddy. The bank has never seen any transactions coming in from them. Then they said they would ""mail me a check"". Seriously!! I am going to cancel my service as soon as I can and I hope enough people read this to make a difference in the way this company conducts business. It's appalling. Retraction issued on 12/16/2022-Since this review has been written, I heard from the manager of online reviews. He asked me to reach out to him so we communicate on this issue directly. Based on the information I provided he refunded the entire $263 (I only asked for $120 which would have made the price correct for the Basic Plan). He also renewed my account for one year.  GoDaddy stepped up to the plate and did the right thing so I will retract my previous review. I will say one thing. I hate writing bad reviews. You really have to push me to my limit to get me to write one. It would have been nice to be able to resolve this without going to this legnth.

Really??  This is NOT the kind of service I have come to expect from the last DECADES OF MY LOYAL PATRONAGE.  Whatever you're doing, it's a result of incredibly poor planning.  Even other than that, I'm not having a good day RE: godaddy: my ""notification"" of changes to the e-mail system consisted of me (a) not being able to access my email, (b) not being able to change the password, (c) discovering that you're trying to pawn me off on to Microsoft 365 (the entire principle of which I am opposed, AND I refuse to have anything to do with Outlook, because IT SUCKS), and (d? e? what letter am I up to now?) a 40-MINUTE WAIT for godaddy phone support? I need to get my e-mail access back (temporarily--because if today is any indication of godaddy's current direction, my next move--after MANY YEARS of being a GoDaddy customer, both personally and on behalf of my business--is to find another service provider).  :( :( :(  Please help me get access to my e-mail!!!!! very unhappily, -pt"" P.S. - After 40 minutes on hold (and about 20 minutes waiting for a chat response), I finally did get in touch with GoDaddy tech support.  They had, in fact, sent out e-mails warning us of an impending e-mail system change (which--for whatever reason--I hadn't seen), but that's really irrelevant (except that had I seen them, I would, in fact, have known that the change was going to occur).  And--as usual--when I did finally get in touch with someone, they (Kurt) were very competent and helpful.

Their willingness to educate me on domain name’s and then hosting my website which then evolved an online store. Before Covid my photography/film business was pumping and my clients, …biggest one being The Australian Defence Force (for over a decade too) had a secure and private website to purchase their images, footage and interviews from. I am now a proud Grandma and i’m side stepping for a bit. I told GoDaddy what I want, ..it was a product they do not provide (hopefully in future they will). The young man jumped online and guided me to where I can find out more about what I am after. As always I got off the phone satisfied and smiling. Sincerely  Jacqueline :)",AU
2253,www.godaddy.com,2022-12-30T22:00:05.000Z,2,'Sold' what I didn't want. Management refused to cancel order or credit account.,"I called GoDaddy to discuss moving my email hosting. I described my company and how we use all Google tools including Google business email, Chrome, Google Pixel phones, etc. I mentioned that my goal was to avoid Microsoft products. The sales person told me how great they are and sounded smart. I bought the package they suggested and moved my domain from Wix. After the transfer, it turns out that Microsoft is the service GoDaddy sells; the salesperson simply didn't mention it. There was an hour wait when I called during business hours, so I used chat and got a manager, Kawalpreet K. He said there was nothing he could do. He could not even credit the account the $140 for getting me into this mess. The salesperson, Rick, didn't return my emails. My domain is locked at GoDaddy for 60 days and then I have to move it back and pay a fee for doing so. I'm glad to know how they operate. I thought they had good service, like Amazon for example, but I was wrong. They will tell you what you want to hear to get the sale and then try to get you to stay with them or keep your money if you got tricked into the wrong package or product. They could do better by not selling a service they know the prospect doesn't want or need. They could do better by taking responsibility and acting ethically.  It's unfortunate that the company cares more about tricking someone out of $140 than their long term reputation.

2270,www.godaddy.com,2022-12-15T22:06:46.000Z,2,GoDaddy service deteriorates significantly,"I am a long time customer of GoDaddy (more than 20 years). Service had always been great until 3 months ago when I noticed a suspicious charge notification email from GoDaddy. I tried to login to see what the charge was all about. But I can't. The 2-step authentication said it sent me the code, but didn't. I can receive text from other service providers such as Google and all my friends. I am now locked out of my account for 3 months. The support call wait queue is averaged now at 20+ minutes. I called in, after listening music for almost half an hour, the support person told me that they were experiencing texting service issues these days. The support person can't even tell me anything about the charge since he cannot authenticate me (hello, I am calling from the phone # on file!!).  The only thing I can do is to remove the 2-step authentication. In order to do that, I must follow a link to upload a copy of my driver license, so I did. About more than a week later, I received an email asking me to email the copy of my driver license, so I did. Today, after a month later after that, I have not heard anything back from GoDaddy. I am wondering what is going on there. I am now at a cross point of moving away from GoDaddy to somewhere else. I will update later when I have a resolution. UPDATED on 12/14/2022 - I finally received an email yesterday with a link to reset my password and was able to login back in to my account. I was not able to login to my account for a month. Luckily I did not have any deadline to deal with during that time. But I was really worried. I am still wondering why can't GoDaddy use my registered email address as identity verification. Instead, they had me go through three rounds of driver license upload, the last round had to be my face along with driver license. I felt like a prisoner checking in to prison:( 12/15/2022: Response to GoDaddy's response - I appreciate your feedback and you are serious about protecting my privacy and confidentiality of my account for which I just upgraded one star to two. But I have an email address on file, can't your system simply send me a verification code by my email for which I have used for more than 20 years!!",US

I've been waiting for a refund since 23 November, today is 2 December, because they sold me a wrong product. I spent hours on the chat and I called them. In the end, the only solution so far is pay me back with store credits. I'm moving all my products and my website to a different provider because of their sh.tty service and I'm not interested in store credits. And the reason they can't pay me back is super stupid. I've paid via Ideal, so used my bank account but when it comes to refund, Ideal is not an option. I made the payment via my business bank account and also accepted to get paid on my personal credit card but here's the trick: they can't! Because it's not the same payment method I've used during the payment. They are still ""investigating"" even the maximum time for a reply is 72 hours. They don't reply my emails, they simply avoid me. They simply lost min 150 Eur per year on my products and still trying my patience.

We tried to upload the ID but the site would not allow us.  Called Support and sent ID by email and two days later the cert still said validation pending.  Support said allow 24 hours.  Called back a day later, they said wait 20 minutes.  An hour later still pending.  A week of going around in circle I called SSL support and got a guy named Alan.  This guy not only didn't help but was the most condescending technician I've ever talked to.  Told me I wasn't being truthful. Rude, and mainly talked about how he had been a developer for 13 years, eluding that he knew most everything about web dev and he'd never seen a problem like this before.  Finally, I just told them to cancel and refund my money.  I went to SSL Trust, purchased, and validated through Cname in only 30 minutes.

It is a LOOP, a TRAP I say. once you start subscription. so BEWARE , to say NO to GoDaddy.   just cause they get a Capt.Dhoni and other celebs to advertise with some cools ads mean they have the visibility but they are terrible Web Host and their customer service simply sucks...even in the most polite conversation with the call centre executive online, they leave the chat abruptly and the system sends another executive and they have a patent dialogue, ""SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE, we are here to help you ."" and then with good faith I start again explaining my plight and after a 8-10 mins he/she is also gone in thin air, just disappear and this goes on forever more... here is a case in point they have been hosting me for over 9 years...They lure people on with their fancy offers and once you are sucked into the trap next year onwards they renewals plans etc. takes the pulp out of you when there are cheaper and better options out there but you are compelled to pay up the extra sum for the sake of peace of mind. and linger on with GoDaddy for another year and then another year and you are simply stuck in a loop, a TRAP.  Then you wish to migrate the domain and go with another web host like Hostinger or SiteGround etc.  but you can not move your domain even after your domain is expired.  it is expired means it is available for the public to buy the domain if they wish to, anybody can but nah GoDaddy will park the domain with them for a period of 1 year , in short you can not migrate to any one else as the domain is still with GoDaddy post the expiry of the domain.  can you believe the scam, in short we are stuck with GoDaddy yet again, helplessly, they say it is with the domain Registry and guess what when you further probe on the 'Registry' and look deeper and further by visiting the webwhois.verisign to check who is the domain registry with , and am told the domain Registry is with GoDaddy but they encroach on your property to blackmail you further as you have no choice but to continue to RENEW with them, but they weird part is that they blame the 'registry' and we get fooled. and when probed further you realise every web-hosting company has their own registry and so GoDaddy keeps your domain and refuses to release it to us (post expiry) so they in short know that you will give them any bucks to retain your domain by paying the extra bucks. or it could go to someone else. cheap tacts right ? 'all in the name of safety', hahaaaa...bloody hell.  super unethical and unprofessional people do everything in their capacity to paralyse you.  so you are compelled to give into their soft demands.  Then they tell me it is taken by some other customer, imagine in a span of 1 hour they changed the story thrice and now they tell me it is bought by some Domain Agent -  and his commission to release the space is 5328/- for one year, this is  including his commission, can you imagine the layer of stories and the tricks they play to keep the customer with them by hook or crook.  and to my utter dismay I learned the Domain agent is also one of them. I mean internal team / department that blocks the expired website in order to make the client desperate to pay the additional price to keep their business and domain intact.  this is the next level of strategies they apply and do we have a choice , actually not right ?  well almost everybody will give in but I chose to lose and negotiate with another domain after much tryst.  but the long and short of it that they do everything they can in their capacity to keep the client hooked to them and even if that means they have to sell their soul , they will do that as well. and sure they have done the same in my case. shoddy immoral practices.  Karma is for real and that day is not far. when they pay the price.",IN

I hope we all keep complaining if we want it to change. Thank you Jo at GD and thank you TrustPilot for being an outlet for us. In 2020 my webmaster and I transferred hosting to Go Daddy because I was quoted a rate by ""Chris"" we were told would be honored at our 2-year renewal. Anytime you start anything with Go Daddy they activate auto-renewal ""saying"" you can shut that off at anytime & to that I say lolol. A month before hosting would auto renew the emails all caps began saying I will loose my website/URGENT/ and one of the worst GD scams where they say they tried (why I don't know) to charge my cc and its not valid or expired so ""HURRY before its too late!"" They kept sending those emails about a hosting due to renew in 6 weeks. I don't even THINK they said it was for ""hosting."" They just scare the hell out of you with repeated high drama, red letters, all caps, & bolded letters. BUT never include facts or info: not including their email is about a domain or hosting and I guess...if hosting ends your domain name is at risk? That was insinuated in their latest email saying I could LOOSE my website. 6wks of GD emails while I am checking MY responsible adult notes and ical alerts that warn me 2WKS before (due to GD tactics TO freak out customers & they literally do NOT care lol) and being it is now an appropriate week away from being due & the close of my first 2yrs I wanted to check they'd honor their quote. I am a novice & DG obviously created their company modo's for people like me. I looked an hour and could not find the amount of money they were planning on charging me to renew. If I ""fixed my cc on file"" first GD would just charge the amount they want! I still didn't know why GD ""tried to charge my cc"" or what could be wrong with my cc they just charged in July? FYI- my bank said GD did not attempt a charge recently(lol). After 40 mins waiting on a text w/ GD who say it's ""quick"" I gave up and actually didn't sit on hold on the phone very long at all! I spoke to Stella #4675 at GD who confirmed a few key things: 1. until you ""check""off the product to renew and click ""add to cart you can not see what GD will charge you lol. 2. conveniently because, & someone is super slimy to come up with these MANY small, seemingly little hiccups meant to pursued us to give up and be deflated, you can NOT ""add a product to the cart"" from a mobile device lol. So, they keep bringing you back to ""update your cc"" hoping you'll give up and update your card so they can charge you. For many who only have smart phones, you're screwed. That moment I only had my phone so Stella added it to my cart for me and instructed I would now be able to see GD's price to renew.wow. 3. GD had ZERO intentions of keeping their word (yes I know, stupid me) and they would have charged me TRIPLE their quote - without notice, without informing me of the increase in black and white- without anything BUT the fear based emails, the warnings I'll loose everything because my cc is not working. GD do not email customers FACTS like your REAL renewal date or the cc on file w/ the last four digits in order to push you to their site. Those many emails ALSO do NOT include THE COST of your renewal or if its 1 or 2-yrs. They do NOT give customers options on their website from within your account to assign & agree how far ahead we would like to receive their threats of fear aka ""reminder emails."" If fixing this were real for GD THAT would solve complaints I'm reading online. That's as far as I'll take my 1,2,3 but if you've dealt with GD you're aware it goes up to 11. I also found that SSL alert in C-Panel many others complain about where they say it's been self assigned and something went wrong and then the UPGRADE button is mysteriously more visible. For a novice it looks as if your websites not working since ""January 2022"" (suddenly GD had no need to send email warnings?) Forgetting THAT for now, I need to SHUT OFF AUTO RENEW. There are a ton of areas on GD.com where you CAN'T shut off auto-renew, and apparently ONE where you can, or can't you? On a computer & the product checked I click on ""auto renew ON"" because no icon says either ""auto renew OFF"" or simply ""auto renew."" The ONLY other option is carefully titled ""Cancel Renewal"" lol no joke, so everyones naturally freaked out but you click & it brings up a warning box you're about to cancel your service! Do I click THAT to STOP auto-renew? How do I actually shut off auto-renew for domains and hosting?? HELP - with GD I am a deer in the woods about to be shot at all times!! Where else can I take my business where its not so slimy?",US

2801,www.godaddy.com,2022-11-29T22:27:19.000Z,1,I used godaddy to make my own web page…,"I used godaddy to make my own web page for a business I'm trying to start up. I designed my own page, as like anyone, I wanted my exact choice of layout and content. It took some time to do, which one reason was because I was only allowed to upload pictures of 30mb or belown, and the files I needed to upload from my stockers sites were larger than 30mb, therefore they could not be up loaded. So it was a long process for me of screen shot, copy, paste for upload. The time scale was nearly a month to produce my still not finished website, and when the trial design expired, godaddy then prompt either buy to continue the site build or basically scrap it all and start again. I called godaddy to discuss what happens once I buy it ect and was explained by the gentleman on the line what the cost was covering and he did say that I could activate it whilst working on it still, and once I was ready to buy the page, to email him and he would see about discount for a new customer. So a week or so after the call, I emailed the man to say I'm ready to proceed. I heard nothing back over a long period of time, so thought I'll call again and see whats happening? I spoke to a differnet person this time, and 1st I asked why I can't find my designed page any longer? After some searching, he came back to say that the page had been permanently deleted. I could not believe all my time and effort had been for nothing and my business website further delayed. I asked why it was deleted, he replied that after a certain time of the trial ending, if not purchased, deletion. I was not told this by the previous member of staff. I was then offered to have the page built for me and that a builder would contact me and go through the creation and then once built I could view the site and once happy purchase it. I was told 10 days or less to build it and also offered a discount from £240 down to £200. All of this seemed like the best possible rectification for having deleted my own made site due to miss communication. Once again I was asked to email when I had all my pictures and info ready, and then once I email, a web builder will then be in contact. nearly 2 weeks and 2 emails later, yet again I hear nothing and have to call. This time I spoke with a lady, who was very polite, but after much explaining and going over the same thing she finally understood why I was calling and on numerous occasions put me on hold to go off and find things out and or ask, I assume, what she needs to do with my particular call as it took an hour just in the end to ask a couple of questions about what I wanted on my site, and the cost, which was either £167 incl vat or £167 plus vat, this was not really cleared up. But the cost was not my concern at this point, andI was still prepared to pay in full, but I was not expected after all the aboves events, to then be asked to pay in full for my page to be designed. I refused to pay and said that the page needs to be designed 1st before I pay anything, especially as I had been so messed about already, the least that could be done by godaddy is design 1st and take payment after. The lady said her hands were tied and despite my asking for a manager to make the decision, this to was not attempted and the call ended with me saying if no one can over rule me having to pay upfront then I won't bother with the site at all. No trying to keep my custom, or want to make right the 2 members of staff not replying to a customerthat they said they would. I had to call and chase,and lets not forget my page being deleted because their member of staff didn't explain things properly. instead months of my time wasted and not a sorry or rectification in sight.  If it were my company that put a customer through all of this, I would make sure everything was put right, and the customer well looked after. Notexpect them to pay in advance, when the free service has failed so bad.  Who would pay upfront for a website to be made after my experience?",GB

GD's inventory import/export feature has major bugs which technical support admit but show no interest in fixing. They shut me down and refused to discuss it further when I had clear evidence of issues. Beyond this there is just no general advancement on fixing re-launch gremlins (e.g from poor initial coding) and there is clearly no money being invested in upgrading the feature set. Took me approx. 3 days to rip out GD shopping cart and move to Square and relaunch my site.  As for Square their developers are clearly in a different league to GD's and have so many answers designed in where GD do not. So happy I moved, have gained so much more richer functionality.

I could not determine what happened, but only that there was still 25GB of data usage showing for my site which was hosting multiple domains. Finally, after being on the phone and chat sessions for 6 hours today, I was able, this evening, to speak with Jose Lorenzo at GoDaddy about the problem, and he was able to resolve the issue in less than eight minutes. He found that my public_html folder had somehow been moved into my SSL folder. Jose's brilliance and gift for troubleshooting the problem was so greatly impressive and appreciated. His reassurance and kindly disposition makes him exceptional in light of the fact that I have multiple companies hosted on my server, and I was going to be facing the alligators if all of these were found to be not working in the morning. Nevertheless, I can now get a few hours of sleep, and at sunrise my colleagues will not know of the great disappearance event. But, thank you and God bless you Jose Lorenzo at GoDaddy Hosting Support for resolving my issue. In summary, I learned from Jose that if your site statistics show 25GB of data usage, and you don’t have a public_html folder showing, or the one you have is empty, look for your files under another folder, as was my case, the SSL folder. How did my folder get moved? I do not know, unless by hand twitch or computer glitch it was dragged down without my awareness of the move. But, it was found and restored to its appropriate location by Jose and all is well.",US

The first experience with customer support was terrible, but Jaq's support more than made up for everything. I'm happy with the resolution of the full refund and impressed at how swiftly Jaq dealt with everything internally as well. Admittedly it shouldn't have had to come to this, but no company is perfect and what really matters is how a company resolves things when everything doesn't go smoothly. Jaq is an asset to GoDaddy and has made up for the first experience. Thanks Jaq ------------------ Spoke to Nongam and Sagan on Live Chat and they are refusing to refund an auto renewal for an unused domain which was not authorised to be charged to my card, when I am cancelling well within my 14 day statutory right as a UK consumer. Their own contract states that as a UK consumer I have 14 days to cancel products and services ordered from GoDaddy, yet they are insisting that a refund is not possible.  As per the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013, clauses 29, 30, 31 and 32, they are currently breaking UK law by refusing to honour my statutory right to 14 day cancellation as a UK customer. Trustpilot, please investigate this, consumers need to be protected from this horrific level of illegal malpractice.  And if you're thinking of getting a domain from GoDaddy, stay WELL clear. They will keep your card details on file and extract money from you years down the line against your will, then refuse to pay it back when no services have been provided. Absolutely disgusting.",GB

There were a bunch of things my business needs and the purpose of my phone call was to only fulfill one of those needs.  However, through the nature discourse of Wayne and I’d conversation, we were able to check off every item on my to do list simply by allowing the conversation to flow in a natural direction through listening, professionalism, product knowledge, customer familiarity and engagement.

I managed to pay an extension, while reimbursement was a pain because: 1. Whatsapp Agent said that it was not possible to get reimbursement for plans which were renewed, 2. Whatsapp Agent was not able to find the order number for the licenses I claimed, 3. Whatsapp Agent managed to find only 2 of 5 email plans and not the rest, neither did her Team leader,  3. The team lead took over not even introducing himsel, but referring to the policy, rather then helping to identify the order numbers, ... all in all two hours of chatting and nothing at the end.

Thank you Jezrell <3,"Anything to do with computers can be insanely frustrating... its usually user error... we don't quite know what we're doing, we aren't professionals, and we don't want to shell out the $$ to have someone else do what seems like a simple task for us. Then, we get annoyed. Customer service agents deal with cranky, frustrated, non-tech-savvy folks all day, and lets be honest, we aren't always polite.. by the time we get to the point where we need to call for help, we're usually not in the best mood.  Twice now, I've needed to call an agent from GoDaddy and both occasions really blew my socks off. Such wonderful client care, patience, I wound up laughing and smiling, instead of throwing my laptop off of my balcony... which was a real possibility. I don't know much about the company, the website templates are very basic... it's not necessarily a high quality platform.. but the price is right, for a basic landing page, which is why I've used the service to set up basic websites for a couple of friends. Honestly though, I know that when i run into an issue, I'm not going to end up pulling my hair out over tech support, because the service is UNREAL. Today I dealt with ""Jezrell"".. and I really wish I could recall the last agents name because he was an ALLSTAR too. (Even down to getting my cell number and calling to check in on my site progress, and helping me get a great discount) I'm not one to write a review in most cases (too lazy).. but the customer service staff at GoDaddy truly deserve some acknowledgement.",CA

I sell nitesticks and they consider that a weapon.  You could go on line and buy a machete or a baseball bat which is definitely more of a weapon and there are NOT restrictions on those. They refunded all of my money except for the domain name which I'll use to create my own internet site thru Square.

We were asked by the “payment verification” team to upload ID, bank statements, and photos of our debit card to prove that it was us who made the £1 domain name payment. Did this, and were told everything was hunky dory. About 10 minutes later the site disappeared. To cut a long story short, it turns out they absolutely love clients who operate fraudulent websites (backhanders, anyone?), but are not so welcoming to clients whose purpose is to offer a fraud prevention service, as we do, Oh yes, forgot, they steal your domain name as well. Avoid these dirty scammers at all cost. UPDATE So these dirty scammers have now replied with their fits- all copy-and-paste replies asking for “further information”. Bottom line: if you did provide this “further information”, they won’t respond - AGAIN. Why? Because the only purpose of GoDaddy is to steal your domain and then sell it on the open market.  Oh yes, one more thing: after providing them with ID and debit card details as per their bogus  “payment verification” team, our credit card started lighting up all over the world like a Christmas tree. So they’re identity thieves as well UPDATE Nr 2 Just received a reply a reply from GoDaddy telling us to f.u.c.k off. UPDATE Nr 3 GoDaddy STOLE the domain name we paid for and has NO intention of either refunding us or allowing us to transfer it to another registrar. UPDATE Nr 4 Still no sign of our refund; in the meantime one or more employees of GoDaddy appear to have used our debit card to do their Christmas shopping UPDATE Nr 5 Still no reply received NOR a refund appearing in our bank account. Meanwhile, someone within GoDaddy U.K. used our debit card to do their Christmas shopping. Scandalous. UPDATE Nr 6 Fraudsters GoDaddy steal your domain name and identity. Stay well clear. UPDATE Nr 7 Despite the fake “copied-and-pasted” reply Godaddy send to all their scammed customers, not a single reply to our numerous emails has been received.  It’s safe to assume that every single 5 star review on this site has been purchased by these fraudster. No refund received to date for the domain they stole from us, and our debit card used by Godaddy to make their Christmas purchases. Disgusting dirty scammers.

3789,www.godaddy.com,2022-11-14T22:05:10.000Z,2,Godaddy has gotten worse over time,"Update:  I thought my comment was annonymous. But TrustPilot went ahead and shared my email address with Godaddy. I feel incredibly violated. Such a betrayal of trust. I wonder if TrustPilot is owned by Godaddy and not telling us. If that's the case, I would've never left a comment. And if it's not, it should inform us it shares our information and email address with Godaddy. Beware you commenters. We can't trust TrustPilot.  Now I have to worry about Godaddy terminating my account because I vented off and told a whole bunch of truth I knew they obviously wouldn't accept as truth and put out their own fake truth. I've been a customer of Godaddy for 21 years! YES. A LONG TWENTY ONE YEARS. That means I know what I'm talking about. It used to take only seconds, if not just minutes, to get someone on the phone. Plus, everyone was in the U.S. Now, 8 out of 10 times we're placed on hold with hold time over one hour no matter what time of the day or night we're calling, and then calls are routed to someone in the Philippines who can't even help us or maybe they can. So, getting service is a hit or miss.  I KNOW all that because I've been doing this for 21 years. You can't come tell us things are the same. That's just not true.  Godaddy deleted up to 100,000 of my emails, too, back in 2017. Those were emails from 2001-2011, spanning ten long years. They were ALL business emails. They said nothing to me until I found out accidentally two months later. I found out that happened to hundreds, if not thousands, of others too. I couldn't sue Godaddy because we have to show ""actual monetary damage."" That was a horrible and depressing experience. Terrible. Terrible. Horrible. Need I say more? It still makes me angry even thinking about it. Godaddy never made it up to me and never sent me one word of apology either. NONE. I had to find out on my own that the ""log files"" had been deleted, either intentionally or inadvertently, Who knows? Who's there to tell the truth? Something happened there. We don't know what, but we can guess. Regardless, I personally think it could've been ecause Godaddy wanted to save money on server expense. Is that true? I have no idea. Everything I say would be speculation. It could've been that their IT team we never have access to made a colossal mistake. But one thing is clear: Godaddy should've known it happened. And Godaddy doesn't EVER communicate with its customers about anything except just a handful of times all these years! That's nothing at all. If anything goes wrong, the Terms of the agreement says we are on our own.  One more thing happening in the past year: Godaddy intentionally changes the settings to ""auto renew."" it's done it twice without my permission. It takes a lot of work to undo it. That's just not right not matter what standard you're using. The choice should be ours.    Also, I know for a fact WorkSpace was far more superior to this ridiculous MS 365 email service and it was just as safe. So, please don't tell us MS365 is better. In fact, Microsoft doesn't provide phone suppoer any more. Shame on Bill Gates and Microsoft that with hundreds of billions of dollars in cash alone they have cut out all live services. And since Godaddy tells me I have to call Microsoft, that does nothing to help me and everything to anger us.  Really?! I guess we don't have brains! It's best for you to be honest about things and stop playing coporate games of telling us all that Godaddy does its best! If this is its best, though, obviously that's not good enough. Having said everything above. I appreciate any and all great service I do get when I do get it. I thought I have to be fair here.  Correction: I wrote erroneously that some of my emails hadn't been transferred. That was an error. Sorry about that. It is some of my email addresses that haven't been transferred. I know because they're not there. So, please don't come back telling me everything is OK.   Original Comment:  Godaddy has gotten worse over time. It retired its great email software ""WorkSpace"" and switched to Microsoft 365 Outlook telling everyone it's because of security holes. That's B.S. and false. MS 365 Outlook has issues. Not all my emails were transferred. Emails scheduled for future delivery don't have their own folder; they are kept inside ""Drafts"" folder, making it extremely difficult to find them, whereas WorkSpace had a folder designed for scheduled emails. Godaddy should have and could have improved the security of WorkSpace. It didn't have any security-related reasons to make the switch and put us through hell and start charging more money too.  Also, Godaddy has terminated a ton of its tech support staff and outsourced it to the Philippines just to save money. Nowadays, it could take more than one hour to get someone on the phone, that is if we are lucky. So, 8 out of 10 times that's what happens.",US

They both stayed with it over 3 hours to get it fixed! They were excellent and patient  We all exercised our best! While frustrated I relaxed and allowed them to do what they needed. They sought help, escalated it to a more advanced tech team because nothing seemed to work. They both kept me informed along the way, apologized for the wait and assured me they would get it fixed!!! 3 hours and 41 minutes later, I was back in business. They stayed on to make sure emails were back up and both sent test emails! Excellent! Godaddy but don’t make people wait to get an agent over an hour! I had to stay on because it affected my business but that is insane!  Thank your agents for having the best demeanor. I am a cool collected personality and gracious. So it was God’s divines. Otherwise it could have been a major  irritation.  Thank you Leslie and Shamandeep. Girls rock!  The 11/3 call with Herman was a wait 90 minutes. He was courteous and stayed on for over 90 minutes.

4221,www.godaddy.com,2022-11-13T08:51:15.000Z,1,Malicious business practices,"So three/four years back. I do not remember the time exactly, I wanted to get a .com domain of my name and wanted to host my blog. So I searched my name twice or thrice on GoDaddy and also looked for other options like hosting and all. I just completed my college and got into a low paying job so budget was an issue. I loved the prices listed on go Daddy. Now here comes a twist. While I was budgeting up to get a domain and hosting, I found out that the domain with my name is taken. Whois records tell it's booked by GoDaddy. The webpage it serves is a page of GoDaddy advertisement that says domain is available on GoDaddy for sale. I try to get it from them and it says it will require a brokerage fee for negotiation and post negotiation it will require buying cost additional. The brokerage cost was 60 times the cost they were listing the domain for and I do not want to think about how much they would have asked for domain itself. Now I added a Google Calendar entry to get my domain when it gets expired and I got a temporary domain for myself till that time. Next year searched the domain name once  again in their whois because the price they offer is is excellent. Atleast half, if not just 5% the cost told by other registrars. And within 24 hours the domain is booked for an year more. I searched and got to know that if the domain I wanted to get, gets a single ping they will try to hold it and try to bargain on their terms. So for next time I did a whois on ICANN official and it told me exact period the domain will be available. I waited for the period and grace period to be expire. Then the very next day I booked my domain with Google for full 10 years. I got to know that if I would have gone with GoDaddy, I would have paid 1.5+ times the price I paid for Google for 10 years. Only first year the charge less for a domain. From next year they charge comparatively more.  In summary, GoDaddy wanted me to pay GoDaddy for a brokerage of domain held by GoDaddy. So that GoDaddy negotiate a price to be paid to GoDaddy from me to get me a domain on GoDaddy. This long one is just out of frustration which is nearly hate for them. Try some good Registation services and try to avoid them.",IN

Meanwhile, I got branding made, logo etc etc. I searched to see who owns the domain… Surprise surprise, the domain is registered by godaddy, and it is on sale now for $1,500. Super shady.  In the past I’ve spoken to the customer service agents and mentioned a domain which was was on sale for no premium charge, when I check back later that evening it was on sale for $3000.

Why you might ask? Because it turns out their ""protection"" system was saving my domain in case I decide to use it again. I never manually asked for this domain to be saved, nor it was mentioned anywhere that I'll be paying $60 for something that I've never used. Turns out that they can't even offer me a refund. Not only that...their support can't escalate the chat to a superior. This is a scam service 101. Extremely unhelpful and unethical. And wait this is not it...

I paid ""buy now"" price for a domain on Godaddy auctions. But they can not take immediate action. Do not misunderstand me, domain is still on Godaddy. We are not waiting change of the registrant. People trust name of Godaddy. I paid for same reason. So many domain marketplaces can get immediate action about change of domain owner after ""buy now"" price payment. When I connect to online support, they say ""we can cancel and full refund."" If I want to get refund, I do request it. But I don't. I want the domain which I paid for.

I planned to cancel these domains but I missed out. As a result, I requested the refund outside of the refund timeframe. I talked with representative Sushmita and there was no understanding or willingness to accommodate the situation with a partial refund, even after she spoke to a representative. I thought about not writing this review and just sitting on the cost, but after realizing that GoDaddy used my 4 inactive domains to cover it with their GoDaddy ads & call to actions to 'register your domain', while I was sitting/paying them to host their Ad for almost 1+ year now ...

My sites were set up for auto-renew which I was aware and I was fully sure that they were all set to auto-renew for one year but one of them auto-renewed for 5 years and I was not aware this was how it was set and would have cancelled or changed it if I had known. I went to my bank account today and had no money as it was all taken out to pay for this auto-renew. I rang straight away and although I selected ""billing"" on the phone was connected to someone who told me they were in customer service and he would have to contact billing on my behalf, I was on hold with him for nearly 20 mins only to be told basically ""tough"" their policy doesn't allow any allowance. It's not like I want to not be their customer just renew for a year as I cannot afford to renew for 5 years we are in an energy crisis and a world financial crisis and they have no compassion or allowance for human nature just using policy as an excuse not even allowing me to talk to the person I need to talk to, I didn't even receive an invoice for the transaction so didn't know why they had taken so much until I rang. They will now be losing a customer as soon as I can finally get aware from this horrible company",IE

We have Website and Premier Marketing. 4 1/2 years with this site and All is well until the new ""automations"" push. I am not happy with the updated Booking Confirmation. We use bookings to schedule appointments. Those appointment prices vary and are not posted on our website. We use ""Custom"" and put in verbiage that Pricing Varies. Previous Booking Confirmation was not reflective of any pricing - Just ""Custom"" and under the Booking Confirmation portion of the email it listed Price: Varies. In addition on the Booking Confirmation portion the Whole Address was list out - it no longer is, just the street address. I do like that there is an edit to some of the things in the confirmation emails - we can add our logo, and also add text if we want, but cannot undo any of the Order Confirmation pricing. Perhaps for those of us that use the Calendar/Appointments for just that a different feature could be utilized. Thanks.",US

In an effort to dumb things down for users who know nothing about managing hosting and domains, they have added like 15 more steps to do things then there were before (I may be exaggerating).  When adding domains to Managed Wordpress Sites, I often have to remove and reconnect them because it doesn't work properly the first time.  There was an option to clone a MWP site, it did not work.  When trying to manage DNS records, it has can't edit, can't delete when I cancelled any products it would have been tied to.  Chat support goes to India which goes against everything GoDaddy stood for keeping US support in the US.  The people in India have no idea what they are doing.  So once I wasted 15 minutes in chat of them saying they can't transfer to the US, I'm currently on hold for basic DNS support on why there is an issue where I can't edit the DNS on my domain and I've currently been on hold for over 20 minutes with no answer yet.  Wait times definitely longer than what I am used to.  Maybe the GoDaddy Pro experience should be formatted differently. Started chat at 1:15 pm, started phone call at about 1:30, took 40 minutes for a rep to be on the line.  I don't think GoDaddy should ever ""lock"" the DNS regardless if it is connected to a product in the account.  The system glitches (which have become more frequent) stop people from being able to manage their own domain. A simple DNS problem took 1 hour and 10 minutes to correct completely (then await propagation to make sure it's 100% resolved)",US

Today I learn the deluxe online storage service I use is the onlinefilefolder.  They have deleted/lost all the files I've paid them to host until April 2024!!! How could anyone could trust them with anything after this is beyond me! They also can't seem to get their head around why I am due a refund for at least the 6months they won't be providing the service, suggesting I should have cancelled within 30days of the renewal in April. I'd never use them again and would actively encourage people to look elsewhere. Their support maybe 24/7 but the quality is shockingly bad/useless. 10mins pass between each chat message, can only imagine they are dealing with multiple frustrated customers at the same time or are trying to get you to give up and go away.

The call was raised because despite no changes having been made to my site, the appointment booking facility failed. Clearly an issue with a GoDaddy update. This time the call was initially handled better than previously as the customer service representative actually listened and didn't try to fix the issue himself. He escalated the problem to Level 2 Technical support in the Barcelona office. In view of my previous experiences where staff have fiddled with my website and changed the settings or removed elements without my permission, I gave strict instructions that NO staff were allowed to make ANY changes to my website.  The only permission granted was to view my website and then to provide instructions for me to fix it. I repeated these instructions four times in case there was any language comprehension issues (as there had been previously since many of the staff are Spanish).  The customer service representative was very clear with his understanding of these instructions and apologised for the previous issues I had experienced. So feeling confident I could trust GoDaddy not to make changes to my website, I left the issue with them. With a few hours I checked on my site and saw that not only had someone in Level 2 Technical support completely ignored my instructions, but that the colours of my website had been changed and, even more serious, the title of one of the sections had been changed (I refer to this section by name throughout the website so customers would no longer be able to find it). I am outraged that no one at GoDaddy appears to respect customers' wishes.  I am disappointed that I had to correct the edits myself. I am frustrated that the history of changes saved by GoDaddy does not show what has been changed so I am left not knowing what has been removed, edited, updated on my site and what may still be incorrect. Why is it so hard to carry out customer's wishes GoDaddy? I am an experienced GoDaddy website builder - many of the staff have commented on how professional the site looks like and that it is one of the best they have seen. When I tell GoDaddy that I am capable of making any edits needed as a result of a GoDaddy software update, I am capable! I do not want my wishes to be ignored any more and am seriously considering leaving GoDaddy and having my website built by a developer which would mean I was no longer in fear that my website was going to be wrecked by incompetent GoDaddy technical staff who need to fiddle with someone's website to get the result, rather than having the expertise required to understand the issue without dabbling with someone's live website. I would like a response as I'm so fed up with having to raise the same issue again and again and again. This must be the 8th time that someone at GoDaddy has changed my website without my permission. That is a shocking catalogue of repeated errors. Worse, I phoned in to report this issue and was asked to send an email detailing the issue. I stayed on the phone to ensure that the email had been received and waited until it had been forwarded to the relevant department. However, no one has bothered to reply.... I think that shows what GoDaddy are like.",GB

Reading the great comments about GoDaddy and their amazing customer service where you can actually speak to someone sounded ideal so we went for it. As long as you don't have a complaint to file the customer service team is helpful. Although you are given different advice from each team member. If you want to buy a product from them they are excellent. Sadly this is not the case when you are not happy with something. There is literally no option when you call them. When you send a chat they divert you to call the customer support team who is not able to transfer you to anyone who can listen to your issue and address it. They offer a call back that suits them and if you miss the call, though. They will email you ... apparently.  I was advised that for the UK there is only one person who deals with complaints. SHOCKING!  I spent hours and hours of trying to find out what the complaints procedure is and I still don't know. I spoke to different people all advising different things.

The social media tweaks seem to have finished (it was a known back-end problem which some chat agents were not aware of) this morning and I am now able to post via GoDaddy again. I have suggested that for known problems customers are informed via email to prevent frustrations, and I hope that this has been taken on board. Originally 2 stars, now upgraded to 4. Provided I have no further issues I would continue to recommend GoDaddy to other business owners. Original review: GoDaddy has continually tweaked their websites+ecommerce marketing dashboards. Since their last 'update' the social media feed onto my dashboard does not work. I have spent over 4.5hrs on live chat trying to get them to fix it. It was left with - 'our tech team will rebuild and I will email you when it is fixed' - now over 8 weeks and nothing. During that interaction I was promised a good discount on renewal - when I asked I was given a pittance and found a code on search which gave me more of a discount. Today, another 'tweak'. The dashboard is now not loading properly. I cannot run an e-commerce website if you cannot provide me with a functioning platform.",GB

After several calls to try to figure out the issues, and frankly nothing was solved, I called again and on my next call your John Rene received my call. John solved everything!! John was extremely knowledgeable about your product and his service was top-notch and he was excellent (and friendly) to deal with as well! We even shared a few good laughs! I was not happy when I called but I knew almost instantly that John knew your product and I was confident he would be able to resolve the issues, which he did very well! Sadly, in today's culture customer service isn't a very high priority. This why I am so impressed with John Rene so much! John was nothing short of incredible, efficient, and professional which is not the norm in customer service today. I am so appreciative of John's patience and diligence that I feel it necessary to contact Go Daddy to tell you of John Rene's diligence and excellence. I imagine with a high amount of confidence that John consistently serves every customer of your company he deals with in the same prudent and professionally intelligent manner. I personally think this young man deserves a raise and also think John should train other employees (some frankly need a little help in the customer service department). I hope upper management sees this message. I believe someone who is very good at what they do should be acknowledged and rewarded. That’s why I am writing this message. I hope John Rene is rewarded by Go Daddy! John Rene was not only, by far, the most talented and knowledgeable Go Daddy employee I have dealt but also the best customer service representative I have done business with in any company in a very long time. Our phone call was over 2 hours! Thank you to Go Daddy for having such a great employee and for having an awesome website builder. Talent like John Rene is hard to find! By the way, I will be purchasing another Premium package website in the future about my research. I am a very happy customer!! And a lot of that happiness can be attributed to John Rene.

GoDaddy helped me rectify it all!","As a life coach who works with clients online, by phone and in person, my website is essential as my representation to people who are seeking assistance (and particularly those who are not local), as the place where sessions or coaching packages are purchased. Imagine my surprise and horror when a new client informed me that as she tried to pay for a coaching session, a warning message came up saying it was not safe to share personal information on that page! I immediately spent an hour on the phone with the GoDaddy help department, and found out that I had to update my outdated marketing system. I tried to arrange to pay for the update with a credit card that was awaiting its latest payment before it would allow my purchase to go through. The GoDaddy representative there gave me all available discounts and refunds for time I had paid for but would not be able to use with the old system, and then patiently waited over the next few days for my credit card payment to be applied. I immediately began working to replace the one page of my website where online purchases are available but when I went to publish what I thought was a single page of a six page website, that one page replaced my entire website, leaving the payment page and nothing else! The entire original website had vanished into the ether-world! The next two days. I worked with the website maintenance and design team to help me try to restore my original website and just change the payment page to make my website user and payment friendly. After a marathon 3-hour call, we were able to modernize and improve my website, using the old text content while also making it safe and reassuring for clients that want to pay for coaching online. In each department where I received assistance, the GoDaddy staff were knowledgeable, patient, polite and extremely helpful. After just one day down, my website is live again, looking more modern and attractive than it has in years! I look forward to working with them again soon to help me with my SEO!",US

Immediately after locking me out of my email and requiring me to remove and make changes to my email software account settings to re-access it, two things happened. I lost all my old email prior to that point (last June) and my mailbox has registered as full, or close to it, for the first time ever in my decade-old account with you. Look at the screenshots. I have less than 400 total emails in my inbox. Yet the settings indicate there are almost 3,000 and I can't clear that out. I get a full mailbox alert every week and have to clear out any junk to squeak out a little more space each time. Before you ask, I have escalated the issue several times. I have asked for a manager several times. I have been told ridiculous things each time about the discrepancy between the small amount of emails in my inbox that only date back to June, and the amounts listed in my settings. I am plugged to pay more to upgrade my service each time. I AM  PAYING TOO MUCH RIGHT NOW FOR THE LIMIT OF 500 OR SO EMAILS AT MY AVAILABILITY, FROM A COMPANY THAT LOST THOUSANDS OF MY EMAILS CAUSING IRREPARABLE HARM TO ME.

I attempted to see if the discount offer would be applied through the Chat available. It was instantly apparent that would not work for my situation. So I tried the Text option, naively thinking this would be a real person on the other end. I can only assume it wasn't because after 2hr 20min I had received three (3) requests for my PIN and customer number, and told to hold on twice so they might check for the appropriate discount. I had already sent them a screen shot of the offer I was emailed and a screen shot of the product I was trying to renew. After this 2hr + text exchange I attempted to reach someone by phone. After placing the call I was on hold for 12 minutes at which time I was cut off. I tried again and after 9 minutes I was able to speak with someone who ultimately answered my question. It shouldn't be this difficult, nor should it take as long as it did in my case. I realize no one has enough staff and it's hard to find people to work but I think you would be better served to take less inquiries that are resolved w/o leaving the customer hanging for an extended period than trying to respond to every call you get right then.  I also think people would understand this. Surely anyone that's been out to eat would relate to how hard it is to have staff. Instead of repeating "" we can't wait to exceed your expectations"" every minute or so, be more genuine and let them know you're working through whatever it is and that you are trying to get them taken care of. It's a little disingenuous to go on about how you can't wait to exceed the customer's expectation when you can meet a basic expectation of taking/responding to their question.",US

This must be the biggest SCAM I every had. If you read this review and still get scammed, it would really be a shame that you fell for their big name. Never ever make a mistake buying a domain from Godaddy, They are thieves and can digest your premium domain, I have a premium domain on my business website with massive SEO traffic on it, I had invested Thousands of $ in 3 years in regard to SEO of that domain, the domain is under my ownership since 2019 and out of the blue I got an email that my website is under some malware attack and we are suspending your domain.  I had a word with the support and they assured me that you can access to your domain within 72 hours. I got another email after 72 hours that we have permanently deleted your domain without any reason and justification.  They have pathetic customer support, they don't respond on chat and on call.

The last two interactions I’ve had with godaddy ‘customer service’ have had the price display at a lower price than what my final invoice states — the last rep managed to screen-capture the better price as well as the change during the completed transaction, and promised to follow-up with me within a couple of hours to fix things, but never did. I followed up, had to tell the story again and was treated like I was in the wrong. Apparently the previous csr hadn’t left proper notes on our hour+ phone call !?!

Since it was a free product, Google offered no way to get this resolved. The only way was to access was through Google workspace online, which required using an account with admin privileges. Since I set this up for Mom in 2008, I had no recollection of creating a separate email address for admin purposes. After digging through old emails, a week later Mom found the admin account name. Of course, password unknown, to reset I needed access to Mom's email which was suspended. Fortunately, I had purchased Mom's domain through GoDaddy and not Google, had we had used Google, the domain would have been lost. I had no idea what Mom's GoDaddy account and password were, so we went through the GoDaddy account recovery form, which online stated a response in 3 days, no response, so I called. Speaking to a GoDaddy support member, I was told that the wait time was 7 days not 3. After 7 days I called in again, that GoDaddy support rep checked with account recovery and said, not 3, nor 7, days, but 22 days. 22 days passed I called again, this time I got Michelle, she checked with next tier support, and they told her I was not even in the queue for account recovery. Note the other 3 support reps told me I was definitely in the queue and to be patient. Michelle found this unacceptable and worked with me for over an hour to gain access to my account, she helped by modifying DNS for me to get at TXT record to Google to gain access to my Google workspace account, then a MX record to get my emails sent to another provider while I worked on the google account.

There were technical issues which could only be done on his end and certain details that had to be done on my end, a complete nood. Nonetheless, he walked me through the cyber landmines and rug-pulls and got everything up and running. Issue resolved.  He completely turned what could have been a very frustrating encounter into an easy-to-follow teaching moment--a masterclass. How about that.  On the survey, not only did give Steve the highest score, I also recommended that he get a raise. I hope it goes through. At the end of the day, any company whose employees, like Steve, are ""servicing"" paying customers with such care and respect are, truly, worth their weight in gold. Great job Steve and Godaddy.

The code received via text does not work despite several attempts and getting multiple codes. This means that when trying to remove a 302 temporary redirect from my domain i have been unable to and has caused the re-launch of my website to be put on hold until this can be resolved. The first operative did not sound like they know what whey were talking about. On my second call they person advised they can not take off the 302 re-direct themselves and i had to fill in a form to remove the 2FA from my account and they would try and get this resolved the same day. 1 Day later chasing this up i have the very vague answer when speaking to them again that the issue is with the team to verify and remove 2FA but they are unable to confirm how long this will take. This means despite the issue being on GoDaddy's side i am stuck with no real answer as to when this will be resolved and am unable to re-launch my online store. 1 week has passed and i am still stuck without my 2FA or domain forwarding removed. The latest update is that this may take 9 working days as staff are working from home. This has apparently finally been escalated to a manager despite this having been asked for last week.,CH

When it cannot be resolved this way, the support rep says they will ask SmartLine dept. to call you, which they never do. This has happened three times. I've lost many prospective customers because of this. I do not recommend GoDaddy for SmartLine as their tech support for this product does not exist. This comes from the top of the company. The first level support representatives are courteous and it's obvious they want to help you, but there is nothing they can do.

Forget BigBlackBag - I think it's a scam now. You need to be an SEO wiz for WIX and SquareSpace and there is no one available to talk to who can and is willing to help. However, I have been a GoDaddy customer for several years now and there is ALWAYS someone I can speak with to help. That alone is worth my time, money and trouble to build a site that I need to showcase my work. What good is a website builder with no person-to-person support?

6057,www.godaddy.com,2022-10-10T20:25:00.000Z,1,Thumbs down to GoDaddy,"Got an email from GoDaddy this morning that my primary email account (that I use for my business) would be suspended in TWO days. Woke me up!!!! Signed on to GoDaddy. Waited in queue for 1hr and 3mins... while the recording ""we can't wait to exceed your expectations..."" replayed at interminably short intervals. Also, to my recollection that cheesy message about due to unforeseen blah.. blah... has been playing since Covid began. My primary email was due to auto-renew A MONTH LATER. One of my other domain email accts was due to renew 5 DAYS LATER.  Checked my payment methods (I have 2 on file) and all were good. Tried to find out what the renewal costs would be for these products. Couldn't navigate their site. Lots of ""Upgrade.."", ""Get More.."", ""Extra$..."" etc., but no ""How Much?"". Speaking of which... have you ever noticed how much more expensive Internet Domain related products cost at time of renewal compared to initial setup? Surely, it's much cheaper to renew than the cost to the provider of setting up the service. If I buy a magazine subscription and the publisher offers a reduced cost for a period, seems to me the publisher always lets me know how much to renew? Hmmm? To me, having email service is much akin to having healthcare service. You can't be without it. The one bright thing about my discouraging episode with GoDaddy was my contact with the customer service gentleman. Despite the fact that our call was crackled and we couldn't hear one another for long periods of time he hung in - as did I. His name was Rick. He promised to pass my comments and the recorded conversation up the chain of management - for review. Hopefully, to somebody who gives a damn!",US

I felt lost, quite frankly, and nothing seemed to be working. A friend recommended GoDaddy, and he was right - it's a homerun.  I was able to build my website with confidence, and the customer service was simply amazing at getting me over a few hurdles - you know, the stuff that's ""Greek"" to us but commonspeak for them.  My ""savior"" today was Daniel, and he was incredibly patient, kind, and knowledgeable. Daniel shored up the technical parts that were just above my skill level (I'd made quite a mess before I found GoDaddy and we had to bring that all together) and carried me to the finish line.  Thanks to Daniel's assistance, I am in business now.  Thank you, Daniel and thank you, GoDaddy!!",US

He also gave me a reference number should I have issues with my email being suspended and that they were working on fixing the system. He went above and beyond to ask me how my day was and being friendly and kind and helping me to get everything sorted out. Go Daddy needs a lot more Renz on the team.

I had an issue with one of my domains not displaying, and Tedy (my service rep) had an idea as to the root cause of the issue and she was SPOT ON.   That is a testament of how knowledgable the GoDaddy staff is with the product they sell.  That speaks volumes to someone referring another customer to a service provider.  I don't want to tell someone ""go try this"" and it turn out to be a dud.  My name is ruined and I start to erode my credibility.  With the service that Tedy gave me, I would recommend anyone to GoDaddy!  Tedy not only got my non-functioning domain fixed, but easily helped me get my new one up and running to begin development.  My time is extremely valuable.  The ease that Tedy allowed me to resolve all of my issues enabled me to go and invest time to the more important things - my family and my work.  That is INVALUABLE for someone like me, and I truly thank Tedy for that.  I thank GoDaddy for employing Tedy!  She is the type of employee that deserves to be rewarded because it is service like what she provided me as to why myself and countless others like me will remain loyal to GoDaddy and spend our money where we know we'll be taken care of!!!",US

6263,www.godaddy.com,2022-10-07T02:41:59.000Z,1,GoDaddy's illegal behaviour should be reported to the ACCC,"GoDaddy should be referred to the ACCC for illegal terms. If you toggle 'autorenew' to 'off' in the Dashboard, the privacy and protection that you currently have on a domain will be removed and you will have to pay $10 to put it back on. This is illegal because you paid for that cover at the same time you paid for the domain and it should not expire until the domain expires.  I have been with GoDaddy for at least 2 years and currently have 6 domains there. Until now I didn't have to use their support team but because of what's happened, and the support response, I will definitely be moving my business elsewhere.  In more detail: Yesterday I turned off autorenewal on 2 domains that are not due to expire for almost 2 and 6 months. I did this via the Domain page on the Dashboard. The same page shows that Privacy is unchanged (still on) but I received an email saying that it had been removed because of my actions. When I called GoDaddy about it, I was told that yes, it was removed because I had removed autorenewal on those domains. When questioned the grounds of this, I was told that it was my fault that I hadn't phoned Support to make the changes (instead of doing it via Dashboard). (And note that I'd already been on hold to Support for over half an hour.) I was also told that the Dashboard was only for turning on autorenewal, not off. Then the phone went silent and eventually he hung up on me.  The next day I called again and got a nicer person. Unfortunately, she told me the same thing: that yes, privacy and protection were removed because I had removed autorenewal and I would have to pay $10 to put each one back on. When I questioned the details re legality of this, she was about to read to me what the exact words had been in the confirmation text that I'd agreed to (and I said I would write it down) but then, suddenly, the line went silent and then cut off - once again.  Clearly very dodgy and I can assure GoDaddy that after this experience, they have lost a customer with multiple domains. I actually think this behaviour is illegal and should come to the attention of the ACCC. I paid for domain privacy and protection for 12 months. There is nothing on the Dashboard saying that if I toggle autorenew off (for the next year), that I forfeit any remaining protection on my existing domains (especially without refund). And how dodgy is it that your tech support have no sensible answers in this situation and can only cut the line off when the questions get too hard? I hope I can upload some screenshots here from my GoDaddy Dashboard and the email I received.",AU
