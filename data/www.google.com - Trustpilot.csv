Less than 3 months after the install the ground had sunken in significantly (10+ inches in a few areas).  Also 2 holes about 7 or so inches in diameter and many inches deep fomed on each end of where the tank is buried.  I called Carolina Septic pro multiple times and sent several pictures of the issues.  I was told on multiple occasions that I would be called back ""by the end of the day"" and I never was.  The owner of the company sent me an email over a week after my first call and a week after I emailed pictures to tell me that I was informed there would be settlement in the ground and that I should add some top soil and plant some grass seed.  I asked him to tell me how I was informed regarding the settlement as I am confident no one told me that.  (No response received.)  Also, the amount of settlement looks extreme/severe.  Additionally, there are 2 circular holes that developed on each end of where the tank is buried.  I also noted  to the office and owner from the pictures you can clearly see there is dirt 2 or 3+ feet of dirt scattered beyond where the tank is buried.  So it looks like they just didn't do a good job putting all the dirt back where they got it from (where the tank is buried).  I think doing that properly would have minimized any  settlement/sinkage.  I asked if someone could just come out and look at my concerns (with the settlement and with the holes) and the office and owner refused.  Towards the end, one of the office workers said she would put me on the schedule to have someone come out to look at my concerns, but then another office worker told me she should not have told me that and she would be spoken to about telling me she would schedule someone to come out to look at it.  This ranks as one of my worst customer service experiences ever.  To not simply send someone out to look at the situation and then assess it showed they did not care for or value me as a customer.  The pictures (as is often the case with pictures) don't really show the full degree to which the ground is sunken in.  And while you can see the holes in the pictures, you can't see down them.  Totally disgusted with Carolina Septic Pro and will never do business with them again.  When they first came out to dig up/inspect the original tank, the tech couldn't even find where it was buried.  So, they had to reschedule to send someone else out; a more experienced person.  I should have known at that point that I needed to find another company.  I regret ever doing business with Carolina Septic Pro. Simply sending someone out to spend 5 minutes assessing the situation and giving me their comments afterwards would have made a world of difference.  But now I don't trust them, will never do business with them again, and certainly won't refer anyone to them.",US

This would be OK, because web has become the norm, but they seem to firstly have no consistency, and secondly have a very strange view of how to structure information in a logical way.  Google Admin feels like it's designed by comittee. It constantly changes and none of the information is where you expect it to be - and it often isn't there at all.  The Suite of Workspace tools are very ""google"", and by this I mean they want your soul and don't want to give it back. They have poor interoperability with other systems and are basically doing what the founders of Google hated about Microsoft. Google Docs can't read in Word Documents with any consistency, and you can't separate gdocs ""files"" from the web because they don't really exist in a physical form - they aren't really files but references to a location in Google Drive, meaning you have to export to another file format to work with anyone outside Google. 365 can do this because they have the most popular word processing software on planet earth, google doesn't. This is the same thing they did with the ill-faited Google Spaces.  They want you in their ecosystem and don't want to play ball with others.  Finally on this point, Google was OK when it was all free over lockdown, in fact, I would say lockdown saved ChromeOS and Google Workspace to some degree. But now, they are starting to creep extra costs into it, removing features and functionality and pushing them into a paid for solution. I would prefer them to have been upfront from the start and charge from the outset. Now we have thousands of users and we seem to be approaching a situation where we might find they charge us for the users after the fact.  2) Google in general don't follow their old moto of ""don't be evil"". They manipulate information, attempt to control narratives and are part of the silcon valley oligarchy. They will happily remove things from their search at will, derank and promote things they politically and socially agree with. They are a danger to everyone on planet earth and shouldn't be allowed to act as a publisher whilst having the protections of a service provider.  I accept that Google will be around in people's lives, but handing them your digital identity and allowing them to manipulate you to their way of thinking isn't good for anyone.  This isn't even touching on YouTube, a platform which has a stranglehold on information and is run by a tyrant in sheeps clothing.",GB

Their advertisement was very tempting and we had our wedding anniversary due so I thought my lovely wife, who is seriously ill with cancer, would be delighted to have a print of our daughter, her husband Ash and our grandson Luke, the apple of our eyes. The order was placed about 5 weeks before the anniversary giving ample time to be delivered before the big day.  Obviously nothing turned up, we were advised that there had been delays because of mail chaos but matters had been resolved. We waited and waited but to no avail, nothing came our way. On the eve of our anniversary I was hugely despondent knowing the surprise present was not available still hoping that a miracle might happen. The day arrives and there amongst my morning emails is a missive from Google asking how well had they done with the transaction. It seems they had delivered my parcels somewhere other than my home, no explanation given and no reply sent to a blistering email sent by myself to them that morning. I've yet to receive any response to my complaint, my emails are simply ignored. It has cost me nearly £60 for nothing but heartache. If a firm like Google can't relate to a small guy like myself there is scant chance for anyone.",GB

Terri the office manager will have you dismissed if you disagree with how they treat you. That in itself is ludicrous. She said Dr. Komer made this decision but yet he is on vacation. When asked to speak with him when he returns she refuse and said your no longer our patient. They hang up on you, and will NOT allow you very calmly to even say what you need to say. I asked do you feel it was appropriate to hang up on a very worried mom (the first time a week ago) and she said we will not agree so no point in having this conversation with you and just hangs up.(now the 2nd time) There's definitely a point to having the conversation because everything can be worked out and they should be willing to actively hear you as a patient. It truly is not always the patient's fault but Terri and her staff will make you feel like that. Does not even allow you to speak even when you have very real medical concerns! Working in the medical field for over 25 years, this was some of the worst care I have ever heard. It's very scary that your personal attitude (the staff) comes before quality patient care! Terri said and I quote. ""you will be dismissed if you leave a negative review about our staff"". So as a patient, you can no longer have an opinion about the way you are treated you just have to sit back and take the verbal abuse and then get hung up on. It's okay for the office to be VERY disrespectful and if you even question it YOU WILL BE DISMISSED! That is sad and scary when your child is on medication that he needs and now his care is at risk due to the staff, not even the doctor deciding they don't like certain individuals. You should always be heard even if you disagree that is the right thing to do. So sad you get dismissed while the staff gets a good job we got rid of those patients' high five. All Patients should be provided a reason and be able to talk through the reason. This office will not listen and hear your heart. Very sad, that in itself, I would not recommend this office. You will not be heard only Dismissed. All Dr should always want to resolve any issues and dismissing should always be a last resort. Children's Medical center would not recommend!",US

I am very certain that I know who but I have no solid proof. This particular google account has all my passwords, photos, and identifiable info saved to it. That info includes a photo with a crystal clear view of the account and routing numbers. Whoever changed the password now has easy access to my money. If it really is the person I strongly believe it is that did this he will stop at nothing to make me hurt as much as humanly possible. I have made every possible attempt to recover my account up to and including trying to personally contact someone from google. The only thing I managed to accomplish is filing a report through another google account and being told that google needs 5 days to verify I am me. 5 FREAKING days!!! Are you freaking kidding me. Number 1 whoever changed my password didn't have to verify anything to get in and change the password. Number 2 when my financial health and all is on the line Waiting 5 days is like waiting a lifetime. 5 days is plenty of time for this idiot to cost me thousands of dollars if not more and get access to not only my social security number but also my dads who is a joint account holder on this account. He very well can destroy my life beyond repair as well as my dad's. This is absolutely 1000% unacceptable from one of the world's top technology companies. I can't even explain how anybody accessed my account but they did. I didn't purposely save this photo. It was on an old phone that I had backed up without realizing the photo was on there. As of when this complaint was filed there has been 0 response from google in regards to regaining access to my account or fixing their screw-up. I don't use any of the security features that google offers just because of how hard its been to recover accounts in the past. I will not be using those features after this either.

191,www.google.com,2022-12-26T22:34:18.000Z,1,Viva Wyndham,"Viva Wyndham, Freeport, Bahamas All Inclusive Rip Off (Resort) Besides the sands of the beach and the dust in the air, I only remember the Tip cups everywhere. I have traveled all over the world and this is the clearly the worst resort, of any type, I have seen. I will give my comments below: A.	The Grounds: They do not move the grass. Tall grass simply get pressed down and traps the dust and allergens that get released when the wind increases. Anyone with asthma or other respiratory allergies, STAT AWAY. B.	The Jacuzzi: Was not cleaned in two days and water was filthy C.	The Buildings: All common buildings are kept with windows open and AC off. Dust is always in the air. First time I tried to take a shower, almost slipped and fell as the shower floor is marble with no mat to protect. The hot/cold water flow controls in the entire building were opposite to the world standard. Hot was to the right and cold to the left. D.	The Food: Regular guests only get buffets. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. With at least 400 guests as I could see, I wonder what they use to cook the food in. Metal buckets, I guess. E.	THE BAR: Now that is something to observe. The barmen are trained to pour drinks with a flash dance to avoid the guest seeing what they are pouring. I am paraphrasing but the gin is Roberto, and the vodka is Ronaldo. Could not tell where they were made. Oh, the scotch was Sir Robert! The best quality Scotch in the bar is Johnny Walker Red. And the best vodka is Smirnoff.  Now my experience at the bar: On the first night I went for a pre-dinner drink. Asked for a Smirnoff with tonic. The barman said, no. For VIP guests only. I requested to talk to the manager on duty. Had to walk over to another building as they would not call him on the phone. He and the Customer Service Manager did meet me after a half hour and the took another hour to get someone above to approve a drink of Smirnoff Vodka, by accepting me as a VIP.  Next night. Same thing. Shift manager was playing with his cell phone at the bar so I got him quick. Mr. Jorge asked me how he could help. Okay, he said and walked away. Never heard from him. NEVER, not even the next morning To make a point, I did not want to drink the unknown brands as I could not tell the origin and do not like to take a risk with methanol poisoning. F: While I am waiting for Mr. Jorge to return I met a French Canadian young man Alexander and his 11 year old son Sebastian. They are traveling together, and Dad wanted to use the gym. He took his son with him, gave him a tablet to play and had him sit down next to where he was working out. Turns out that is against the rules. He got booted out. But the RULE taketh over. G: The only place I have seen where the convenience store/gift shop workers expect a tip is at this resort. H: STAFF: The management and staff are all poorly trained, unhappy and I would suggest need to be replaced. The only exceptions, Anthea is one of the senior Serving Staff for private groups. She is superb and so is her staff. Basil, the Captain of the Dive Boat could teach the Managers a thing or two about Customer Service and Service recovery. I did tell the Managers that I intend to write and publish a review on the internet. They could not care less. I am not familiar with their Membership program and will not comment on whether it makes sense. What I can say is that a Club where only VIP members (those who pay even more) get C class liquor seems a little strange!",US

I wrote down my order number and arrived at the store on Saturday to pick up the item. The place was like a zoo and i was treated like an animal. There were lots of staff in purple jackets walking  around. I found the collection desk and stood there the assistant served the lady in front of me and then walked away , began talking to her colleague and just left me standing there. I waited awhile then followed her over to other desk and asked her ' are you working or just talking to your colleague' she said that she wasnt working so i asked her who is 'maning' the collection desk then. She returned and said ok I will help you so i explained that i was there to collect an order i had purchased on line. she said ' you have a message' i told her yes. she said well look at your message i told her i had. three times  she just said to me look at your message. so i went back to my car got my glasses and read the message and realised you could tell the store that you had arrived. I then went back into the store and just stood there for about another 10 minutes no one spoke to me. so i spoke to another member of staff to indicate that i was waiting he just said to me someone will soon be able to help you. so i just stood around for another 5 minutes, before i approached another member of staff standing at the front and asked why was the customer service so bad then he asked why would you say that so i explained that i am waiting for my order and i am sure its not going to fall from the ceiling into my hands so someone must be getting and i just need to know when will that be. it was only then that he went into the back and brought out this really nice gentleman call Sunil. he was the first  person that treated me like a person, he explained that he was going to look for my order; he helped me to take it to me car. he was such a gentleman. it is sad that he was the last person that i interacted with because the other were unhelpful and rude. I cant imagine what it is like for someone going into that store who is unable to read or reading in English.

I had ordered off the festive 2 course menu, the Festive Gourmet burger double up and the Rhubarb Galette. A few of the partly had starters inc my wife, the butter supplied with the King prawn cocktail was that frozen she couldn’t spread it, i ended up eating it, a lump of frozen butter on some bread. (It was a good job that i did, has you will read later)  When all the main meals came out, my meal was missing, so a meal was rustled up and put in front of me, the burger looked like it had had a accident on the way from the kitchen, i looked at it and noticed a white something on the top of the burger and ask my wife to confirm what it was it was an egg (i can’t tell you how much i hate eggs to the point that i have a phobia) so the whole of my meal is ruined, so i walked over to a member of staff as no one had been over to our table to check if the meals where ok, i pointed out that it was the wrong meal and showed a photo of the menu on my phone which didn’t state that it came with egg, luckily i had a copy of the menu on my phone as no menu’s were available on the table. She apologised and explained about another burger that they did which had egg on, and took the meal away. Next thing another member of staff appeared, now sarcastically asking me all sorts of questions on the food???  I thought for a few seconds on how hard it was to make a meal that was standard on the Christmas menu and told her to just forget it, i’ll just have a pudding they wouldn’t mess that up i thought (was i so wrong). During our starter and main meal no one came to check that our meals were ok, (inc the ketchup bottle being empty) before they had finished bringing the meals out my son’s girlfriends steak was not cooked enough and had to be cooked some more, in fact she still couldn’t eat it and took it home for her dogs, my wife had the Festive turkey and couldn’t eat most of that, most of the meal was not cooked right or was cold, but there was no staff around to tell. Pudding finally came out and guess what again no pudding for me, and once again no staff to ask where it is. My wife and a friend ordered the Boozy Christmess and my wife loves deserts but could not eat it, it was horrible (no meringue and my friends was the same so that was only part eaten as well, best described as someone being sick on a plate (First time i have ever seen my wife leave a desert). By now the happy atmosphere of our night out had turned sour, and got worse when my mate sitting next to me asked me what had i said to the waitress as she was crying in the kitchen, what the hell i hadn’t said a bad thing other than trying to sort out my meal. Part of the problem i think was having to email in your order before hand and no one checked on the day that everything was still correct, or even checked during the meal. I know England were playing and we ended up with some of our party going into the bar to see some of it, but you only saw staff bring food out and sitting at a table at the bottom of the stairs, were they watching the match? Thanks for a Very bad evening, Very bad food (well having no food at all that night so i can’t comment on it) and causing problems within the group that we ended up leaving early and just all going home, wouldn’t forget this night for a long time.  I wouldn’t recommend this place for its food and service, my wife was complaining of an iffy tummy the next day. oh ps all the women were complaining about how bad the smell in the toilets as well, i can only say the mens were clean but a whole in the ceiling next to the a/c unit. Oh to make thing worse for the men the ale ran out very early on in the evening.",GB

On multiple occasions I have contacted CHW to file claims on covered items only to be told that the services would NOT be covered! In October 2022, I contacted CHW to cancel my policies after yet again being told that a service was not covered. On 10/8 I spoke with a resolution representative A Moise, and during this conversation I was informed that my most recent claim was in fact approved to be covered; however, the company, Diamond Garage Doors and Openers, that had been dispatched to my home advised otherwise and charged me the total cost of the repair of $285.00. Ms Moise stated that under the circumstances she could refund me $150.00 as a courtesy; however, if I canceled the third policy that I would not be able to receive a refund of $150.00. When I expressed how absurd this was Ms Moise stated “you should have contacted us to question why my claim was being denied”. She further stated, “had you called we would have told you that it was covered and dispatched another vendor”. What??? So, it’s my fault that I can’t trust that the company with whom I’m doing business to do business with reputable contractors??? WOW!!! I was informed that it would take approximately 3 weeks to receive this refund check. At that time, I questioned what would happen if I didn’t receive the check prior to the next bank draft on November 1st. The representative informed me that I would indeed have the check prior to the next billing and that “I would need to contact CHW prior to Nov 1 to cancel the policy”. As I’d suspected, I did not receive the refund check until after November 1st, in fact, the date on the check was November 1, 2022 and I was again subject to a bank draft. On today, November 29, 2022 I contacted CHW to cancel the last active policy and to request a refund for the premium that I was charged. I spoke with a resolution manager named LaPorsha who’s tone I found extremely rude and was advised that a refund was not due to me because I’d had coverage for the entire month of November (even though no claims had been filed) and “that it was my fault because I opted to keep the policy active while awaiting the refund check”. Again, a courtesy refund for a fraudulent act that YOUR contractor committed. When I asked LaPorsha to speak with her management she advised me that she was a resolution manager and there was no one above her! After speaking with two different individuals, I can only assume that it is the practice of CHW to blame the policy holder for not following up when claims are denied, for expecting to be compensated when situations are outside of their control and for not watching the calendar and the mail delivery! This is ridiculous, and not only will I never do business with you, but I will also be filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and leaving reviews on every platform that I can to ensure others don’t utilize your terrible services either!

212,www.google.com,2022-10-26T19:54:50.000Z,1,Specifically regarding business listings,"They way Google Business listings are managed is absolutely atrocious. Myself and several other business owners are plagued with issues from the way that these pages can be seemingly edited and overtaken by anyone as they please. I have just had my page permanently deleted for ""Inactivity"" despite having logged in to the page within  the last 180 days of which they are claiming inactivity. I have received calls from their automated service to confirm business hours, and have received a steady stream of reviews which an inactive business would not get.  I have had issues in the past where my account was suspended pending me sending ""proof of registration"" for my business which would be impossible as I am a sole trader and therefore do not have to register with company house or any other body.  I am now not going to be appearing on Google searches until I can get my new business page up and running and then start the slow process of gathering new reviews (and I know if I ask for old customers to re-submit reviews I will likely get suspended for having so many reviews come in at once as they will look fake).  Google really need to rethink how the business pages are run (especially as the people who deal with the business pages for UK are not based in the UK and have no idea on how UK businesses work (see previous gripe with having my account suspended - the team had no idea about sole traders and not needing to be registered and it took over 3 weeks to sort out).  As someone who is self-employed this is going to SEVERELY impact my income over the coming weeks and months and I am VERY unimpressed.",GB

At 9.17pm we had enough and joined a queue of people awaiting refunds. Some hadn't received their meals at all like us, others had received cold food with missing items. It was an absolute sham. No Organization whatsoever. From what I could tell, the chefs had been slow, but the serving staff were even slower. The counter where food was placed was choc a block with cold food that was never delivered to tables.

This review is about the Google workspace service, which I have been using for business for over 7 years.  We recently sold one of the brands of the company, which led to us having to migrate the Google workspace to another owner.  We've done this several times in the past, so this should have gone pretty fast.  However, with this account, there seemed to be a ""technical issue"" related to Google cloud, as discovered by a Google support agent.  So when I was in the process of starting the migration, I first canceled the plan, as this was the first thing to do , and then I would have to delete the account, which would then allow migration. However, this is where the technical started, as it would say there were ""active projects"" in Cloud, which was not the case.  I tried to contact support, but of course, I had to get on a paid plan to contact support. So I immediately paid for a paid plan again, and then contacted support.  I got a reply back after 4 days wich a copy paste article about how to delete a cloud project.  I politely explained that there was no cloud project.  I then got the same email as a reply 4 times during the next 2 weeks.  After 2 weeks and like 30 emails with images, screen recordings and more, I finally get to talk to a real person.  After about 4 weeks, he finally calls me.  We go over the issue, and he says that there is a technical bug and that he will report it to technical support. (Agent: Pedro Jose) Note: we have had no access to the business email in over a month by now, because when i got on the plan to simply be able to talk to support, I got on the cheapest plan, which did not include email. This has resulted in customers not being able to reach us and over 50 reviews online about that we apparently closed our support. We have since had to change to an @gmail address and send this to all our customers.  I asked him how long this would last and he said he doesn't have a timeline.  Since he first reported this, it has now been another month and a half!  I've sent another 35 emails, praising him to reply, but without success. Email over email ignored... Now, 7 days ago, a new agent (""Henry"") emailed us back on the ticket saying this:  Your plan has been deactivated so we won't be replying to your support tickets anymore.  WHAT?????? This technical bug is currently taking our entire domain name and email hostage and preventing us from sending it to the buyer!!!!!!!!!! They recognized the technical bug, yet absolutely nobody is doing anything against it!!!!!! And we need to keep paying them to reply to our support messages whilst not even getting any replies!!!!!!!!!!!",BE

Given that this has NEVER resulted ANY resolution to any other problem I have ever had with Google, I figured this would not end well. I was right. I sent Google everything they asked for. Photos of both sides of the card, photos of the receipt, photos of the activation receipt, my name, birthdate, address, phone numbers, the name of the store where I purchased the card, (blood sample, hair sample, ritual sacrifices) and still they refused to help.  I expected no resolution, but I didn't expect the mocking and taunting of one employee sending me the complete code and locking me out of using it. I didn't expect an employee to outright say that they were not allowed to help. I actually felt like I was being laughed at while I was dealing with them. This of course was on top of the very serious consequences I was and am experiencing because of my inability to use the funds I purchased. I have been fighting with Google for five months over this, and have just finished multiple consecutive chats with the Google crime syndicate's customer no-support drones and have gotten the same lie every time: ""We regret any inconvenience this may have caused"".

Kung Pao chicken was too spicy, and the other 2 orders were not spicy at all. We had to keep adding soy sauce to add some kind of flavor.  The soups were also lacking in flavor. The only thing I devoured was the egg roll. Plus, the woman at the counter who took my money was less than friendly. Not even a ""thank you"" and when I asked her for chili oil, she lowered her voice and said that it would be $1 each additional. Now, I eat a lot of Asian food, and never have I heard such nonsense.

276,www.google.com,2022-09-24T02:14:34.000Z,1,Dark Lord of Surveillance Capitalism,"Google's motto is ""do good,"" last time I checked. Unfortunately, there are a considerable number of contradictions to that statement. Just clarifying, I mean the whole company rather than ""Google.com."" ""Creeped out"" is my general experience over the years the more research I've done and I'm glad to say I don't use their services. Perhaps ""do good"" doesn't include masquerading as Sauron's ""great eye"" at the top of the tower of Barad-dur from The Lord of the Rings? For the satirists out there, there is an amusing meme out there showing just that. 1) The Android operating system. Commonly used in smartphones and smart televisions. Unfortunately, this gives Google unprecedented access into the personal and private lives of practically half the planet thanks to the pervasiveness and sheer popularity of the smartphone. The combination of voice-recognition software, facial recognition, key-logging, location-tracking etc. makes the Android operating system perhaps the greatest piece of surveillance technology ever created. All of that data doesn't just go to Google; it goes to app developers (that give it to advertisers) and will also go through the Google network, which houses the largest advertising network in the world. Content recommendations and advertising will also be relevant on sites like Youtube as a result. And what makes the Android operating system such a nuisance and Google too, is the fact everyone practically has a smartphone with it. So, there's a strong possibility sending an SMS to an Android phone, from a basic phone even, can be used to target you depending on whether they have relevant identifiers available. There's quite simply no escape. 2) Gmail. Gmail is designed to use whatever your emails contain and distribute that information across the Google network, making your emails essentially not remotely private. It also doesn't matter if you use an end-to-end encrypted service; if you email somebody with Gmail, your emails will go to Google and content recommendations and advertising will be used to target you, based on IP information, device fingerprints (RAM country of origin, screen resolution, browser, operating system etc) and Google's ""ad ID."" Just explaining, a device fingerprint is created whenever devices connect to a server (they aren't stored on the connecting devices) and can uniquely identify a device and user within 10s of thousands of others. They're essential for security, but quite the nuisance for privacy. 3) Google search. Google search works largely the same as the others. Your searches are largely swallowed up and used to provide personalisation and advertising. There is again no privacy. 4) Google smart speaker. Another trump for surveillance capitalism - put this into your home and whatever is discussed will go to Google and again will be used in exactly the same way as the Android OS, largely thanks to the combination of voice recognition software and uploads of snippets of voice data. This is used to create content recommendations and advertising across the Google network through ""key-wording"", often regardless of whether you have an account and have ""agreed to the terms and conditions and privacy policies."" Realistically, friends, family, colleagues and strangers probably haven't and DO NOT appreciate being targeted based on their conversations. Again, largely identical to the smartphone OS. It's extremely plausible that the smartphone spawned this hideous creation. 5) Google's ""Nexus"" smartphones. Think of the Android operating system inside a Google smartphone... Yikes... 6) Android in smart televisions. I absolutely despise the fact Sony have decided they will only make Bravia televisions with that operating system. Talk about selling-out to surveillance capitalism. It basically means if you want to use the smart features, you require a Google account, and all that data will go to... Yes, Dark Lord Google. There are Sony televisions available last time I checked that do not have Android, but they're dramatically inferior in size and picture quality. To me, this is unacceptable because Google have absolutely no respect for anything other than guzzling data. However, don't despair, because all you have to do is never connect it to the internet.  The operating system is buggy, however, with issues like the volume not showing up, device not switching, and I absolutely hate the fact ""Android"" shows up when turning them on without the ability to turn that off. So, it's a case of dealing with the bugs rather than creating a Google account. Google represents a creepy side to life that can be stopped. All you need to do is stop using their technology and services. In truth, the character limit has prevented me adding more issues.",PL

279,www.google.com,2022-09-23T20:18:07.000Z,1,We listed our home with Shehu Tagoe…,"We listed our home with Shehu Tagoe recently and his presentation before he had our listed was great.  The first offer he emailed us, he was on his way out of town on a personal trip.  He never went over the offer with us and he was out of pocket for 2 days so basically I contacted another realtor friend of mine to explain and go over the offer with us.  There were all kinds of things listed in the offer that should never have been listed in the offer and Shehu Tagoe allowed these items to be listed without questioning the buyer’s realtor and then he emailed it to us to decipher.  My husband and I never accepted that offer because it was not explained to us by Shehu, and we only had a short time to either accept or decline the offer.   We received a second offer from this same buyer who wanted to install flooring in our existing home before the closing on the home ever took place.  We had a real estate attorney draft a clause in Section 20 of the contract to protect us to state that the only way we would allow the buyer to store his flooring in our home and begin floor installation was if he paid 100% of the costs including materials and installation.  The buyer had to provide us with a receipt showing all costs/installation were fully paid for.  The buyer emailed Shehu Tagoe the receipt and he emailed it to us without even looking at the receipt.  The buyer only paid 50% of the costs/installation instead of 100% of the costs.  I questioned Shehu Tagoe regarding this and I said the buyers should have paid 15,000 instead of 7500.00.  Shehu Tagoe responded and said, no all he was responsible for paying was 50% of the cost of the materials not the installation.  The receipt showed 12,000 in materials and just over 3000.00 in labor.  I sent Shehu Tagoe back to Section 20 of the contract and he still argued with me that the buyer only had to pay 50% when it clearly said 100%.  At this point, my husband and I felt like the realtor we hired “Shehu Tagoe” to represent us was working for the buyer and his realtor Stephen Latham.  Shehu Tagoe was fully aware of the intensions of the verbiage in Section 20, and he was adamant that what was written in Section 20 did not mean 100% of the costs but only 50% of the material costs.  Section 20 clearly stated that the buyers had to present us the sellers with a 100% paid in full receipt for all flooring costs including installation, before they ever stored anything in our home.  I began texting and email Shehu Tagoe and I got no response.  Anytime I emailed or texted Shehu, I was ignored.  This went on for days at a time.  I contacted Shehu’s broker “Candace Herring” and explained the situation to her, that my husband and I felt like we were abandoned during this process after the contract was signed, and that I wanted Shehu Tagoe removed from representing us.  She fired Shehu Tagoe from our listing and she said she would handle it through the closing.    Our closing date was moved up to September 1, 2022.  In the middle of closing, Shehu Tagoe came into the closing office right in the middle of our closing to disrupt us and I asked him to leave.  I said your broker has fired you from our listed so therefore you have no right to be here.  He said he could be there if he wanted to and that he was his own boss.  I asked him again for the second time to leave and he refused.  Shehu Tagoe asked the closing agent and she said that decision is left up to the buyers.  After 15 minutes of Shehu Tagoe arguing with us, he finally left.  I have sold 8 houses in my life time and Shehu Tagoe is the worst realtor that I have ever had that represented me.  I would say, even if he was my only choice, I would not ever use Shehu Tagoe as a realtor again.",US

So much so that my family often drives there from Alpharetta. Today was my first negative experience in countless visits and I honestly wouldn't add a review had it not been for the way the manager decided to handle the situation. During the visit I ordered the mac and cheese for my 4-year-old grandson who so happens to love it. After the food is brought to the table my family starts to complain about an unpleasant odor and I noticed my grandson ate everything on his plate except his favorite dish mac and cheese. After smelling the dish and realizing it was sour, we alerted our server who happened to agree with us and also the cook that the dish is not fit for consumption. The manager however didn't think anything was wrong with it and refused to do as little as come over and speak with us about the issue. Be mindful that my tab was well over $100.00 dollars before I added a generous tip to our server meaning I could have gone elsewhere and spent considerably less money and left completely satisfied but I chose this establishment oblivious to the fact that the manager on duty could care less about customer service and customer appreciation. How does a dish unfit for consumption make it onto the table in front of a patron ? Tonight's visit was an epic failure in my opinion, and I don't foresee myself recommending Marietta Fish Market to anyone who thinks business should always value the customer and recognize that it's a privilege to serve them in exchange for the hard-earned money we spend. By the way, The Yard House in Marietta is now my new favorite in the area. Great food, excellent customer service relaxed and welcoming atmosphere along with reasonable prices.",US

I was referred to them by a transplant surgeon to seek the services from a dr. Timothy Prince for after transplant care. I saw him every three months for 10 years (2012-2022). Over the years I read terrible reviews about the practice and specifically about certain staff members and dr. Prince himself. I chose to ignore other people experiences but I behaved like a good little patient all these years. Always attending appointments timely, following medical instructions, taking all the drugs they fed me, and specially being distant but cordial with the staff. Over the years I also heard of patients that left the practice after being mistreated and hurt one way or the other. My number finally came up on August 5, 2022 when I showed up 15 minutes early for my quarterly appointment. I had already informed the practice weeks earlier that I had changed health insurance (as of July 1, 2022), when I arrived, I provided my new insurance card as is expected. The problem started when I mistakenly handed the ID card for drug coverage which is needed only by pharmacies. The front desk staff got very nasty and told me that I needed a doctor's referral (which I never needed before and certainly don't need at this time with my new coverage). They never volunteered to point-out the obvious, that this card was for prescriptions only. They also didn’t bother to communicate that they already had in file my new insurance. Instead, they insisted that I go to my general practitioner to get a referral. I assured them that I would pay out-of-pocket if insurance didn't cover but I needed to keep my appointment and see the doctor as I had not seen him in 6 months and he had previously indicated that the transplanted kidney is not working one hundred percent. After 10 years, they wouldn't budge. I agreed to go to my GP who is only blocks away to get what they were unnecessarily demanding and return with the proof they wanted but I wanted to keep my appointment that day (as Prince is in this office only 4 days per month). As I was leaving the front desk clerk, I had been talking, to yelled at me while leaving at the front door, that referrals ""take 7 days"". The staff at my GP is cordial and helpful and told me right away that I do not need referrals and quickly printed a document from my insurance explaining it. I returned to Nephrologists in less than 15 minutes but they simply were not cooperating in any way. They cancelled my appointment for the day and said I had to wait another week. I reluctantly agreed and left with the  new appointment. Two days later Rosaline, dr. Prince assistant called to cancel my new appointment four days away. She said that Prince was ill; there was no use for me to wait to see him ever again because he was gravely ill and was going to retire. All this on a Tuesday when he had been there four days earlier, on the Friday the day of my original appointment. She gave me names of three other doctors in various locations that could be my new nephrologist. I was so surprised and told her I was sorry and wish the best for Prince and agreed to yet another appointment days away at a new location. I found the entire thing strange and overnight it came to me that they were firing me with the consent of the doctor as this is their practice from multiple comments I had read about them. I proceeded to cancel the appointment with the new unknown doctor.  But, on the day of that appointment at 10:40 AM, I confirmed that the door was in the office, on his death bed presumably, and saw patients that morning including the one scheduled at 11:40 AM, one hour after my cancelled appointment. Now approaching the end of September 2022, I still have not seen a nephrologist since February. The fact that the doctor himself does not inquiry about a 10-year patient is very telling.  Perhaps he is used to patients who just died without him ever inquiring or just go away. He does not care to know. They all just disappear.   I will not let this fade away. I will pursue this with the American Association of Nephrologists and the American Medical Association.",US

One evening I was so frustrated I phoned the office and explained this. I was told that ‘it works’ and try again. I did, and for the rest of that evening I was connected. However, that was the only time I experienced a strong, uninterrupted signal. Every other day, I could not get a connection, or when I did, it would go out in the middle of my work. Room cleanliness was marginal, lighting was poor, bath exhaust fan rattled like bearings were going out, and entry door had daylight coming through the jamb.

Their negligence subsequently resulted in damages to my home and property amounting to several hundreds of dollars and is yet to be fully determined. On 8/10/2022, I called the company main telephone number 832-334-5696 to make an appointment for a service call. On 8/11/2022, an AC technician who identified himself as Bon showed as scheduled. He was cordial and attentive to the problem with the unit. After a bit of small talk, I climbed up the attic access ladder and led him to the location where the air handler is located. He found that there was no float switch present on the pan. I personally made the same observation. He explained that the standard single in-line switch failed due to excessive buildup in the drain line. His assessment was that the water pan overflowed from there not being a secondary safety float switch. He repaired the unit by installing various new parts to include a new pan float switch, surge protector, cleared drain line, and replaced a capacitor at the compressor to the tune of $2,094. I told Bon amount was excessive being that the unit was only 2 years old. Bon asserted that the repairs were not covered by the 10-year warranty due to lack of annual maintenance. I said that no one in the company informed me about the required annual maintenance to retain the 10-year warranty provision in the contract.  Nevertheless, I agreed to have the unit repaired as I was in distress due to the caved in ceiling and other damages caused by the overflow of water from the air handler pan. The falling sheet rock knocked over a new TV set and connected components onto the floor. Immediately after the incident I proceeded to remove the wet sheetrock, carpet and pad because it began to emit a musty foul odor. I set out some floor fans in effort to mitigate further damage. Upon reviewing initial contract, I noticed in the System Enhancements Section, in addition to other items it specified for a WiFi fitted thermostat and two Safety Float Switches which I learned were not installed as per the contract. Then upon inquiring with a city official I found that a permit had not been secured as required.  On 8/12/2022, I called Bon on his cell number 832-731-2803 and asked him if he recalled the events during the service call at my residence of 8/11/2022. He said that he did recall and that he saw that there was no secondary safety float switch present at the pan. I asked him to remind his supervisor to call me to discuss the matter of the water damage. I received no call back. On the same day I called again and was left on hold for over 30 minutes, and again no one responded. On 8/15/2022, I finally got to speak with a telephone receptionist who identified herself to me as, Yareli. I requested to speak to a supervisor about the matter of the damages and filing an insurance claim with the company insurance. She told me that the company does not pay for any damages to the home or property from leaking water. I asked her to please review the contract on her system. She confirmed that there should have been two safety float switches. I mentioned again to her that Bon, the AC technician found only one present. Again, I asked to speak to a supervisor whom she only identified only as Gustavo. She would not provide his last name. She said she would convey my concerns to him and have him call me back. No one called. After numerous calls to the corporate office by 8/17/2022 my efforts to resolve this matter were to no avail. I was getting pretty worried that no one was listening or even cared about my situation. I did some research and found numerous negative company reviews online from dissatisfied customers and lackluster employee customer service. I located a few positive comments, but the negatives by far outnumbered the positives. Now I was really concerned that the company was ignoring the whole matter. I called again on 8/22/2022 and contacted a telephone receptionist who identified herself to me only as Jocelyn. I asked her to please allow me to speck to Gustavo to discuss my situation. She said he was not in the office but provided me an email address where I could communicate my concerns. I did as she asked and sent a message detailing my experience and asking for it to be directed to the owner, Mr. Sam Saleh Makattash.",US

The roots were lifting and causing cracks to my driveway and walkway.  So, I contacted three tree removal companies and Carrick was the second call-back that I received. The first Guy who called me back was SUPER-DUPER, OUT-OF-BOUNDS expensive!  The third Guy was not much lower than the first, but said he would match the second Guy (that would be Carrick).  I decided to go with this third Guy because of his sales pitch.  But as he talked and went on about his services, I realized a few red-flags.  Long story short, I almost didn’t give the job to Carrick because the second Guy sounded so good!  Carrick and his crew showed up on time and finished the job in about three hours.  He kept me informed the whole time and sent me before and after pictures while the job was in-progress (I live out-of-state).  I miss that beautiful, old oak tree, but  it had to go and I’m glad to have chosen Carrick to get ‘er done!  Carrick seems like a no-fuss kind of guy.

There are several serious issues with this hotel AND the Hotel Manager! Why do I say this? For starters: either the first day or second day, I was speaking with a nice female holding down the front desk by herself; she adv me that someone had called out and she had been working since the day before and had been at the hotel working (don't quote me)...I think she told me about 16-hrs.! You could tell she was VERY, VERY tired. She also told me she had tried more than a couple times to contact the hotel manager and was unable! AND...she was also having to clean up the breakfast area, AND watch the front desk!!! For real?!! If you're the manager of a hotel, you need to always be accessible in case something like this happens!!! Turns out the front office manager came in and had to bring her children because from what I was told...she had nobody to watch them. (Is this outrageous or what?!) Overall…the hotel is poorly managed and at times VERY understaffed! And YES…the pictures are mine that I personally took…and they are NOT fake or photoshopped or retouched. The carpeted hallways are dirty and have numerous stains! The carpet in ALL 3 of our rooms was dirty. (We changed rooms TWO times; in total, we had 3 different rooms)! I would NEVER again stay in this hotel! Moreover…the hotel is in disrepair! Our last room STILL…DID NOT measure up to the Hilton and/or Hampton Inn Brand standards! Atleast not the standards that this hotel corp. used to pride themselves on not too many years ago!  The staff working under this manager were very nice, but tired and frustrated. Additionally, I spoke with about six employees and they all told me a similar story of how terrible the hotel manager is!! (how she treats them personally as well as other staff). And NO…I’m not joking! Additionally, I spoke with numerous people staying here and they all agreed with what I am saying here in my review!!! I tried to get to speak with someone in the corporate office…preferably on the board of directors but was given the run around and denied this!!!! For this bad experience...customer no service originally wanted to give me 20,000 points [which if you're familiar with Hilton brand hotels, will very rarely be enough for a free night anywhere!]. I did not agree to this. I demanded that I get my last night (which I paid FULL PRICE for)...be refunded to me! These people who own these big corporations hide themselves and their directors in a very similar way that politicians do!  The disheveled, run down, and not so clean (to put it lightly) condition of this hotel resembled one of these budget motels that usually cost under $70/night. As you can see in the pics I took, even the paint touch up job that was done on the bathroom door is a  HALF *SS job! Instead of taking the door of the hinges (which is easy to do) and repainting the entire door ALL THE SAME COLOR....someone [apparently the maintenance person] did some touch up on the door with a brush (not a sprayer or a roller) and didn't even use the same color! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!!! This type of maintenance is very easy to learn AND to do! For crying out loud...it would be obvious to even a child that this looks terrible!

They listen, suggest, and help you work towards the ideal frame for your expensive artwork. They take great pride in their work and I have never been able to fault their work. They have a good eye for what enhances a painting/photo so you can be assured you will be happy with the outcome otherwise they are more than happy to change things. Corner joints are always immaculate and their frame cosmetics are carefully finished. Price is very competitive and better value than most other Framers in the area.

When I arrived at the hotel (after checking in online hours before my arrival), I still had to go through the normal check-in process. I wasn't greeted as a Hilton Honors member, so I just headed up to my room. When I got to my room, neither of the two-door keys were working so I called to the front desk for help. About 5 minutes later, the maintenance man come up and opens my door with HIS key. He told me it usually takes 5 - 10 MINUTES BEFORE THE KEYS ARE ACTIVATED. WHAT??!! You mean I have to wait outside my room for 5 -1 MINUTES before I can enter the room? SERIOUSLY??!! So, after getting into my room, I go to dinner and come back to get ready for bed. I went to take a bath and discovered my bathtub doesn't have a stopper. I call to the front desk and they can't help me but said they would put in a work order and get the problem resolved tomorrow. Well, today (which is yesterday's tomorrow) when I get back to my room I still don't have a bathtub stopper and the front desk and management team are as helpful as 'a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest.' They can't even find me 'one' bathtub stopper in this big hotel. So, now, even though I want to take a bath, I'm forced to take a shower (which I hate).

We continually checked after signing the contract and found no progress being done on the home and had no communication from the builder until we actually demanded some information.  The first closing date passed and still no communication from the builder, we actually had to get a lawyer to send a letter before we got any response and then it was a “well you can back out and we’ll give you what money you have invested back” of course by then we would have taken a $20,000 to $40,000 thousand loss on the deal due to the price we locked in.

I needed teeth cleaning and wanted to talk about whitening and my old veneers from secondary school. The hygenist told me to basically do my own whitening and not use my dental plan from Cigna and then I was told at my next cleaning, the dentist would look at the chip in my veneers. My gums and the health of my teeth were not really addressed. My appointment was scheduled for the next routine cleaning 6 months in advance at that appointment. Six months later, I needed to reschedule my cleaning and the dentist's review of my veneers and was told that I could not be seen for my cleaning until February as cleanings are always scheduled 6 months out. But I could be put on a waiting list for a sooner cleaning and a separate appointment could be made for the dentist to finally review my veneers. The care is not there and I would recommend another dentist if you are new and need an office that can accommodate a busy schedule within reason. I am a full-time grad student, work full time and have a side gig.  This is dentistry for people who do not have a lot going on and do not have dental concerns and additional services. Do not waste their time and yours if you have a busy schedule, lots of insurance and a savings plan, and dental concerns. My husband also went to them and was charged an extra 200 and some dollars for cleaning with his insurance and had to make a second appointment after his initial visit for the cleaning.

It’s about memories.”   We are beyond shocked and disgusted with the way this company handled our things and spoke to us when we called them to discuss our concerns.  We started our move a day late on June 29th after we were told our truck had broken down en route to us on our assigned moving day. This is one of those unfortunate but understandable events so we just worked extra quickly the next day to get the house we were moving out of packed and tidied up before the new owners arrived. In our initial phone conversations with Sharon from Bold Movers we were told our truck would be a day or 2 behind us to let us get to our destination and be prepared for the truck’s arrival at our rented storage unit.  10 DAYS later, after multiple inquiries, our truck arrived to our storage unit. But it was not our truck. It was a different truck than the one that we had seen being packed with our items in it. During that 10-day period our items had been unpacked and then re-packed into a new truck with no notification or consent from us that this was happening. When the truck arrived to our destination and was opened there were boxes strewn about, toppled over, crushed. Our larger furniture items were laying in awkward positions or on their side with all weight distributed unevenly on fragile legs, armrests, and other delicate areas.   As the 3 men started to unpack our truck it became clear that they did not know how to efficiently and effectively move items.  When we expressed concern about this during our phone conversation that day we were told that “They are in training” as an excuse. But there was no training, the men barely spoke to each other.  There was no working together. They carried huge and heavy items independently, never 2 men to move anything. Heavy boxes and furniture were hoisted up in to the air and thumped down on dollies, or just dropped.  Our large antique chest of drawers was attempted to be pick up by 1 man, turned on its side placing all weight on 2 wooden legs, one of which, unsurprisingly, snapped off. Boxes labeled “fragile” and “this side up” were knocked over and upside down.  Multiple wooden legs of furniture are completely broken off and some we have been unable to find.  Wheels are missing off of antique furniture, we found one wheel on the floor in the actual storage unit.  Both the washer and dryer have large dents in the metal that were not previously there and we actually witnessed one of the movers attempt to move them down the storage facility hallway by violently shaking them back in forth and scraping them along the concrete floor to move them by himself. Boxes were dropped, dragged and thrown despite our begging them to be more careful.  Sadly, after the unpacking began we felt we needed to record and photograph what was happening in front of our eyes. Through our initial shock and disbelief we recognized that this was truly unbelievable and because our only response from the owners was accusatory, condescending and aggressive, we needed to document as much as possible. Thankfully the Manager of the storage facility we booked was just as shocked as we were and she offered to write us a letter documenting what she was seeing and the unprofessionalism she witnessed throughout the move. Not only did the movers break most of our possessions but they also broke one of the security cameras off the wall in the storage facility. In addition to all the damage caused by the carelessness of this company we still have multiple items that are missing and unaccounted for, they were never packed on to the second truck. A few of those items we have pieces of so there is indeed proof that they were initially packed, but we are missing the actual item. As of today, BOLD has NEVER contacted us to make this right.",US

We had been told that it was an amazing place, expensive but the fantastic service and food is what you're paying for. However, when we arrived we stood around for a few minutes before someone greeted us and took us to our table, not overly friendly or welcoming. After looking at the menu we flagged a waiter down to take our orders as no-one approached to take them, the waiter was not friendly, not one smile. But it was our last special family night so we chatted and enjoyed. The entrees came out which were good quality but not great, the oysters in the Kilpatrick were very small. However, that was ok, we were looking forward to our steak, my husband didn't order an entree so he wouldn't be full for the mains. We waited and waited, watching others who came in after us receive their meals. Finally after being there about 1hr and 15 minutes I enquired about our mains, the waiter said she would look into it but never came back, finally I asked another waiter, she finally came back after serving others to say they were coming. More waiting, 10 minutes later I asked the same waiter that took our initial order, not a friendly man, he went off then came back after 5 minutes saying the people across from us had received our meals by mistake and they were going to cook ours up now. we said that was not right, he got defensive, not apologetic and said, what can I say it was an accident and left us. So at nearly 2 hrs since our arrival we decided to leave. When we went to pay for our entrees the waiter at the counter was apologising and saying if we can just wait our meals are on the way but we were sick of waiting and were very hungry. I told her that 3 times I had asked the whereabouts of our meal but no answers came and when we finally got an answer there was no apology at all. She got very defensive, not friendly, and said, well I'm apologising now. I said that wasn't good enough to apologise just when we are leaving. It ruined our special last night out with our son. We could've put up with the long wait if the staff were attentive, friendly and apologetic, but they were not. Unbelievably disappointed. so much for the great service.",AU

It is well understood through multiple online sources that google has been taken over by caste descrimination and the companies refusal to do anything about it is largely to do with the fact that the ceo is caste himself and enforces it because that is how he got is position like all the indian tech ceo's. It is reinforced by the fact that google practise a thing called diversity and inclusion which prohibits staff from talking about the elephant in the room and anything that goes against their interpretation of diversity and inclusion is punishable.  This has resulted in poor qa of their products and services, for example if you search for google caste, the engine will return chromecast products so this attempted hiding of the discrimination by google is evident that the company is trying to mask their caste descrimination. The google assistant is now worse as a result as well. Additionally google is facilitating the exploitation on youtube of kids where parents post daily videos of their kids for money. Such examples include the hurrendouse diana and roma who strangely enough have not even mastered the english language which I find weird considering they have been in the us for years. Another example is ryans world which has been subject to federal investigation over child exploitation. This again just shows the value google has in children, they are commodities to make money and google will clearly go to any lenghts to bring in the revenue. It mirrors indian caste value in children and view them as commodities to better a family name. You cant even effectively block these child exploitation videos because google dont want you block them. Ethics is a huge problem at google, discrimination is a huge problem at google and the sooner indian influence is out of the company, the better.",IE

We arrived for our appointment at 1:30 pm, and asked for the shuttle because we had waited to have lunch until we got there.  Plan was to grab lunch while the Blazer was being serviced to save time to get back on the road to WY.  The service advisor checked me in, and said the shuttle would be 10-20 minutes, and he would come get us in the waiting area.  We went to the waiting area, and waited for an hour and 45 minutes, no shuttle driver ever showed up. The service advisor came to give us the paperwork and said we were ready to go, we said something about the shuttle driver, and he said ""Oh, I don't know where he is, he's not answering my calls""  Well, that doesn't sound like a reason to be concerned.  With an appointment, almost 2 hours waiting on an oil change is unacceptable.  After we left, I was looking at the receipt, which noted that the tires were not rotated because they couldn't find the wheel lock.  No one asked about,or called me since we sat in the waiting room the entire time.  The wheel lock was in the glove box, so they didn't look or care to find it.  Not to mention, its a CHEVY dealership, they don't have wheel locks for their own vehicles?  Since it was the complimentary oil change and tire rotation, they are charging Chevy for the service visit, which seems fraudulent to me, since the service was not performed completely.  When I tried to complete their survey, it wouldn't accept my one-star rating and told me the survey wasn't valid anymore.  How convenient. Guess that keeps the reviews up if you don't accept the true reviews.  This dealership needs to hire more people or book less appointments to actually give service to customers.  Very poor representation for Chevrolet, who I am going to contact as well.",US

I own a Campark T20-1 trailcam that is almost 2 years old (well out of warranty).  Lately, the SD card wasn't capturing any activity.  I thought I'd give it a shot and contacted Campark customer service, detailing the difficulties I've been having.  Campark responded quickly with several suggested remedies; each time saying that they would stand by their product if the remedies failed to fix the problem.  Of the suggested remedies, the one that did the trick was for me to reformat the SD card.  Once I did that, the camera worked like a champ.  Since I only paid about $50 originally for the gamecam, I thought that I was out of luck.  Not so with Campark's super customer service.  Thanks for stepping me through the various remedies.

457,www.google.com,2022-06-29T13:13:52.000Z,1,Review if the Installation of a Sprinkler System,"I requested a quote through Angi for some irrigation contractors.   The first call we received was from J&W Irrigation and Repair LLC (Jesse Metzs).  We received an estimate of 2800.00.  I asked him would a permit be required to install a sprinkler system at our house and Jesse said that the only time you would need a permit for an irrigation system is if you you had a backflow protector system installed.  I said are we not required to have a backflow system and he said no.  I called the City of Tallahassee and they told me that a backflow preventer has been required since 1990 to be installed in anyone’s yard that has an irrigation system.  Jesse Metz is being dishonest when he tells you that you don’t need a backflow, when in fact, it is required by the city for you to have one.  At the end of the walk-through, Jesse asked “how can I earn your business without you getting any other bids?”.  I said if you adjust your bid by 200.00, we have a deal.  We shook hands and we both agreed for Jesse to do our job 200.00 less than the estimate he originally gave us.  The total we were quoted was 2600.00.  There was a mention of adding a timer to the wall on the back of our home but I did not relate that to the irrigation controller.  According to Jesse they are one in the same. I asked if the controller could be installed in our garage and he said yes.  He never mentioned that there would be any additional costs since the irrigation controller had not been installed.  Jesse also mentioned that we could operate our sprinkler system with an app that he would assist us in getting installed on our phones and connected to the internet.  Come to find out the controller we had was not compatible with our Fiber Optic internet, that was a selling point in us purchasing the Hunter X2 controller.  There was no planning, organization or supervision on Jesse’s crew.  Jesse brings his men to your home and he leaves them unsupervised.  Jesse failed to adjust our water pressure before his crew adjusted the sprinkler heads so water was spraying all over our neighbor’s house and in the street.  Jesse also charged us 200.00 more than the agreed upon estimate and Jesse’s explanation was that it cost more to install the controller in our garage versus on the wall on the back of our home.  Not once did Jesse mention to me that this would be an additional cost.  They left mud all over our new driveway and all over our newly painted wall in the garage.  Destroyed all the grass between mine and my neighbor’s house because they used a shovel versus a trencher.  I called Jesse and his crew to come back and reset our sprinkler heads, paint the wall in our garage and pressure wash our driveway.  He said he would come back on Monday.  Jesse and crew came back on Monday.  Jesse never pressure washed our driveway nor did he paint the wall in our garage.  I asked for assistance with the app, he said the only thing I can do is refund you 65.00 for the Wand.  He goes to his truck to get the 65.00 to give us and he comes back and says, I only have 60.00, so that is all that he gave us.  Our irrigation system came with a two-year warranty, that my husband and I will never be able to use, because I will never have J&W Irrigation & Repair LLC back to my home to work on anything.  J&W Irrigation & Repair LLC (Jesse Metzs) will tell you that you do not need a backflow preventer if you have an irrigation system installed, but according to the City of Tallahassee, a backflow preventer has been required since 1990 on all homes with an irrigation system.  An additional cost of 1375.00 to have a backflow installed, extra labor and another irrigation person to come back to our home to complete the work that J&W irrigation & Repair LLC (Jesse Metzs) did not do.  The 1375.00 + 2800.00(install sprinkler) = 4175.00.  We only thought we would have to pay 2600.00 to have a sprinkler installed.",US

After our meals were brought to our table and he had tasted his, he noticed that it was barely lukewarm.  By comparison, my Gumbo was steaming hot.  He went to the counter, brought this to the attention of the  Manager, and simply asked if he could heat the food.   The Manager then went back into the kitchen area and returned after a few minutes to inform him that the ""holding temperature"" of the Italiano was 160-degrees.  (The ""holding temperature"" may have been that, but his was barely lukewarm!)  He did not offer to heat the food, nor apologize for it being lukewarm, and then went on to serve other customers. Had Yats founder Joe Vuskovich been there, I am certain that he would have apologized, heated the meal, or at least offered my husband a hot alternative.  The Manager of the Fishers store needs to go back to Joe for a mandatory refresher course in Customer Service 101.

We were hold here in the airport due to illegal transit in Tokyo Japan which was issued to me by one of the agents in ASAP tickets (ITN). We showed up and everything was set up but then we were hold because of that reason as I mentioned. It wasn't disclosed to us and the ASAP tickets (ITN) agent put the blame on me for not asking questions. As a passenger, I just rely on my travel agent and I believe of what she said, I do believed she is knowledgeable better than me because she is a travel agent and supposed to be give the details of the most important information during our flight.The crew from the Canada Airlines won't allow us to check-in and not to give our boarding pass because of the transit hours in Japan Tokyo for more than 24 hours according to our itinerary and also in return ticket the ASAP tickets (ITN) agent said that I have to use shuttle from Haneda to Narita which denied by the Canada Air staff stating that it is illegal to do that. And I was forced to cancelled  the flight and in return the ASAP tickets (ITN) they took $400 for us (2passengers) which I do believed that it wasn't our fault. We showed up early but we were refused to board because of the ticket that was issued by the ITN. Please kindly resolve and give us our money back in full because I think that it's not fair for us. The travel agent supposed to be explaining everything about the itinerary and not selling that kind of connecting flight which is illegal in Tokyo. I just only found out during our departure.

I booked the cleaning day for 6/13/22 at noon...for a 5 hour deep clean. I received texts from 'Angi' reminding me about my upcoming project.  I answered all the questions I was asked about my home.  I took some time off work so I could be here and go over my cleaning priorities with the 'Pro'.  I received a text that day from 'Angi' telling me my 'Pro' was on the way.  Noon came and went.  No one showed up.  There is a way to call the 'Pro' in the Angi App.  I waited 30 minutes and called. When I did that..the call went through to a calling center of some sort. I explained that I was expecting someone at noon...but no one has shown up.  He asked if I called the 'Pro' to see what the delay was.  I told him I did call and was connected to him. (Plus, it really shouldn't be the customer's job to have to track down Angi's employee).  He said my issue was not handled by his department...so he transferred me to someone else.  I had to explain the whole thing again.  The lady apologized and said she would find out what's going on.  She put me on hold.  When she came back, she said that the 'Pro' has Covid symptoms in her household...so she thought it best not to come.  But, no one at Angi's notified me ahead of time or attempted to fix their sudden staffing problem.  The lady said she could get a different 'Pro' to my house on Wednesday morning at 8am. I told her that was fine.  I could go into work a little late after meeting the 'Pro' and going over instructions.  More of my time wasted...but I needed the cleaning done.  Wednesday morning 8am came and went.  No one showed up.  I waited 30 minutes again and called.  I explained what was going on.  The lady said for me to wait and she would try and find out where the 'Pro' was.  But, she apparently couldn't contact the them.  She asks me if I want to set up a different day.  I told her no.  Because their service was absolutely ridiculous.  At this point, I wouldn't hire one of their 'Pros' to walk my dog.  It is now after midnight...and I am cleaning after working all day.  This is what prompted me to write this review. Their Service Recovery is abysmal and their 'Pros' are the exact opposite of professional.

We purchased a Buick Enclave in September 2021.  After driving it and pulling it behind our motorhome, we decided to trade for a larger SUV which would be easier to tow.   In April, I contacted the salesman we dealt with and explained the situation, and asked him about finding us a Suburban type vehicle with under 150,000 miles we could FLAT TOW behind our motorhome.  He sent me photos of the 2014 Suburban we currently bought from them taking their word it would fit our needs for flat towing.  We had the vehicle for 4 weeks when we attempted to attach it to our motorhome only to find out we could not tow it because it has a single-speed transfer case. This after spending over $700 for new tires and $500 for new tow brackets to attach to the motorhome.  The DEALERSHIP KNEW it could not be towed. The excuse of the salesman only working there about 18 months does not fly, it is their JOB to know the vehicles. I contacted the dealership and spoke with a gentleman who researched for me and called back to inform me we could not tow it for the risk of ruining the transmission.   We are not happy with that and started looking for a vehicle we could use.  I once again contacted the salesman asking AGAIN for him to find us a vehicle we could flat tow behind our motorhome.  He did nothing.  I looked at the Auffenburg site and saw a 2013 Tahoe which would be perfect for our needs.  It was more expensive and we would have been happy to trade for a different one realizing we would pay more for the new one.  Imagine our surprise when we were quoted a bid on our vehicle of over $6,000 less than we paid 6 weeks ago!!!  They also had the other vehicle way over retail value according to the current market.  We would have given a difference of around $6000, but not $12,777.   I would say RUN, do not even think about dealing with these people.  We are seniors and they plainly took advantage of us. I also have confirmation of everything I have said, I have all written contact between the salesman and myself. I have removed the salesman's name to protect his family, even though he felt no need to defend our rights.  This dealership is so dishonest I will continue to give bad reviews.",US

On that day he promised that he will complete the bathroom in three weeks maximum. Because he was so confident and adamant plus he was contracted with our pool company we decided to give him our entire hardscaping project. We signed an additional contract On 01/22/2022 with a start date of 02/03/2022.  On that day he promised that he will complete this project along with the bathroom project in three weeks. WE HAVE PAID HIM AS PER CONTRACT AND ON TIME BUT HE HAS NOT DELIVERED THE WORK AS PER HE PROMISE. Every day, he makes new excuses for no show up and false promises to complete the project. Lately, I have been asking about the deadline of the projects several times but he has not been even responding to our messages or calls. Finally, on May 16,2022 he agreed that he would finish everything by May 31st, 2022. but as usual, no show up no phone call. I am going to sue this company.

It is in a constant state of renovation because it is so old. Our original room (as we were relocated) had a broken sink that was gushing water. We had to go through a lengthy process of attempting to get a new code for our new room. (Be aware that once in the room, there is a key fob, however, that is only for the front door and the elevator, NOT your room...that still requires a code).  In our next room, the shower was moldy and the balcony above us had water leaking off of it in places where it looked to be falling apart...needless to say we didn't want to step out onto our balcony in fear for our lives.  The cleanliness left something to be desired. The biggest problem we had was the lack of safe & secure parking for hotel guests. The parking area was located in a bad part of town in which we saw several questionable characters lingering around. Also, it had a meter that required $5.00 and expired at midnight...who wants to go put more money in at midnight in a questionable area? No staff were found at the front desk because the check-in is done online (which made the process difficult). They require a background check!!! I have never had to do a background check for a vacation stay in my life! However, once you notice the characters hovering around and staying in this place, you will understand (should you choose to stay there...)  We questioned one cleaning staff member about the Mint House, they said that the top floors are for actual residents who pay rent. Also, it is rented out to people for short term stays. The entire operation is sketchy given the looks of the neighborhood it is located in. The pictures on the website were perfect looking...the experience you get is the exact opposite.  If anyone has ever watched the documentary about the Cecil Hotel in CA next to Skid Row...you will not want to stay in this place.

553,www.google.com,2022-05-24T19:23:12.000Z,1,Phil Long of Motor City,"Up front, I will say that if I could give fewer than one star, I would. BUYER BEWARE OF PHIL LONG used car sales. I am a disabled older woman who came into Phil Long to buy a car. I had seen the 2013 Nissan Leaf, an electric car, online and was interested in buying it. I did end up buying it after a test drive and had nothing but problems after that. The charging cable wasn't in the car when I bought it and the salesperson I was working with, came in when I was signing papers to tell me that it had just been ordered and would be delivered by Amazon the next day. That was on a 5/11/22. I drove home from the dealership and the charge was so extremely low on the car it said to charge it. I called and was told again that the charger had been ordered. I waited until Thursday, two days later, and it still hadn't arrived from Amazon so I took the chance and was barely able to drive to a charging station only to find out that I was unable to charge my car there because of its age (the charging cables at the station wouldn't fit the charging port in the car). And now the car would not drive because the charge was critically low. I called the dealership to let them know, and Chris, a manager from Phil Long, came out to see if I was correct about that. I was. He had me get a tow truck to take me home and said the charger would be in that night and that they would reimburse me for the tow. He told me to submit the towing receipt to Nicole, the salesperson, to be reimbursed for the towing expense. The charging cable didn't come in that night, or the next, or the next. I was unable to charge the car until Sunday. Which seems to be, perhaps, the point of their delay, as I was now past the 3 day/150 mile exchange guarantee they offer. I charged the car for two days solid at my daughter's house and it never went above 44 and dropped immediately to forty-one when I rolled it back out of the driveway to park on the street. It's supposed to charge to at least one hundred (per the manager, Chris) but doesn't come close to that, topping out at actually forty-one. I went back to the dealership and saw Chris, who just kept saying, ""You chose this car."" As if that would get the dealership off the hook for responsibility. I trusted that the dealership would give me a sound vehicle, not just push their problem off onto a disabled woman. When I asked if no one had checked the charging potential, he said of course they did. But apparently no one thought it was a good idea to tell me that the drive battery was bad, and that the most I'd be able to drive would be thirty-five miles on a charge, if I was lucky. Or that I wouldn't be able to charge at an EV station without a $100.00 adapter. Every time I asked different questions about that battery, (which costs $5,500.00 to replace) Chris would sidestep around the issue, never giving me a direct answer, just deflecting. I don't have the money to replace the faulty battery, and there is no way that the EV lot of Phil Long could not have seen that the charge wasn't going past forty-one when they charged it up. I was sold a car that can't function like it should, with no advance warning that it couldn't be driven even around town before having to charge it, (and the car cannot be charged at regular charging stations) or the information that to actually drive the car I would have to pay for another battery at a price that is prohibitive. My understanding is that when cars are sold they have to be in drivable condition which, for an EV, would mean a battery that is sound. Chris told me that I could put more money down and get another vehicle with a payment of $350.00 to $400.00 per month. I am, again, older, and disabled, and I would in no way be able to afford a payment in that range, hence why I was looking at a used vehicle priced at $7,600 dollars. Shame on you Phil Long Ford for taking advantage of an older, disabled woman and not telling the truth about the problems with the vehicle you were selling.",US

Federal Way, WA 02 	5/21/2022 Our water heater flooded our master bathroom and our master bedroom as well as a small part in our garage. We found Luis Casillas Construction company on line after our insurance told us they could not recommend anyone because they had not contracts with anyone in our area. It was lucky for us that it happened that way.  Luis came in and took a look at the areas and said he was unable to do the work until we had another water mitigation company come out and make sure things were done properly, because from he could tell it had not.   We called south sound water recovery to give a second opinion and found that the first company that the insurance had sent did not dry our home as it should had been done in the first place.  That led to another two weeks of demolition and drying in our home. Once that was completed Luis came back in and was super helpful.  I trusted him because he was right about the first company and really had our interest at heart. He was always communicating with us and making sure that we knew every step of the way what was going on and the plan. If product we ordered came in and had any issues he was sure to share that information immediately. He was extremely busy but was able to get us on his schedule and he worked night and day between us and other jobs he had on his schedule. He still always did a quality job on everything.  We appreciate his quality work and his professional manners! In this day and culture were company's are going more toward that the customer is not right, Luis is still a respectful and caring to the value of money and the work that he performs.

Said panel is around 65 dollars. Was told that since the trailer is in production I had to order the entire kit. (350.00). Then was told by Jim that it needed to be ground shipped from the factory, (which is in Indiana) and the cost would be around 75 dollars or so. Mind you I'm in Indiana working and was never given the option to go pick it up. So weeks go by and no call from Jim. So I call and was informed that the kit arrived but was left on the truck. I was given attitude by Jim for calling. Then I get a call the following week and Jim tells me my shower kit has arrived. I get to the facility and was told he was out to lunch and come back in a couple of hours. I'm ok with it, every one has to eat. Dude man shows up, doesn't introduce himself and then presents me with a bill of 475 dollars plus. I was told it was shipping cost. I believe I was double charged due to their negligence of not offloading the shower kit. Then the man has the audacity to ask me to help load it on my truck. So over a thousand dollars later, I get a shower panel that I needed that only cost around 65 dollars or so. just telling you all, to stay away from this place. Buyer beware",US

Local jewelry stores did not have what we wanted, so we reviewed on-line stores and chose rarecarat.com. It was an amazing experience. Ajay, the founder of the company, and his team of expert gemologists made the whole process of choosing the perfect ring easy and enjoyable. We read the diamond education provided on the web site and learned about what makes a truly quality diamond. Rarecarat has a consortium of top jewelers offering a world-wide market of incredible diamonds. We were no longer restricted to what the jewelry stores had to offer, and we learned how to choose a great quality diamond at a great price. We searched the world-wide selection of diamonds for months and then we found it - the spectacular diamond we were looking for! We chose a colorless heart cut 1.24 carat diamond of excellent quality at an unbelievably good price. We also purchased a gorgeous diamond setting and matching wedding band from one of the jewelers on the site, Helene Mitchell. The diamond is cut so perfectly that it sparkles like the sun! I also want to commend rare carat for outstanding customer service. Ajay and the expert gemologists were there every step of the way, 24/7 to answer all of my questions, inspect my diamond, and even help with delivery options. Rarecarat suggested that we have the diamond independently appraised, and it appraised for nearly double the price we paid! The whole experience was incredible, and we have been spreading the word about this awesome company. A big thank you to Ajay and the team for making this dream come true for us!",US

Prior to surgery 4-11-22, I was eating baby food for about 4-5 months. MM has been my saving grace, because of degestive disorder, I was unable to digest properly, foods, meds, etc... These things were not reaching my cells. Un-able to do do regular meds, I was forced to spend astronomical amounts of money for 3 years on experients with mm. On 4-8-22 (beginning 3 days of clear liquids) I purchased several products, all marked indica RSO online. Remember, surgery 4-11-22,. And remember, because, I've gotten burned prior by ethos, i always ask before leaving the store, all striaght indica, right.? Which, always, I'm told yes, There is clearly a high turnover, the employees do not know the product. However, once I looked at package upon ready to use the product, only to find out, the back shows as a hybrid. Any type of sativa in the product prevents me from sleep, can't achieve, and certainly can't stay asleep. I have insomnia due to medical condition, While trying to return them, the person waiting on me was pretty cool, got a manager, this is where is fail apart. Again, I've been doing this in PA since is opened, so I have learned what does not and does not work. He supposedly explained the situation prior to coming to the floor. Not so, I had to repeat myself in front of the whole stole. So of course being a manager, he had to insist to try and contradict me by saying not all growers do not incidate (I) if it is indica, unless a knew grower, that has not been my experience; anythime I received a stright Indica, It was alwasys marked indica on my name label next to product name, if it was straight indica. I have insomnia, so imperitive must be straight indica. Not just what it says on their sight. Online is wrong many times, that has been my experience. Manager at store, feels he must explains this to me, now, remember I am only 3 weeks out from a serious surgery. All I want is an exchange.No other explanation needed. They made a mistake, I wanted it corrected. Neither package was tampared. No attempt to be open, name tags and labels still affixed. At this point, I'm not feeling well, a female patient, right next to me, feels the need to interject her own personal feelings, saying I was being rude.I have an exicitable voice when I am being attacked by other, Gang up as you will. People in todays world feels they have that right.  Rude is not always rude, it is sometimes authority from an adult in the situation, to the employee not doing there job. I will advocate for myself. Simply because the manager did not like what I saying,I was not the one being rude. Having authority as a adult is not rudeness. At one point the security got involved, we were outside and the rude interfering so called patient was still putting her 2 sense in and the security would not stop her from instigating and would only shut me up. Again, manager was extremely upset at the behavior at the the manager on site and the security. 2 very important things, this is not a medical facility. They're is no anonimity, no partitions in between patients, not seperated at all (literally 2 feet apart), everyone can hear what everyone else is saying. They made sure to repremand me in front of others: the female, 40 something, unkept, is allowed to interject her own personal feelings, where I was being silenced. This woman had no right to interfere. I was clearly not being rude, I actually had a very lenghtly conversation w/ an offsite manager, anout 1 hour later, who will look into to this, train and reprimand her staff. She stated, this should never happen, have another patient interfere, w/o a manager stopping her. This is clearly what escalated the situation; manager has every intentions of reviewing tapes, which I invite, I WOULD RATHER GO ELSWHERE, MY MONEY SPENDS EVERYTHERE. ETHOS HAS NO RESPECT FOR THE PRIVACY OF THE PATIENTS as a a business at all. It shoud just call itself a recrecational mm place, although not legal, but clearly the legimate patient is in the  back burner at this place. If you want to be treated as an actuall patient and not a pot head, stay away from this facility. You go out to parking lot, there are 4 teenagers in the the car while one goes in and gets there get-high, I've seen it and also heard of many instances of this take place, Has nothing to do with medicine. Happens all the time, many, may times. More young people on MM then should be allowed. This industry has become a joke. Patients who really need the medicine can't actually get the medicine because there is so much abuse in the industry, going to people who just want to get high, its just getting to the patient who actually needs it, not enought product around.

Within weeks, we heard unusual cracking sounds from floor.  Within a month or two, tiles began to make popping sounds.  We filed a Tile Install Warranty Claim in Nov 17 '21 & received a Warranty Work Order (WO)#.   After we made several calls each week thereafter to follow up, in Dec'21 Lowe's (contractor) visited the house & confirmed ""there are issue(s) that need to be addressed"".   Between that mid Dec'21 visit and Mar'22, we received no follow up calls from Lowe's, so we continued to call every few days.  Each time we called, we had to educate a different Lowe's representative who was unfamiliar with our claim & escalate calls to 'managers' - speaking to 2 or 3 (different) people each phone call.  We finally learned that Lowe's had closed our original WO, in spite their contractor inspecting install & determining that warranty claim was valid.  Not only had they closed our original Nov17'21 WO, but had opened & closed several additional WO's since.  This seems to be a way to ""Play with their internal performance metrics"" &/or a method to confuse / frustrate / distress & ultimately wear-down their customers trying to maneuver through a difficult & lengthy warranty process.  Mid-Mar'22 we finally had to involve Better Business Bureau (BBB), Dept of Justice & other 3rd party agencies to review our case & concern with Lowe's warranty support.  This triggered Lowe's to assign a Lowe's Executive Customer Relations rep to our warranty claim & the re-inspection of the install at our home.  However, even though we have been able to work with ONE Lowe's rep - which has tremendously improved the warranty process - as of this writing (Apr29'22) there is no viable date to address our warranty install issue(s). Terribly frustrating, disappointing & stressful 5+ month warranty encounter with Lowe's.  AND it's not over yet!",US

She said it could stay there, it would not pose an issue. Five days later I explained to her t that the pain has still not subsided and now my face is swollen, even after being on amoxicillin. She reluctantly gave me pain meds. Here it is 3 months later and 4 different antibiotics, my face is still swollen and in pain and she refused to refill my prescription. My sinus has been infected since the removal. I finally saw an Oral and maxillofacial surgeon who was just appalled at the fact that this Dentist and Dossett Dental let this go on for so long.

Alarmingly the first button I would think of to do this on Google photos... Free up more space...deleted photos and videos that had been backed up on Google photos off my DEVICE. I was so alarmed I and distraught now I had to pay for more space on Google photos so to preserve my photos and videos. It costs £16.99 /but this cost just goes up exponentially as you will always have more photos and videos.  Ps amazon backs up photos for free if you have prime. OK so fast forward to renewing my subscription.

My dentist there referred me to Elevations Endodontics for an evaluation to determine if I needed a root canal. This was toward the end of the day and I was just glad to be seen by the specialist. But after a careful examination including X Rays to determine both the cause of the pain and the specific tooth, Dr Kersten performed the root canal. He and his assistant, Isabel, stayed after hours to perform the surgery. I could not believe the great service I received here. Isabel explained all the new equipment they were using and how the procedure would go while waiting for Dr Kersten to finish up with his last patient. They could have easily sent me home and had me come back during business hours, but the Dr and his assistant stayed late to make sure I was not sent away in pain. The procedure went as others have reviewed - better than most fillings go! They showed me the X Rays taken during and after the procedure so I could see what was actually done. Isabel is a relatively new hire and she and the doctor were flawless in working together to perform this procedure on a complicated tooth. A great team; both very knowledgeable and highly professional.  I wholeheartedly recommend Elevations.",US

On top of that our driveway is on an incline which caused all of our stuff to shift forward in the POD and we had a lot of trouble getting it open and when we did, we had to work the stuff out, so it did not collapse on top of us.

ONE. You made the decision without consent to send additional staff to site, then you did not discuss it with me once you all arrived that I would be charged for all the attending guys and THEN you didn't say anything to me when you completed the job At no point have you approached this issue professionally. You have not had any verbal or written confirmation or approval of the charges. Therefore I will only pay what I endeavour to be fair and suitable for the job done. In comparison to other charge out rates from other electricians and the invoice received and paid for the repair of the internet cable, which was also damaged - how can you justify the amount you charged when your fee is 10X more than what I paid to another electrician for his services? Both the power cable and the internet cable were in the same place, damaged at the same time and yet it took 2 guys (one being an apprentice) less than 1.5hrs to recable the internet all the way to the house. You and your 3 men didn't even cable all the way to the house. You only repaired from the break to the green box up on the curb and it took 4 guys over 3 hours!!!!!!! NO WAY. I will pay you for the same amount of time it took the other electrician to do the repairs of the other cable, and for the same length of time with the same amount of staff.  2 guys for 1.5hours. That's it. If you had taken less time out from talking and smoking this wouldn't be an issue. Perhaps next time discuss all of the above with your client beforehand. At this point you don't have a leg to stand on as I never agreed to anything bar having one guy attend my property to assess the job. You have no verbal or written quote and I have every right to dispute such ludicrous charges. I have endeavoured to make you see sense and send me a new invoice but you have ignored those attempts so now my last and final offer is this; 2 guys for 1.5 hours... at your ridiculous rate of $226 per hour. $678.00 GST ex. That is still over 2 times the amount I paid for the other electrician but to put this to bed I will pay this amount. Send me an invoice for this amount ($753.33 this will be an inclusive of GST rate mind you) and then I will wipe this whole saga from my memory. This has not been a pleasure at all.

Sure the waits were long, and sometimes the staff would ignore us and serve others first but we waited. But recently, their lack of customer service and drink quality HAS gone down. They were really rude to. Maybe they are trying to be nice now, but my experience was awful.   There are actually quite a few more honest reviews about this place that would have helped me make a better choice about where I buy my drinks from.  They are lying. Every negative review seems to be topped up with a few extra positive ones and this pattern is undeniable.  A certain user, John Doeman (apologies if your name is wrong), said something similar (among quite a few others) and the shop replied: please do not visit again. The shop will not tolerate your entitled attitude and blatant racism! Goodness! That only discourages me even more. The dude was literally asking for the high quality drinks that they usually serve, which now seems like they themselves have much lower standards than I first thought. Furthermore, I do not think acknowledging the Chinese origins of that shop is racist. They were only trying to cover up themselves by shifting the blame because they couldn’t deal with those comments that were indeed true!  SHARETEA can we get some less hate here on the internet? We’ve got enough of that. If that is our experience, we are speaking the truth from our point of view; if you make it unpleasant then tell us we’re horrible people for sharing our experiences for the benefit of others to make more informed choices, you’re going to end up with a lot less customers very quickly.",AU

Also causing headaches really bad and throbbing nerve pain! Dr. Roy cracks a joke about my last name being famous because it's James Brown!

We rang our BCC on the Wednesday evening and asked if they knew how old the hot water system was as it was leaking. They advised us to look on the side of the system as it will have a manufacture date.We did this and the date was 1997 (the system was 25 years old). I immediately contacted the Black Dog plumbers Sunshine Coast QLD on Thursday for a quote to remove and install a new system. I accepted the quote. The system had to be ordered and would be installed on Monday 28/3 or if they had a cancellation, it would be installed on Friday 25/3.The plumber advised us not to worry about having the hot water system or the water turned off even though the system was leaking. In the early hours Friday morning the system blew. The result being: Carpets in walk in robe and two bedrooms were soaked . Also three units below suffered water damage and ceiling damage. In relation to insurance: The Strata building insurance does not cover carpet, if the lot owner wants to claim they have to claim this under the lot owners contents / landlord insurance *The strata insurance would cover the repair to the ensuite ceiling. However there is a large excess we will pay as we’re responsible for all the damage to all the units. The moral of this review is don’t rely on a qualified plumber from Black Dog plumbing Sunshine Coast QLD to advise you as it obvious that the person they sent did not act in accordance to procedures when a valve is leaking. If they had we would not be incurring the extra expense. Amazingly we did not even receive an apology.

For personal reasons & new home, I wanted a new account. I did not expect new account sign-up bonus. The old account was not active. When I finished signing up for youtube tv, it did tell me new sign-up specials wasn't available. No problem. Everything was processed easily with the new email, payment method, & TV hook-up. I did not use old information associated with the previous account. We were careful. Billed immediately for the new account with correct billing method. Five days later youtube pulled another   $64.99 out of my bank (both transactions out of my bank account-first cleared 5 days before second) using my old information.  Why? (this is why you should not have your payment method on file!) Both amounts cleared my bank. Google/YouTube will not give me the customer service I need to correct this - only worthless forms.  All I could find was a dispute form. Only allows 100 characters for explanation!! Only 1 transaction date & amount. Minimal space for major problems. No matter how it's abbreviated, you can't explain most situations in 100 characters. In my case, add the need for 2 transactions dates, amounts taken, & by 2 methods. So naturally after they ""investigate"" they come back with NO REFUND because they can't find anything. Duh! They never asked for any bank proof or any more information to substantiate my claim. Just a flat no refund. Then their email of course is a no-reply email. There is nothing in the email to assist you if you need further help. Nothing! Only option is do another dispute form, which I did and expect the same response. A stolen 64.99 is a lot of money for a DAV on SS.  I went back & looked all over google & youtube again to find a phone number or some form of true customer service. None on either site. Web search phone numbers I did try were ""busy"". Online comments indicated same problem. Found 1 I thought might get me somewhere but after blabbering directed me back to online information for nonapplicable situations & hung up. Nothing that allows for proper customer service in situations where you HAVE to talk to someone. Probably figure most people will give up & they get to keep the money.  Since there is absolutely no way to get a hold of anyone at google/youtube it's not safe having payment method attached to account.  On youtube, I did find a ""request for a refund"" form. Of course, it doesn't ask for details either, only a couple of questions, & we'll get back to you later. No way to give details & proof. The closest choice I could check off was ""I didn't mean to sign up"" but I DID NOT SIGN UP WITH THAT ACCOUNT! I did not authorize charges on my bank card! At some point in last 30 days, I believe I did try to remove old payment method (other accounts as well) because I no longer wanted that card used anywhere but google wouldn't let me remove it.  Since there was no new member benefit, after setting up the new account all the way through to payment, the old account had to be detected. If that's the case, why didn't the old account reflect the new account had been FULLY PAID FOR and not take another 64.99 out of my bank 5 days later with my old payment method? Could it be they knew I could never get my money back? Tonight I did manage to get my card off of google which will stop them should they decide to activate my old account & charge again,  Problem is now I can't buy anything where I used to use google. But I just can't risk google going off charging again in the future. Especially now I know there is no customer service at all. The dispute form is a joke & that's all the human (actually probably computer-generated) contact I found.  With not being able to actually talk to someone and explain what they did to me, I have a feeling I won't get my money back. Unless it's from my bank. I did file a dispute since google didn't really investigate. Even on the bank form, I couldn't provide an explanation. Just answer basic questions. Seems my only course of action is to warn others & we're looking into other cable services that actually have a customer service in the event one is needed. These ""online no customer service companies"" are becoming a major problem. Gives more meaning to shop local.",US

The condition of this location was unacceptable for the premium pricing being charged by this location. The breakfast was not palatable, and the overall conditions of the Suite was horrible. This location has not reinvested in the property at this location and the room pricing for a stay here is frankly overpriced. The staff was respectful and kind but the management of this location is practically nonexistent. This is not a premium hotel by any means and it is severely over priced. I paid over $1200.00 for a 3 night stay where I received Motel 6 like services. I do not mind paying premium prices for premium services but this is surely not the case here as this was a (40th Wedding Anniversary). This place is simply awful.

It was not so much the food if we are being incredibly honest, although I did return deserts because I just just didn’t feel they were as expected, but the service in my personal opinion, and also my parents and everyone at the table was shocking. I don’t know if they have had a turn around of staff but it was incredibly lacklustre, lack of basic waiting training and at sometimes it seemed the staff just didn’t want to be there. I’m never impressed when I see a congregation of waitresses constantly standing around the till area and we are constantly having to flag attention to ask for drinks, sundries and basic restaurant formalities. I’m also never impressed when waitresses pass drinks across someone physically eating a meal, spill sauce all over our cutlery from (what seemed like nerves of stacking plates at the end of an course) but what really upset me was when we had deserts delivered, the blond waitress literally dropped a desert on the table looking like she just didn’t want to be there and it was a chore, not her job, we never saw her smile once all night. I won’t complain about the food as I feel this would be unfair, but I do expect a basic level of service and attention when dining out and because of this I would not be returning.",GB

That was a tuesday, drove the vehicle less than 20 miles until the following thursday morning we left Mesa, AZ for Santa Maria, California.  On I-10 West just past Avondale, AZ suddenly had a couple of warning lights come on including pre-collision, traction control, and a check engine light.  Pulled off the freeway as soon as possible, then I notice there is smoke coming from the engine compartment.  Turned off the vehicle, opened the hood, and there are visible signs of red fluid all over the top of the engine and the underside of the hood.  Thought it might be coolant, although my temperature gauge was reading normal and the overflow tank was also in the normal fill range, and the smell was more like transmission fluid. Called Chris at Joe's Auto to let him know the situation, did not want to drive the vehicle any further at that point.  Said he needed to contact the owners for approval to have a tow truck sent out.  I then called Avondale Toyota and they said they could have a flat bed sent out within a half hour or so; hoping not to waste the whole day, decided to have the vehicle checked out at the Toyota dealership.  Never did receive a call from Joe's Auto in Gilbert, AZ, always had to call them.  Turns out the transmission fluid was overfilled as per the Toyota service tech (sealed transmission with no dipstick for me to check levels) and, once the fluid got hot from driving approximately 40 miles, it purged all over the inside of the engine compartment and soaked some of the sensors and wiring which caused the warning lights.  Never received a call back from Joe's Auto in Gibert, AZ and had to repeatedly call them with updates, as well as inquiring whether they were going to offer any refund or financial compensation.  The cost of the towing, along with the diagnostics and service done at Avondale Toyota was $458.50, and that's in addition to the 60k mile service done at Joe's Auto in Gilbert, AZ, which was $365.43  The service done at Joe's Auto in Gilbert caused the problem I should never have had, and they have not been what anyone could call customer service friendly in any way, despite said reviews.  It's easy to take credit when things go right, but Joe's Auto in Gilbert, AZ evidently doesn't take responsibility when things go wrong.  I brought a copy of the service invoice from Avondale Toyota to Chris for him to forward to the manager and owners; I have had to call repeatedly to inquire about any information from them, and whether they were going to make things right.  I was seriously expecting a refund of the amount I spent at Avondale Toyota, but would settle for the lesser amount spent for the original service done at Joe's Auto in Gibert, AZ if they were remotely interested in providing customer satisfaction.  EVIDENTLY NOT !   Why would I ever go back to Joe's Auto in Gilbert, AZ when they don't stand behind their work ?  More importantly, why should anyone else ?!  That is a lot of money for anyone to spend on a 60k mile service, and it was entirely preventable with a little attention to detail and quality control.  I wish I could give Joe's Auto in Gilbert, AZ a zero (0) rating.  Oh, did I mention I still have a check engine light which comes on and goes out at random intervals ?  Needless to say, I'm feeling like a stirred up hornet's nest !",US

Having always had bissell carpet cleaners I was expecting something of a similar standard. How wrong was I! This machine is a piece of rubbish with no peer at all to lift any fluid. In fact my carpet looked worse after I used it than before. I have tried contacting Bissell as I want to return it for a full refund as it is not fit for purpose but as I had received the machine over three weeks before I needed to use it (my dogs don’t often have accidents) all Bissell have done is offer to repair it. I mean seriously it’s a brand new machine that does not do what it’s meant to. Stay away and don’t waste your money,GB

From the moment we arrived, Manager Anthony greeted us and explained all the steps very well to us. He is very professional and helpful. We then met with sales rep Nick. Nick did a great job on the test drive of the XC 40. He was friendly, knowledgeable and very willing to assist us. After we made the decision to purchase the car, we met with finance manager George. George was so personable and found ways for us to save money by explaining what would benefit us and what isn't necessary. He is a very honest man and also a great story teller. After leaving George, we finished off the day with Alec. His job was to show us all the things this amazing Volvo can do. He spent over 45 minutes with us setting up our Volvo app on the phone, creating our profiles, and showing us how the car operates. I have never had a dealership put so much effort into ensuring the customer is comfortable and knowledgeable about the car they are purchasing by having a dedicated person to assist and instruct us. When we left, we felt we had a good grasp on the technology of this XC 40. That's a great feeling. I definitely recommend the folks at Beyer's. The atmosphere there is relaxed and we never felt pressure. It was a friendly environment. Thanks Beyer's!",US

886,www.google.com,2022-02-02T11:11:36.000Z,2,FRAUD DELL SERVICE & FAKE ALLEGATIONS,"This is a customer from UK, I have taken a new dell laptop on February 2020. My service tag number is 46Q9F63. During my use, the laptop suddenly hanged and got a flickering screen again and again. I then registered for a complaint about the same issue on 19th December. The dell support assistant nearly took 10 days to examine my laptop online by seeing the videos and the images sent by me on their WhatsApp. Later they confirmed that it was a motherboard issue and display issue. I am wondering how can a brand-new laptop which is not even used for a year can get issues like this.  They managed to repair it for about 20 days and sent me back on 20th Jan 2022. I opened the repaired laptop and found that the repair receipt said that display, motherboard, Wlan, bluescreen, LCD flickering has all been repaired and replaced with new things. I tried to use it just the next day on 21st Jan and found that the mouse pad had suddenly got sunken on right side and the right-side click was not working properly. I immediately did the video recording and sent it to the dell support team, to which they asked me to pack up the system and send for a repair. I managed to pack it up on 21st night and waited for the UPS team to pick it up. The UPS picked it on 24th Jan.  Now today dated 01/02/2022, the dell team has sent an email saying that the laptop has functional fault and listed so many things such as display is broken, palm rest is broken, extension board error and heatsink overheating. I am wondering that how can a laptop which is been repaired by the own dell team and replaced with new parts, can spoil or malfunction so soon? I have used it for just 1 day and reported only mouse pad issue, but to my surprise, the laptop has got so many issues. They are writing to me that I need to pay £259.59 for all of these, though my warranty is still 3 days away to expire.  This is a complete fraud case of cheating the customers and sucking the money from them, for no fault of theirs. Firstly, a dell laptop which is not even a year old, has malfunctioned. Secondly the repair team has damaged all the inner parts during the repair of my laptop and thirdly they are trying to suck my money for their faulty product. Paying £730 for the laptop and getting such a faulty product is really disgusting.  This will be a case of cheating and fraud for playing with the customers.   I had never expected a dell laptop to be so low quality and the service to be so worst. I suggest all the readers to never buy a dell product again. Instead go for some other brands which at least gives a good replacement for any defective products. WHEN I GAVE THE LAPTOP FOR SECOND TIME, THE LAPTOP HAD NO ISSUE EXCEPT THE MOUSE PAD SUNKEN. Now they are listing so many defects and charging me 250 pounds. This is a complete cheating and fraud. Dell team is trying to put fake charges on my laptop and suck my money.  I am going to sue them for this for what they are doing me. I am not going to pay any chargers for no fault of mine.",GB

Resurgia better known as House Doc has been our choice of care for over five years. Dr. Mark Bradshaw has taken good care of my mom. They offer Nurses, Nurse practitioners, Social workers, Physical therapists, Occupational therapists, Podiatrist, in-home x-rays, and in-home bloodwork or labs. This service has really been a help to my family while caring for our loved one, a ventilator patient. at home. This week-end mom started to experience a reaction to her Duo-Neb, breathing treatment. We stopped it and contacted the on-call service. This is when we were introduced to Dr. Nicholas Caputo. He was great. First of all, he called us back right away, he was compassionate, caring and concerned for my mom. It was on a Saturday, and he was very patient, not rushing us off the phone or rude at all. He ordered one of each of the medications listed we had concerns about and suggested I try each one, one at a time while observing her closely.  We learned the Albuterol medication was causing her oxygen and heart rate to drop. This was obvious after one to two seconds. And the medication was immediately stopped.  Her heart rate and Oxygen returned to normal in a few seconds. The change was enough for us to have concerns.  I want to say thank you to Dr. Caputo., I strongly feel his order of treatment helped to save my mom's life. You see she gets regular breathing treatments. If we had not discovered the allergy was related to the Albuterol treatments.  she would have gotten it again when traveling in the ambulance. The change can be so sudden and drastic, I am not sure if she would have recovered from that treatment. One of the services we use for her travels to and from the hospital ONLY USES Albuterol for breathing treatments. If a patient is in distress and needs treatment, they do   just that. Give them a treatment. This information was life saving for us. It is upsetting to think about what could have happened. I will continue to carry her Ipratropium in my backpack when she travels for back -up all while informing her health care providers making sure they are aware of the new Albuterol allergy. Dr. Caputo also did not hesitate to help us when I had to call him the second time because the Walgreens we use was closed on last Saturday. He graciously called me back to say he was sending the prescription to the next near-by Walgreens and that he would keep the phone nearby just in case I had any other problems. Who does that.? I was and continue to be impressed with the care we received in such a timely manner.  My mom is alive and well and my family and I again say THANK YOU for your compassionate care for your patients especially at a time like this, we are truly Blessed you are a part of our team. God Bless you and all the Resurgia family. By the way, our nurse Bradly is pretty terrific too! Great teamwork.",US

My car was taken back to be worked on and almost 2 hrs later, the counter lady calls me up and begins to tell me that my tire cant not be repaired because the nail was too close to the sidewall and the tread was too low. Keep in mind, I bought all 4 tires from the same store 2 yrs prior. She then proceeded to pull out an invoice and tell me that because my car is all-wheel drive, I can't just replace one tire, I had to replace all 4. So not only could my tire not be repaired but I had to buy a set of new tires. She then says, let me see what I can do and punches something into the computer and says, one new tire would be about 50.00. I reply I will take the one tire, she then says, you cant just change 1 tire on an all-wheel-drive, I have buy all 4. My boyfriend, who is a mechanic, says that it's B/S and advises the lady to put my tire with the nail back on and we will take care of the issue elsewhere. The next day I took my car to a local tire shop and explain to him, that there is a nail in my tire and that I was advised that it could not be repaired and I needed a new tire. The guy offers to take a look a the tire and see what he could do. After minutes, the guy says the tire can be repaired and that the tread is not worn down.  He tells me that I have at least 15,000 miles left on my tires. The guy then tells me that all 4 of my tires were bled so that they would wear out faster. He corrects the air pressure in all my tires and repairs the damaged tire.  I have never been more disgusted and mistrusting with a business as I am with Firestone now.

Mike arrived at my home promptly, wearing a mask and in a very short space of time, I was up and running.   My boiler was one of the more complicated ones yet he worked through the installation quickly. Once installed he demonstrated the device, linked up my phone and my wifes phone to the Nest thermostat and then hooked it up to my Alexa for voice control. Simply, the device is brilliant and links up to your local postcode weather and your home desired temperature - for heating and hot water and thereafter learns in the 1st week what your preferences are. So clever. When we both leave the house, it automatically turns down the temperature and when it sees your phone arriving close to home, turns up the temperature. Its controlled on the wall and on your phone but is constantly self learning. It takes a lot nowadays to impress me but between Nest and Mike - I am very impressed. Simply, if you dont have one - get one...and Mikes price is very reasonable. Yours faithfully Mitch Herber Catalyst Design & Print",GB

During that stay, my daughter woke up with bites on both arms. I didn’t complain at the time of my visit because I didn’t recognize what had caused them. I took pictures and over the next few days showed them to several medical professionals, who all independently agreed that the bites were clearly from bed bugs. On January 17th, I emailed the Regional Manager, Timothy L. Armitage, to explain the situation. With no due diligence of any kind, he denied (in barely coherent language) that the bites were from bed bugs, and theorized that my daughter had an allergic reaction to something pet-related (from a previous customer) in the bed. Even if he was right, it means the bed wasn't properly cleaned. But in reality, he made no effort to actually look into it, and was making something up just to get me to go away.  The hotel cleaned the room after I left and then had it inspected by Orkin, so that by then there was nothing to find. Timothy used that result to conclude that the hotel had done nothing wrong (even though his own theory about an allergic reaction to pet products was barely any better than the bed bugs).  The handling of the situation was not acceptable in my opinion. I had to throw away my suitcase and some other items to avoid infesting my home, on top of the unsatisfactory aspect of the stay itself. IHG, the owner of the Holiday Inn brand, has prominently on their website: ""With the IHG Clean Promise, guests are reassured that: Good isn't good enough – we're committed to high levels of cleanliness."" The issue for me isn't so much the bed bugs as how the matter was handled. Things happen, but the response did not live up to my expectations or the expectations stated by the company.",US

I was thinking about getting a new car soon, but was forced to get one a lot sooner, due to the accident.  I left a message for Jennifer Pratt at Classic Kia in Waukegan, telling her my dilemma, and that I would stop by the day to speak with her.  I had worked with Jennifer previously, and she was very helpful, so I called her to assist.  I did some research as I know cars are hard to come by these days, and found three cars that I liked at Kia.  I went in on Saturday to speak with Jennifer, and she told me that there was a car coming into the showroom in a few days, which was the exact car that I wanted.  I was nervous that the car would be late, as I needed to return the loaner within a few days.  Jennifer assured me that the car would be on time, so I paid my deposit and hoped for the best.  The car was delivered two days earlier than expected 12/8/21, and I was thrilled!  Now, the long process of paperwork that we all dread right?  No!  I was pleasantly surprised when I went in and spoke with Sean Philip to go over the paperwork, that it was a fast, and thorough process. I was in and out in about 30 minutes. I then spent about an hour with Jennifer to go over all the details of my new car, and was re-introduced to the service staff.  To say I was beyond happy that Classic Kia made this trying time in my life better, is an understatement!

The total came to approx. £240.00. I provided a screenshot of the purchases showing all the detail that was provided on my bill. I was told that a refund or investigation could not be processed without a ""Correlation ID"". Such ID does not exist - O2 do not produce them and after speaking to O2 on at least 4 separate occasions, every single person confirmed that no such Correlation ID exists. I repeated this to Google Play each time and was told there was nothing they could do without this ID. I called 02 again today to see if they could help me; they repeatedly tried to get through to Google Play via phone but could not get through. I was on hold for over half an hour. Eventually they had to give up as it was impossible to get through to someone. It is not right or fair that I am not being given a refund because of an ID number that Google Play are asking for which doesn't exist.  It is IMPOSSIBLE to find a contact number for Google Play UK customer service, and IMPOSSIBLE to get any use out of their help centre if you don't have a google play account.

If you need to know who he is or want to avoid him, he will be the tall one who looks homeless. I had mentioned to the staff I wanted to have a dialog with him about a situation that manifested itself. He had been dodging me so he wouldn't have to deal with it. I brought up The fact, that he was having a rough time with retention in the store when it came to his D&D night. When he denied this he blamed it on Covid. I had just started going back there during covid and had chatted with players. (So what I had witnessed had nothing to do with covid, another one of his lies) They had told me they were unhappy with who they were sat (sat meaning who was going to be their DM) with and they were most likely not going to show up again. Indeed after a few weeks, the store thinned out from having about 8 or 9 tables to barely being able to have three and none of the tables were full. When I had cornered him with the information he brought up a lie about being banned. I have yet to be banned from anywhere. To destroy that story short I crushed it with actual facts and he left that alone. So the store had/s rules you could go around if you looked at it logically so you could go to the table you wanted to. When I explained what I had done, he had no answer. I had asked why if I am following your rules I can't do that. I had done it before and no one had an issue with it. He then just referred it to the D&D organizer who always says talk to Jeremy (""He the ones who makes the rules"") about it and when you ask Jeremy he says talk to Andrew. I got the feeling that I was dealing with a MAN-BABY who when you catch in a lie or tough situation, he will lie some more or scapegoat it onto someone else. When I have chatted with the other workers of the store that agreed with me fully, If you're not having a good time at a table and you are paying for the experience then you should definitely sit at a table you enjoy and have a good time at. Jeremey bluntly said we won't let you pick your DM. I only went to this store because of the proximity to my house, Jeremy is a foul-tempered ass or dick depending on his mood.  What I have seen since then I first went there they tend to have horrible D&D store organizers, that have ego issues. If they are picked by Jeremy I would understand the mimic him so well.",US

They have been running raffle competitions for about two years now I believe they started off putting designer handbags up as prizes and that went really well for them and word soon spread so Odurn branched out into bigger and better prizes or more varied prizes might be a more apt statement to make.  In March of 2021 I entered a cash raffle for £3500 for the sum of £20 for 20 tickets and I won it. I could not believe my luck honestly I was bowled over my heart was beating out of my chest the adrenalin was pumping through my viens so fast I could feel the heat in my skin building up it was unreal. How people cope with winning millions I just don't know I think it would finish me off! The money was in my account in three or four days I just had to provide ID etc plus it was a weekend. Two weeks later I won another £2500 what the hell just happened I couldn't get my head around it. But it proves that it's a legitimate company and you can win more than once so I personally found that great but also hoped it gave others a bit of hope too as it can happen.  Needless to say during the course of the year I was even more fortunate enough to have further wins some really nice ones too but the icing on the cake has to be I just won on Fri Dec 10/21  a SUBARU WRX STI + £1000 it's an absolute stunning car 300 BHP, mapped, tuned, body kitted, straight twin piped and its full main dealer service history it's mint condition. A collectable asset to be looked after, that will increase in price especially as we transition into electric vehicles these cars will be sought after. So I feel double lucky.and I have ODURN to thank. One of the founders of Odurn presented me with the car and I think that was a lovely touch, a really nice gesture to maintain that link with the customer himself, I appreciated that. The staff there are really great too, if you do have a win they are there straight away to guide you through the process as it is a bit daunting  when you realise you're live on Facebook you don't know how many people are listening. However , they are really great to chat to and email you back if you have any questions. All in all, a really great company,I can't fault them. I highly rate them and will continue to support them . I hope if you do give them a go you have just as much fun as I have and wins along the way too.",GB

The father and son provided us with a quote and the confidence they had with the restoration project enthused us to go ahead with the work. WRONG decision as the father and son weren’t going to be doing the work.  Instead we had a team of three, often only two, who were not as skilled as the father and son.  What should have been a relatively easy job turned into a nightmare for us, the customers.  I made the mistake of making the team feel comfortable enough that they treated the home as their own.  Eating lunch with feet up on my good dining chairs, eventually stripping the colour out of the timber due to something on the bottom of the shoes. The project started in the laundry and that went really well.  The next room was the main bathroom and again went really well.  The kitchen was the next room and that is when it all went wrong and got worse and worse as the work went on.  The product being used for the timber kitchen bench top was one that the team said they had never used.  So I thought that maybe they should not be doing the work.  At the completion of the kitchen we had asked the father and son to come and tell us if the work was to an acceptable standard.  They were shocked and then they spent another three weeks repairing the damage done by the team that did the work, their employees Moving onto the ensuite!  The team of employees scratched a tile and didn’t say a word, didn’t even fix it.  I noticed that the vanity top had a few chips in it and it was caused by tools being placed straight onto it and not a rag in sight.  Not a word said.  It wasn’t until I noticed the scratch that the son came and removed the tile that was scratched and he then did even more damage and didn’t say a word.  It wasn’t until I noticed that the another tile had been damaged that they then came to remove and replace the damaged vanity top and the newly damaged tile.  I thought to myself great, it is now completed.  WRONG!  The son had cut straight through the wrapped vanity and didn’t say anything, not a single word.

I attempted to give a review for a State Farm agent I had who was involved in insurance fraud and Google allowed him to remove my review. I attempted to review a marriage counselor who was terrible and Google allowed him to remove the review. Google reviews are not legitimate if negative reviews can be removed. Neither of these businesses I mentioned have any negative reviews! I do a lot of reviews on Google reviews and I think I am going to just remove them all.

It failed in mid December after the update. Google have acknowledged the issue on their official tracker webpage and told me (and hundreds of other people whose phones now no longer receive or make calls or texts) to keep checking the issue tracker web page. They have also had bug reports uploaded from my new Pixel 6 phone. Since then they have not updated the tracker page nor me nor other customers. They have no ETA on when the phones will be fixed but say that software issues are not covered by warranty even though they've caused them. I've asked for a refund because my brand new (supposed flagship) Google Pixel 6 no longer works as a phone. No response to that either. This is an issue that's affected hundreds probably thousands of people across Europe and Google have only giving it a mid severity level S3 for their attention of their engineers even though the phones are unusable.. it's been such a disappointing experience both of the phone( and it's dodgy modem firmware) and of Google's total lack of managing customer expectations and very poor customer service.

For example, to optimize for a restaurant environment, it is necessary to be in the environment and remove the devices from your ears, install in the base, reprogram, reinsert the devices in your ears, test and repete as needed. This process must be repeated  for other environment settings, such as Meetings, TV, Crowd, Theatre, Phone, etc.. Given the number of potential settings, I find this process is filled with confusion and uncertainty.  Further, lights that inform the user that each device is being charged, function sporadically, which leaves me uncertain if the devices are operating as designed. Eargo offers no incentive to upgrade or trade in. If I were to buy a the newest version that might solves my problems, I would be doubling my investment in less than two years. That's almost $6,000.  User's recommendation: Don’t buy without an upgrade guarantee.",US

On December 10th we took our 11 year old Chihuahua into the emergency care at VCA Aurora because she was drinking excessive water and was unable to keep it down and also had not eaten over 24 hours. She is also on seizure medication. We arrived at about 9 pm, we were happy to see they were not busy.We explained why we were their and they immediately took her back to an exam room for evaluation. Nearly an hour passed and they came out and got us from the waiting room and brought us back to an exam room, where we waited until Dr. Michael Houfek came in to tell what needs to be done . He said the concern was that she was dehydrated and one of her pupils was enlarged leading him to believe she may have a brain tumor or cancer or she may have had a stroke. He then presented us a treatment plan saying she would need blood work, her kidneys and liver checked as well as an ultrasound and MRI that would would have to wait until Monday, 3 days later, she would also need to be hospitalized for 48 hours. the total estimate was well over $6000.00 which they would need half to start the treatment. Michael Houfek also said the other option was to euthanize her because in his words"" she will not be the same dog as yesterday ""( we brought in a lively dog who was dehydrated, and all of a sudden she is deteriorating this quick, I don't buy that ). We asked that since she is dehydrated that they start her on fluids, Michael Houfek was very negative and said that she is declining and that would not change the outcome. At this point no tests were run , the only thing done was a catheter was put into her leg. He then told us her glucose level was 80 and said her kidneys and liver may be failing. We then asked if we can do the basics, blood work and urinalysis  so that we may have a better understanding of what is going on with her so that we can make a determination of what our next steps may be. We then asked she be put on fluids at which time Michael Houfek said they will work up a new estimate, we again asked to have fluids started and he left the room obviously annoyed. Another 45 minutes has passed, during this whole time we have not seen our dog, as she was somewhere in another room. Now Michael Houfek sent in a young tech to go over the new estimate nearly $3000 ( although very high priced I am not complaining about the cost , I was just trying to get some answers with the least amount spent so we can make a decision on our next steps.) We asked again if fluids have been started because before Michael Houfek left the room earlier we agreed that he was going to place fluids under her skin to help with the dehydration. Now 1 more hour has passed and he sent in an older woman holding our chihuahua away from her body and said that the doctor wanted you  to see the condition she was in, to us she looked very scared all we kept hearing from them is she will not improve but at the same time they keep pushing the treatment plan, this tells me they care nothing about our pet and they only care about how much money they can get us to agree to. Before the tech left with our dog again , we had asked again why the fluids have not been started before she was able to leave we stopped her and said we would like to see her receive the fluids and to get Michael Houfek into the room to do it. ( after over 3 hours emotions were starting to take over ) At this point we were there over 3 1/2 hours and still nothing has been done except a catheter was put into her front leg. We had already agreed to the blood work and fluids so we can take her home. Michael Houfek was very negative the whole time and my emotions got the better part of me , at this point Michael Houfek ordered us out of the building. As I was walking to my car I noticed the catheter was still in my baby. I went back in to have it removed. I brought my dear lively Chihuahua to the emergency room because she can not keep water down and that she had not eaten over a day and we left about 4 hours later with a pet that looked 10 times worse then she got there.  We then decided to go straight to Plainfield Animal Hospital, while in route our beloved Mercedes had passed away. ( we certainly hope they did not do anything to harm our baby. The last statement Michael Houfek said to us was to get out of the building I have other patients who have approved treatment. ( maybe a HIPPA violation). The only reason we came here was it was much closer than Plainfield. Boy oh boy did we learn a lesson. I DO NOT RECOMMEND anyone to come here due to the unprofessionalism displayed by Michael Houfek. We honestly believe that the inaction of Michael Houfek by not giving fluids killed our dog. DO NOT BRING YOUR BELOVED PET HERE.",US

Each time it was started with no problems, and I drove the vehicle for weeks with no problem. I decided to rejoin AAA. With the same little seldom usage. I needed the car towed to a repair shop. When the Service arrived I told the tow truck driver I wanted the vehicle ""towed"" to a repair shop. The driver began hooking up charge cables to the vehicle. I told him I DO NOT want the vehicle ""jumped"" I want it towed! He told me he needed to ""Jump start"" the vehicle to get it into gear.  The Car lights started flashing, the horn was blaring, and I smelled a burnt smell. The engine was fired! It cost several thousands of dollars to repair, I reported this to AAA Claims and a Supervisor called and told me a Manager? said that because the car was ""Jump started"" prior to their service. They would NOT cover the repair! I argued that it didn't matter if the car was ""jump started"" a hundred times and started and was driven with no problems. This ""jump"" was the problem because it wouldn't start, and major repairs had to be done! The fault was this last ""jump""!  AAA IS NOT ON YOUR SIDE!

From the very start I could tell that Mr. Tung understood the importance of maintaining the strong tradition and favorable reputation that Honda has established over the years. He recognized that you cannot separate the car from the customer and that selling the car is more than a sale. He realized the big picture is ensuring that customers will want to continue to do business with Honda. I could tell he saw me as a person and not a sale because he was very personable and agreeable and was interested in getting to know me beyond making the sale. Friendliness is extremely important to me when making a business decision and he was very friendly. I would also like to mention the names of David Bradley who spent over an hour on the phone making sure I got approved. And Gregory Goodfriend who stayed well after hours to make sure all my consumer needs were met. It is dealerships such as these that have deservedly given Honda the great name it continues to enjoy.",US

Store was to open at 11:00 a.m.; waited to 11:30 a.m. - no one to open the store.  Left and came back around 1:30 p.m. when the Viking started to stink.  I cannot say enough good things about Alec who was not the employee that was supposed to open the store, but the employee that walked into a busy situation that could have turned bad if it weren't for Alec's cool head, work process and work ethic.  Alec spoke to each customer who came in the store and problem solved with them briefly explaining he would get to them as soon as possible.  While he did this he worked with me and another senior to get our new phones up and running.  Talk about patience....many of the customers who came in didn't know how to use their phones nor their personal information and he patiently explained each and every question and concern while he used websites and other online tools to problem solve what we didn't know.  As normal, some of the actions in getting new phones updated from an outdated phone happened and would cause Alec to start processes over.  He did this with humor and without loosing his temper or forming a bad attitude. While it took a good deal of time with him being the only employee in the store, I believe all of us left satisfied.  This employee deserves your highest recognition, and to the employee that didn't show up....well some people are responsible and others just aren't.  A coworker was really left in a jam, but this go getter worked his way right out of the problem.  Alec retained several AT&T customers that day by providing outstanding customer service.  This would be a five star rating except for the amount of time the process took and that appeared to be a case of poor scheduling and nothing that Alec could have helped.

If there is anywhere else you would like me to put it just let me know.  Thanks you all immensely for everything you are doing for Janice an for myself. You all are such a comfort during this difficult time I don’t know what I would do without you.   Hello All: If you are looking for a caring place for your family member look no farther. My sister has been her 8 times for rehabilitation. She ends  up in the hospital for some reason or other and then to Stonemere they turn her around in 2 short weeks and she goes back to her assisted living facility.  Their rehab is above none in the area. Matthew – Executive Director- Melissa - Director of Nursing - Tiffany Her assistant.  Mary Lou - liaison between hospital who has helped me move her over there in a day. You couldn't find nicer more compassionate people.  They really care about your loved one and you. They are on top of everything and oversee your loved ones care. There isn’t any other place that I would ever want my loved one in.  This time Janice couldn't go home she has aspiration pneumonia assisted living couldn't handle it.  They refused her at the hospital I was in a panic contacted Mary Lou who called me from the middle of the ocean on her vacation and said not to worry we have a place for her. I was in a panic of where she could go.  We moved her there in 4 hours and she is checked on regularly. Kirk - Food and Beverage Director gives her the pureed food and thickened liquids she needs now. She is doing much better. They are all Angels and a gift from GOD. They work with you and make your feel at peace and even help you with your very difficult decisions. I can't say enough. So if need a new home for your aging parent or family member. Make Stonemere your first stop you won’t go any further. I truly hope this helps someone! JillK,US

I signed up for a 'Breakthrough Session' which is when the business owner does his high-pressure sales pitch (think pre-covid door knocking sales style) mixed with emotive coercion (close your eyes and imagine how it will feel in 6 months’ time when you have dropped X kgs..”). By the way, you subsidise his sales pitch, as you don’t actually get the $47 “deposit” back. One of the first questions he asks is whether you will be able to make a financial commitment today and, if not, he will want to reschedule the appointment. The idea is to use the hard sales technique to get an immediate commitment ($97-$109 per week for 6 months = $2,522-$2,834) so you don’t have time to give due consideration to the large financial commitment. I asked to discuss the finances with my husband before signing the contract and he tried to convince me it was definitely a “family expense” so my husband should be fine with it and to just sign the contract. I pushed hard to speak to my husband but, in hindsight, I should have slept on it before signing up. Too bad if you regret your decision, or fall into financial hardship during the 6 months, because there’s no getting out of the contract! Oh, unless you lose your job and can prove this by providing a letter of severance from the employer he tells me. Hopefully there are no more hoops to jump after that but I’m unable to verify. The day after signing up I asked if I could be on a 3-month program and was told 6 months was the minimum. Then 1 month into the program, when I couldn’t afford the weekly direct debits and asked to terminate the contract, I was advised that my financial issues were due to buying too many takeaways and to “finish what I came here to start” and to push through the ""hard times"". He claimed my coach had told him of my alleged expensive takeaway habits. I have no doubt in my mind this conversation never occurred. The one takeaway in 4 weeks was not the cause of my financial issues (I mean, really!?). All correspondence with the business owner after seeking to terminate the contract has been patronising, dishonest and severely unprofessional. I would not recommend this program. I will say however that my coach has been fantastic in all manner of ways including her knowledge, accountability, and professionalism. But if you are looking for value for money, freedom to make a considered decision, courteous and professional communication from the business owner who is very involved in the day to day of the program, this is not for you! These are my key takeaways from the program ... 😉",AU

We live in Henderson and only use our motorhome occasionally and the items needing repair did not prevent us from using our motorhome. Since Camping World couldn’t get us in for nearly 2 months I decided to try a mobile repair company. They came out within a couple of days and we discussed what all needed to be repaired (this was last August). They got the necessary info from my extended warranty and said they would get back to me. Weeks pasted….They informed me that they were having a hard time getting the part numbers and prices for the items required. I’m retired so I got on the web and made calls to Jayco manufacturing and local dealers, after many calls over a few days I found out what the part numbers were and the prices of the parts. I also found out that they could be ordered and were in stock (a macerator, windshield washer fluid reservoir and pump motor and a cargo door latch). When I relayed all this information to Blair at TNT he said it didn’t really matter because the distributor that they use can’t get the parts and that he would only get parts through his distributor. He told me that if I didn’t want to wait that I could order them myself and then submit a claim to my warranty company. That is not how it should work so needless to say that was the end of that. I have since made an appointment at Camping World (which I have used in the past with my warranty). After discussing the work and parts needed they assured me that like in the past I will not be paying for parts and submitting claims for reimbursement. In short, I can’t comment on the work quality of TNT since we didn’t get that far but I can say that after 3 months their parts distributor couldn’t get the parts needed (even though they were in stock at other facilities). So if you’re using an extended warranty for a repair that may need uncommon parts I would stick with an established dealer that won’t be asking you to buy your own parts and then submit your own paperwork to the warranty company for reimbursements.",US

My daughter bought a 2017 Ford Escape in 9/2020 with roughly 34,000 miles and in Great condition. It ran great for the first 6 months. In 5/2021 her check engine light came on and it wouldn't accelerate, it would chug and then die. She took it into a mechanic on 6/12/21 in the town she lives in to have it looked at (she doesn't live in the same city as where she purchased the vehicle). They replaced the Injector & Fuel Pressure Sensor, Injection Pump. This repair was over a $1000 out of pocket.  The vehicle was NOT driven off of the mechanics lot until after 7/26/2021. She drove it for the next couple of weeks with it running just fine around town. Mid August she drove it back to the town that she bought the car from and the next day after arriving, the check engine light came back on and wouldn't accelerate at all. We took it to our mechanic where they looked at it and said that it needs to go to the Phil Long Ford Dealership due to the parts are still covered under warranty .  We had to tow it to the dealership because at this point it wouldn't accelerate at all, and would die.  8/18/21 they had to order parts to fix the car which took over a week to get the parts and then scheduled to be installed. They went in and replaced the Pump ASY, Fuel Tank, Tappet ASY, & Tubing ASY.  She did not get the car back until the first part of Sept 2021. Once again when she got the car back it was running GREAT, on 9/15/21 the check engine light came on AGAIN, along with it not accelerating (Same issues as the previous two times) we took it back to Phil Long Ford. By now she's getting a little nervous about driving the car due to it's unreliability with the check engine light coming on and the lack of acceleration. It's NOW becoming a Safety issue. She gets the car back and drives it back to where she lives again running Great.  On 10/1/21 GUESS WHAT?!?! Yes, the check engine light comes on and immediately quits accelerating. The Ford dealership in the town she lives in couldn't get her in until the first week of Nov 21, where Phil Long Ford dealership where she has taken it to the previous 2 times could get her in on 10/22. My husband and I had to drive 7 hours rent a trailer and haul the car back another 7 hour to the town that she purchased the vehicle in.  On 10/18/21 we called Ford Motor Company with a complaint stating that she doesn't want this car anymore due to it's Unreliability & Safety not to mention constantly being in the shop. 10/22/2021 were able to get the car back to the Phil Long Ford dealership and 10/27/2021 they called her to let her know they were going to have to replace the High Pressure Fuel Pump, Exhaust Cam Shaft, Valve Cover Gasket, Oil Pump, and the Cam Shaft"". They said that they had to order parts that would take up to 2 weeks to get in and then they would have to schedule her in. 11/4/2021 she was told by Ford Motor Co that she didn't qualify for the Buy Back program (We were shocked - Really)!!! What does qualify.  She's not asking for a brand new car be given to her, all she wants is a similar vehicle that is Safe and Reliable. Here it is 11/12/2021, the car is under  50,000 miles and for the last 6 months it's been in for repair for the same reason 4 times.  I can't fully express my disappointment and concerns within the Ford Family. I have always thought of you to be a GREAT American made company with values that treat your customers with respect and by doing the right thing. I can see this is clearly not the case. I know that your expert mechanics are trying to resolve the numerous issues, which is Great.  But she needs to have a Safe and Reliable car.  You then can sell this car to someone else. She has been paying on a vehicle for over 6 months now and it has been in the shop multiple times all for the same reason.  Shame on you Ford!",US

The result far exceeded my expectations. First, at quotation, Chris provided detailed descriptions about what was and was not included in the paint job, as well as optional add-ons. He clearly was trustworthy and I appreciated his approach. Second, we agreed to a custom mix: Chris's team removed and replaced roof moldings;  I also asked him to add a buff to the clear coat. He agreed to use ""painters putty"" to handle nick's on the hood and chips in the door. I chose to remove and replace the emblems myself, and to take care of some dents. His attitude was simply ""we're here to serve you -whatever you like!"" Third, the day before I was to pick it up, I called to check on time.  Chris aplogetically told me that he wasn't satisfied with the finish on one area and wanted to redo it. He could have just ""shipped it"", but clearly was working to a higher standard.  We agreed to extend the time for proper curing of the clear coat before the buffing. Fourth, I was floored when I picked it up! The interior, which I'd cleaned before dropping it off, was absolutely pristine.  The finish was just beautiful, superb job in masking!  Even the tires had been treated with that shiny finish. None of this was mentioned up front, I simply needed a paint job. Chris said ""I told my guys I wanted it to look like new. They succeeded! Fifth, this evening I took it to ""Friday night at the Airfield"".  Four of us have painted multiple cars ourselves. Two had painted planes and one a winning show car.  Everyone was suprised by how nice the job came out  at such reasonable price.  Bottom line, using good materials is important, but personal care, attention to detail  and craftsmanship are what matters in the painting business. I highly recommend Maaco of New Bedford!",US

The building came under new management on October 1st, and a Levi Prody, Assistant Office Manager, at Tullio keeps telling me that they're working on getting me my refund back but I have yet to receive it.  He promised me on October 12 that it would be ""overnighted to me asap"".  In fact the property management company, Pennrise Management, based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, promised the same thing on October 22, but will not even answer my emails or phone calls any longer and they owe me $710.00 as a refund.  This amount was stated to me two times by Levi at Tullio, as well as Donna Hale at Pennrose.  I have spoke to Donna Hale and Lakita and Larea Maldonado at Pennrose, at least four times already, and they are not even answering my email inquiries or phone calls now to avoid me.

My husband had the salad which looked like they pulled all the wilted lettuces and used them.  We ordered chicken parm and chicken marsala. Parm came with Spaghetti with tomato sauce, which my husband almost chocked on. Marsala came with Spaghetti with some type of cheese and butter sauce that was totally disgusting.  The marsala sauce was brown gravy with some mushrooms thrown in it.  Not marsala by any means.  Sadly to say the best part of this meal was the bread and the ice cream.

Taking my 2008 Subaru there for 100,000, then 120,000 services, I trusted that the services would comply with the service manual schedule supplied with the car. The second service requires a cambelt replacement and this is included in the original quote from Subaru Doncaster. When I collected the car the cambelt and ancillary rollers/tensioners were added to the invoice. I became concerned when I compared the  invoiced items and compared those listed in the maintenance schedule. There was wide discrepancy in the two lists, increasing my concern. I wrote to the Management and put my issue to them, asking for a written reply. There was none. After some weeks and a second letter, the Management called me and suggested that I might 'drop in for coffee' and we could discuss the matter. The pandemic intervened and I am now about to re-enter discussions, hopefully. For advice from a third party, I sent copies of my issues and correspondence to Consumer Affairs.

Just went to take Titan to the vet and due to roadworks and traffic, it took me 30mins to get there instead of 5.  I made the appointment days ago because they were fully booked but when  I called them to let them know I would be 10 minutes late, they refused to see him ( I can't tell you how many times I've patiently waited beyond my appointment time there) and they could not reschedule another appointment quickly and showed no regard for his health. This is also after they called me earlier today and confirmed the wrong time and reason for my appointment and I had to correct them.  I have been taking my dogs to Roxburgh Park animal hospital and Craigieburn animal hospital for over 10 years.  Their service has been gradually declining. They seem to have a lot of attrition with staff and you never know the quality of vet you will see.  Some have been very good but have moved on quickly and others have been too lazy to check my dogs properly or are scared of my dogs.  It's impossible to build a good rapport or for a vet to get to know your animal as you rarely see the same vet.  When Daisy had a cancer removed from her leg, it wasn't stitched well and came open within days.  They initially told me I had to wait a week to get her gaping wound fixed.  In the end, after my complaints they did put her in quicker.  It's hard to get an appointment and little care is given to the urgency of some situations.  They are not a vet you can rely on when it counts.  I kept asking them to check Daisy out as she wasn't herself.  They treated me like I was over reacting and said she didn't need a blood test.  In time it became apparent she was really ill and less than a year later she was dead.  Would not recommend them if you care about your animals and will not be taking mine there again.",AU

Kate was just so knowledgable about everything Wedding in Cyprus… she has all the answers to all the questions, stuff we were stressing over with previous planner the experience was just so different.  Then sadly our 2nd date in May 2021 again was cancelled due to Covid restrictions & UK travel ban.  So Kate rearranged our 3rd date  for August 2021 that turned into our third time lucky 🍀  Kate guided us all through the whole process everything we needed for our perfect Cyprus dream wedding,  and more importantly helping with all the legal stuff both here  in the Uk and in Cyprus. Her communication  was just excellent!! she would break things down into easy steps to follow, set tasks for us to do as the wedding approached  in order of when it was required, broke everything into manageable tasks. Called us if she needed information and equally we could call her too. That was so reassuring and important. obviously so much goes into organising your day Kate has it covered. She sent emails with great links very easy to follow to get everything done. Choosing all the finer things was just so simple, so much choice for everything you may require. Kate has it all covered. The way marry me Cyprus sent everything across to us  made a stressful situation so much easier. Getting married in the middle of a pandemic wasn’t always easy  but Kate and her team were just brilliant!! Put our minds at rest. We had some big  difficulties quiet near to flying out to our wedding  Kate  very quickly resolved everything and took all the worries away.  Her knowledge of the Cyprus wedding industry is second to none. I as the mother of the bride found making the final payment for the wedding really simple, I had visions of having to sort it all out there.  But was all organised before we arrived which I found brilliant as you could just arrive and enjoy the beautiful occasion.

The surgery turned out badly. Dr. Jennifer A. Spiegel, who performed the surgery said: “it happens” and walked out. Everything in my left eye appears much smaller in size and badly distorted. There are no straight lines in that eye. Every door, picture frame, power pole, anything that is straight, is now bent in several places. I constantly see double flashes of light, sometimes every minute or so. They look like fireflies or meteorites. I have lost my depth perception. Pictures of my retina show my macula is pulled flat on one side, instead of being cup shaped. I have not been able to find any reviews of my surgeon anywhere in the 3 states and the 5 cities where she has practiced in the last 12 years. The only procedure mentioned is LASIK. I cannot find any reference of her ever being a retina specialist before coming to the Central Coast. I now go to a true retina specialist, Dr. Nathan Steinle, who has top grades in his training and impeccable reviews. This highly qualified specialist told me I have a stretched retina. It is pulling on my macula, causing the distortion. The constant flashes are caused by the stretched retina. I cannot read or write without keeping one eye closed, otherwise, I see double characters My left eye is limited in function, and cannot be repaired. I often wake up at night, thinking about my eyesight, and how I could have had a different outcome. My primary eye caregiver at Pacific Eye Surgeons, whom I trusted, may have used poor judgement by sending me to Dr. Spiegel, with the admonishment: “I was going to lose the vision in my eye” if I didn’t rush over to her office. He used to send all of his retina patients to Dr. Steinle. Please choose wisely Peter Prince",US

But first I wanted to sit in one, couldn’t use the one we saw because it was in the process of being driven away by its new owner.  It was raining now but Marlon said he’d pull one up that we could check out and drive if needed.  We did that, it suited us, so we started the process of evaluating our trade in and working out a deal.  Marlon got that process started, we settled in for the back an forth of negotiating the price.

The room was big, had great storage and anything we needed, Shannon was sure to help us out. We like it so much, we went back for a weekend and stayed in the Captain's room. This has 2 bedrooms and a pull out couch. The rooms were clean and comfortable. This also has a second story deck that has a great view of the ocean and an excellent view of the sunset. They also have a bar in the basement with Doug as your bartender. Great bar!

Hello  Sorry but I don't make complaints very often,  but feel on this occasion for the need to.  My wife and myself sat outside yesterday afternoon around 2 pm ish and I went into the bar and a very Rude short man with dark hair and a moustache aged around mid to late 30s served me,  I politely asked him for the drinks and everything was too much trouble for him,  perhaps he was having a bad day.   I never said anything about him to my wife, but when we left my wife went inside to use the toilet before we left,  she asked the same angry man,  where the toilets were,  He Angrilly replied to her - ""We haven't got any "" she was very offended by his insults, then he laughed and said- ""I am only Joking "".   My wife mentioned this to me as we drove back home to Carmarthen, as such I felt the need to complain,  it's a really nice place you have there,  it's a shame that you have a Horrible member of staff like that working there.  I am not expecting you to anything about this,  but I am a Google Reviwer and will leave appropriate feedback on different platforms myself over this.

Then spent well over an hour with Google support to try and get it working to no avail. Then the real fun began.  Google’s return policy is that you have to post the item back to them, and in the meantime they will send you a new device. If they don’t receive the device within 21 days they will charge your account for the replacement item. Not ideal but okay.  So they sent me details on how to arrange the courier to pick up my broken device, of course I had to arrange it all myself, they just gave me an account number to reference so I didn’t get charged. Next thing to know that to do the return they wanted me to send the item internationally to Hong Kong on their behalf, I live in Australia - so I had to print out and fill out an internal returns/RMA form for them, (in triplicate) an international customs declaration form for them, (in triplicate) a commercial invoice form for their internal charging processes, and a security form with my verified ID stating that I wasn’t exporting drugs or anything dangerous under the penalty of law.  Absolutely atrocious processes, google basically making me do all their legwork for them because they don’t want to pay local staff to do the international shipping.  So I printed off and filled out all the 8 forms, I found a box and wrapped it all up safely and rang the courier to arrange a pickup. They gave me a 4 hour period to wait for the pickup driver to arrive. I waited 4 hours and no one arrived. No contact nothing, they just didn’t turn up.  So I rang again and made another appointment, and waited 4 hours and again they didn’t turn up.  And again.  And again.  Then I got an email telling me because I hadn’t returned their item they were going to charge me an additional $325 for the replacement. I tried to call them, they advertise a call centre number and hours of operation but that is a total lie, the number is disconnected 24x7 - their only support is chat it seems. So I got them on chat and spent more hours arguing with the useless support person.  They didn’t care that the pickup hadn’t arrived at all, they just told me that was the only process. Their only suggestion was that I drive a 160kms round trip to my nearest ‘fedex’ store and hand the device over in person. I told them that wasn’t ever going to happen, may I please speak to a supervisor. Supervisor came on, wasted my time for the next hour and told me exactly what the last idiot told me - stiff, that’s the process, we can’t/won’t help you. She even threatened to ban me because I complained that they were telling me to just ‘suck it up’ & she said that phrase was somehow ‘offensive’.  Eventually I got an email from the courier head office, and got to complain to their head office (not thanks to google btw) and they finally on the fifth try they sent someone over within a few hours. A few weeks later I finally got notification that the faulty device had been received and was spared getting charged.  All in all it was the most stressful, most unhelpful service I have ever received from any company. Sure a lot of it was the courier not google, but the sheer uselessness and arrogance of the support I had dealing from google, that they just didn’t care at all that their own process wasn’t working has made me never ever want to buy anything from them direct again.  The replacement product is okay, no real complaints there, but never have I had such a bad experience dealing with customer service from any company.",AU

But this company didnt need to replace the whole exhaust system, but just repaired the broken tailpipe.  Well due to their expertise I went from a 2000.00 estimate to a final bill of 230.00.   It was an hour trip each way, scenic and without any traffic at all.  I pulled in at 11am and was on my way home at before noon.  And they were nice as can be and treated me like a family friend.

We purchased the vehicle late December 2019/early January 2020 from Mercedes Benz of Maitland.  It was the first time owning a MB and purchased due to the reviews of the vehicle and company.  Prior to owning a MB we were Infiniti owners and wanted to “upgrade” to a better vehicle.  During the purchase the sales department convinced us to purchase amongst many warranties available the Tire/Rim warranty.  Well here is where the problems start.  They neglected to tell us that the warranty we purchased was not valid on the vehicle we had purchased because they SOLD it to us with AFTERMARKET rims.  Why sell us the warranty package? At this point to ROB us of money they saw readily available to the dealership.  Completely bad business on there part.  The first time we needed to use the warranty purchased we went to MB Millenia and they advised of the “useless” warranty package purchased and they could not honor it due to the fact that the car was sold with rims that were not covered under this warranty.  At that point Maitland had the vehicle towed to their location.  They kept the car for 3 weeks during the repair (now i realize they knew they could NOT repair the rim).  When we rec’d the vehicle back, the repair was not up to par and the rim was still bent.  When we took the car back to them they took another 2 weeks to repair the same rim (and they let us drive off in an unsafe vehicle).  Down the road a month later we found ourselves with a flat again.  When we took the vehicle  to the closest shop (Maitland was too far) they advised us that the rim on the vehicle was cracked.  We took the car back to MB of Maitland at which point I spoke with Frank Carasquillo the Director of Sales since the GM was ""not available"".  He assured me that he would call me back within the following 24 hours, upon receiving his voice mail at the 26th hour mark, I placed a call to the Corporate office and filed a complaint.  Five minutes later I rec’d a call from Frank advising he was awaiting FINAL APPROVAL(which was BOGUS) to have everything replaced.  We took the vehicle in on Friday 09-03-21 and after a huge run around I was connected to Ed Taylor, Director of Service whom Frank passed the baton too.  He advised that they put the rims/tires on order and would call us when they arrived.  The rims arrived on 09-16-21 and the appointment was scheduled for today 09-17-21.  We took the vehicle to service and were advised today that they will not cover the cost, we are stuck with bad rims, a car with a warranty that is invalid and feeling defeated.  This is something I would expect from a low end vehicle definitely not a Mercedes Benz dealership.  After a call to corporate the resolution given was to return the money paid on the warranty and they had the nerve to try and get me to trade the vehicle as if i would purchase another car from them ever again (mind you i just purchased a brand new 2021 C300 with $29,000 down-money is not an issue but integrity is everything) What i really wanted to do is tell them to take their Piece of Crap MB and give me all my money back so i can go to a REPUTABLE MB DEALERSHIP and purchase a new MB in CASH once again.

So anyone with a google account can add a review to your business profile whether they've had dealings with your business or not.  If in the case it's fictitious or malicious, after contacting google customer services, they reply with a standard email saying reviews cannot be removed as it is important to 'customers', yet someone who isn't, nor have they ever been a customer can add comments.  Making google business reviews a total waste of time as you can't trust the content, which goes against the grain of googles business values.",GB

I ask why don't you just raise the prices rather than hide in fees.  Young lady apologized but I cancelled the order.  I feel it's deceptive to advertise a price for a menu item then charge a fee to order it.

He listened and patiently addressed our questions and concerns.  His professionalism and candor played a big part in our decision to buy from Koons.  Shawn in the finance department also contributed to our vehicle purchase positively by expertly navigating us through the financials and familiarization with the warranty and service contract we bought.  Shawn even went the extra mile to assure us that the 2019 Toyota Tundra we were purchasing was covered and eligible for the warranty Koons was selling us even though it had a small lift kit on it.  This extra attention to detail gave us piece of mind and “sealed the deal” when it came to the truck purchase.  Other Koons members like Mike also worked to give us a positive buying experience.

We have been dealt with on 6/7 occasions now by Pat and Arthur, and those lads know their craft so, so well.  They are inspiring to be fair. Their telephone manner and face to face is just perfect, and everything they said they would deliver via email or telephone they honoured. The team really take the time to talk to you and we have taken 3 bikes in for repair since and are purchasing a new one from them.  I really can't offer enough praise towards them as they fixed my classic 25 year old bike and it runs like a dream.  The atmosphere is always calm and open in the workshop and the repairs that they have completed were in record time on each bike. The experience has been truly special because our bikes have sentimental attachments involving our parents.  If you have made it this far, thanks for hearing me out and if you are in any doubt about where to get any bike related repairs / service / knowledge / and products  etc. GO SEE THESE GUYS.

I liked that it’s located in the perimeter area. However, though this is a non smoking hotel, the first room I was assigned smelled of smoke. I was moved to a second room with an air conditioner that hissed and clicked; additionally, the tv didn’t work.  By the time I settled in and noticed the air conditioner issue, I was dressed for bed and exhausted so didn’t call the front desk cause I could not fathom a move to yet another room or a maintenance person repairing at such a late hour.  During my second stay, the room had a dripping tub faucet and the tub was clogged and partially filled with water so I was uncomfortable standing in that water to take a shower. The tub was also damaged and the tiling old and dirty. It was late and I was tired. I did not want to pack up my things to move so I went to bed.  Just after getting into bed, I got a call from the front desk after 10pm demanding that I return downstairs to fill out a pet form. My pets were with me at checkin so not sure why I was not asked then to fill out the form. After returning to my room, there were children running up and down the hall way around 11pm. I asked that they stop but the running and loud laughing continued. I called front desk snd security stopped the girls. At 4 am several , seemingly intoxicated,  guests returned to their room next door to me. They were very loud in the hallway; the noise continued after they  entered the room. Again, I called and security quieted them.  I stayed at your hotel to get a good nights rest in a hotel room that was clean with functioning components. That did not happen—both nights. I could also smell people smoking in rooms as I walked to my room. Laquinta has chosen to ignore my request for refund.",US

1329,www.google.com,2021-09-03T18:15:13.000Z,1,"AVANTSTAY, INC. - MY MANAGEMENT COMPANY","To: Dustin Abney  Subject: Re: AvantStay Dustin, Let me tell you a story of who we are.  You have just come aboard and learning the works of the organization. In January 2019 I was personally assured by Ben Gold that all my good furniture would be shrink wrapped.  That never came to be as we saw two years later, when 50% of our furniture, because it had not bee shrink wrapped was ruined, as was witnessed by many people including your workers.  At this point I would like to mention that not only Ben Gold had promised me that all furniture would be shrink wrapped, but it would be well cared for.  By being able to store my furnishings in our basement, AvantStay saved themselves thousand upon thousand of dollars worth of storage fees in Truckee, CA. When COVID hit, Bill and I were the first to offer a plausible solution to save the day and lowering the cost, for a period of time thereby allowing Avant Stay to continue staying in business.  We could have asked for an increase in rental payments after a one year period of time and did not. I found my lawn, trees, bushes, flowers ( upon my return home) never had they been cared for or watered.  We had an automatic sprinkler system.  Our garden was in shambles.  It took the gardening company two whole days with four  workers to bring the garden back to its previous state somewhat. Our microwave had been taken from the wall and never replaced by a like one.  Took 3 weeks of my work to obtain a new one, and I had to do all the work.  The seat to the toilet had been broken, and I had to replace it.  I wonder how many homeowners that are with AvantStay live to hear this entire story. The basement and garage areas were in shambles.  Took myself, my daughter, and two man to clean it up. Our beautiful beams that cost a great deal of money.  Your people had bore 3 HUGE holes in our beam to place a chair there, all without our permission.  WHAT?  WHEN IS THAT EVER O.K.? I had made an estimate of charges, just an estimate, of all the furniture that had been completely ruined by not being shrink wrapped as I agreed upon with Ben Gold on the onset of the lease.  Four wooden decorative boats were completely ruined and had to be thrown away completely.  Each had a cost of between $250.00 to $550.00.  Those were never even reported on the list of ruined items. When I recapped the present cost of the furniture, which was below market price, I waited four weeks to receive a reply.  A very very conservative estimate of between $3,500 and $3,800.  And that Sum did not include my ruined Four wooden boats.  Total reimbursement was $2,50O, vs. $3,800 asked for, and not received,  and that was also for allowing Avant Stay to place items in my basement vs. a storage facility which saved them $2,800 per month easily. After the workers from AvanStay stayed with me for about three days to fix things, they wanted to have nothing more to do with me including the on site manager.  I had to hire two additional men, out of pocket to complete all unfinished work by AvantStay, which cost me approximately  $1,000. One year, we had to pay half of the cost associated with the cleaning of the roof of accumulated snow as it was causing damage to the house, and AvantStay was not taking care of it. I could go on and on with the inaptidude of AvantStay, that during our relationship of two years got rid of at least three managers that I know of. Our outside of our home was ruined by woodpeckers as no one took the initiative to place the silver strips on the outside of the house.  And two men had to be called in to fix it completely.

1353,www.google.com,2021-08-30T18:16:18.000Z,2,Camp Tioga (Pennsylvania),"My Family attended a wedding at this location. I even flew a couple relatives in from out of state.   I will start with the numerous most disappointing points and ending on the positive points.  I gave this a two star rating for the following reasons: 1. Lodging- Most disappointing point.  Cabins were like rotting shacks that were not maintained, dirty, moldy, etc.  I checked out a few of them and some had upgrades like new wood on the walls but that was the best feature.  Overall the lodging was extremely poor! Not a place to prepare for a wedding with nice clothing.  One 10 inch mirror above the sink that my Mother-in-law could not even see her eyes in.  Does not even make the standards for a basic low level hotel room, at best a cheap hunting cabin for muddy, drunk hunters.  I paid $120 per person for two nights for 6 people, and left after the first night because it was so bad.  So if it means anything to you I left $360.00 on the table just to get the hell out of there.  In my opinion the owners are not being honest with people in reference to the accommodations and just taking their (My) money!!  Again, at best these cabins are low level hunting cabins, and if you have allergies forget it, too much mold.   2. Food - The food was supposed to be prepared by a chef.  If this is the case then the chef needs more staff, additional training, or both.  Most horderves were acceptable and not bad.  Nothing to write home about.  Maybe because they were supposed to be hot but came to us warm at best.  All of the main course food was cold and not pleasant to eat. The shrimp were very fishy and salty, not a good sign!! 3. Staff:  Not enough staff on location.  The staff members were running the entire time.  The owners do not take into consideration that older people attend the wedding event and their facility is on a mountain side with uneven grass, and stone trails that could put someone in a hospital, not to mention the lack of lighting on the cabin steps at night and in-between buildings.  They did not even offer a transport for older people or people with medical conditions to get from one building to another, again the cocktail hour was in a nice remodeled barn that was approximately 120 yards up a mountain side.  My mother-in-law was changing in and out of sneakers from event to event on the day of the wedding ceremony.  My one Son actually asked one of the staff members to give her a ride with one of the Golf carts and she never came back.  How would that look to have a 78 year old woman rolling down  a mountain side when you have multiple golf carts and side-by- side all terrain vehicles on hand! 4. The main wedding ceremony building was a very nice, newly built  shell of a wooden barn that had plastic removable walls to deal with inclement weather.  In addition there were very nice clean mobile bathrooms next to that building.   5. Lastly the cocktail hour was in a remodeled barn with a deck.  It was a nice setting but again getting up that mountain side with elderly people or people with medical conditions possesses a major issue.  If you were wondering about how I feel about exercise,  I am a lifetime fitness enthusiast so I embrace exercise, and so do all of my family members!  I have been an outdoorsman all of my life so that is not an issue either.  I hope this review serves to make Camp Tioga a better place because it has a lot of potential.",US

So i called a company out of network and they came out that night, so I had to pay out of pocket. Since I didn't get an authorization to fix the problem I  was told they couldn't reimburse me. After many call and complaints and speaking to someone in their authorization dept and was called a lair by one of those people they agree to pay me what it would of cost for someone they sent out would of charged. So when I received a check for half of what I paid, I said better then nothing. But then the took another 85.00 from that check. And when I called a few days later to cancel my policy with them I was informed I would have to pay the fees that they had just reimbursed me, so now i owe another 281.16 to a huge company that take more from the customers the they give or help them with.

Very dirty park, our caravan was also disgusting not cleaned before our visit there were very old biscuits left in the kitchen out of date, I cleaned green snotts from the bathroom sink, toilet also very dirty, caravan had not been swept or hovered inside we had to clean it ourselves it was not COVID-19 safe.staff drove past lots of waste blown from the bin area in front of our caravan it took two days to clean up. Dog waste all over the place, every activity we tried to book was fully booked the week we were there, we were unable to book any activity they were only available to book after we left, had to queue for hours to do anything. Food in restaurant was overpriced and very poor lots of the menu not available main meals and desserts, food was dry and crispy desserts were cold we sent them back to be changed well over £100 for food I would not feed to my dog. Walking along outside the complex a massive smell of weed daily. A member of staff 20 minutes before closing in the gift shop was rude shouting to a full shop that they were closing that we all had to leave or go and pay. Security on the live lounge stopping young kids seeing parents as they had not scanned the COVID app even though they had our details and knew how many people were with us these are only young kids. Swimming pool and changing area very dirty every visit we had. some pools closed the swimming pool is a health and safety issue also pool was not well managed life guards stood watching as teenagers running and jumping into the pool on top of families with kids in arm bands learning to swim. Entertainment was very poor. I understand Covid restrictions but greed has took over.we normally love haven every year but will not be returning after this experience. Not Covid-19 safe. We are still waiting back at home for a request  made on arrival 7 days ago to be contacted about the standard of cleaning in our caravan. Staff I never seen anyone who looked like they wanted to be there or help us. AVOID you will regret going.",GB

The original Venue which I had booked for my Sons Wedding was shut down by Nassau County for some unknown issues. That happened  closet to 6 days before the wedding which was 8/13/21. I scrambled with high anxiety to figure out what I was going to do. One of the Venues I reached out to was Leonard’s in hysteria and I spoke with their GM Gary who promised me he had a room available for that following Friday and that he would get back to me within the next morning. When I received his quote as he promised the next morning he followed up with a call and gave me an appointment to come in and meet with Francesca. I did and Francesca put me at ease once she showed me what Leonard’s had to offer. I signed a contact on the spot and immediately both Francesca and Leonard’s were nothing but accommodating.  The day of my Sons wedding, I must say everyone from my Host, to the servers, to the bartenders, security and even the Valet staff were all nothing but Amazing, attentive, responsive and everything a Mom would need on her Sons wedding. The ceremony area, cocktail hour and reception room were perfect. Food was just perfect.  I am grateful for Leonard’s Palazzos accommodations, service and I will definitely call on them again should i need  to book another venue in the future.  I wish I remembered the names of all the staff members to mention here.  Thank you Leonard’s Palazzo",US

I was quoted 1 truck and 7-9 hours. I was billed for 12 hours with a second truck. When I complained to VLAD the Franchisee of Bowmanville, he was very rude. He kept lying and talking over me. When I asked for his last name, he refused and told me to look it up on a business card and when I asked for the customer service number he again refused and told me to google it if I wanted it. He also claimed that he was the owner of the entire company and when backed into a corner, finally admitted that he is in charge of ONLY the Bowmanville site. I wrote an email to the head office which I have yet to hear a reply from. Horrible company that takes their time and charges almost double the quote. Beware your quote will be completely wrong!!

Dr. Patel offered to come to our home to check up on him. My husband was so impressed, but insisted going to his office. His staff is very professional and educated. I have referred many friends to his office because of the trust I have in him. Dr. Patel does not need to look in his notes to remember everyone's name  in my family. His office takes my blood work at my well checkups, and by the following day I know my results. If anyone in my family is ill, we do not have to wait for an appointment. Dr. Patel will always make time to see his sick patients the same day. I feel like Dr. Patel is a part of my family. That is very rare this day and age.",US

We recently purchased a Vanleigh Vilano 5th Wheel from them.  I never thought I would really enjoy the process of buying a new recreational trailer. From my first contact with their internet support team the process just got better. Carl Gwin, my first contact and process advisor, was simply outstanding.  He was professional, knowledgeable, and accessible, even on his off days and hours. He followed through on all aspects of the sale. Working with Carl, it took about thirty minutes to nail down the unit I wanted, and the best part, La Mesa RV offers their bottom line price up front. No need to haggle with a sales manager for a better deal. It was a very good price as well. So either you want the unit and the deal or not. The owners of La Mesa RV have a very well organized team and smooth sales process. The sales guys are not on commission. I think this helps keep the customers needs first. As the sale progressed I had an opportunity to work with quite a few other players. I would like to shout out to some of then for all their assistance; -Carl Gwinn, internet and inside sales.

He required money in advance of a month's worth of lessons.  He also induced me to take two lessons per week.  He overwhelmed me with his stories of success in Nashville recording studios.  I gave him $175.00.  I decided after the conversation that taking a lesson Wednesday and Friday was not conducive to learning much between lessons.  I also found that my fingers had become too sore to perform my fingerstick blood tests.  I called and said I couldn't do the lessons, after one lesson and several days' practice.  He refused to give me a refund of $150.00, which is less the one lesson.  He said, HERE IT COMES, he would only give a refund if he found someone else to fill my slot.   REALLY??? He's walking around with my money for future lessons.  Does anyone believe that he would make any effort to fill the two slots?  I leave the answer to this question to the readers.  I have encountered cons, slimy operators, and law 'benders' in my 76 years, and I feel the similarity immensely.  The Fret Shop refunded money spent on guitar equipment, Gretsch refunded money spent on the guitar, but Ron Jeffreys feels he is due a free ride not having to provide the lessons he signed up for with me and no refund for two lessons a week for one month. Common human courtesy and good business practices have no part in his dealings, evidently.  I have recorded all conversations with him, as I do with all business transactions.

Two and three quarter years later we have nothing but the ICF shell (which he didn’t even properly protect before piling dirt up around the base), the roof and metal studs. We even shelled out an additional $18,500+ in cash to help him move forward. And what did we get? Excuse after excuse after excuse for why he couldn’t make progress and a demand for yet another $56,000 for even more! Ron told us in Oct of 2020 that the project had been under priced from the start and admitted he never really reviewed contracts before signing them. Therefore he was “forced” to increase our build price by 20 to 25% if we wanted it completed as contracted for. The man is a shyster, a liar and a fraud. In fact, he defrauded more than 20 couples/families over the last two years, leaving many without a home or the hard earned money they paid him. I wouldn’t recommend Marra Construction or their re-branded company Florida ICF Builders, LLC to build a dog house! Subs won’t work for him because he doesn’t pay the people who DO work on his projects. Steer clear of Ron Marra Construction and Florida ICF Builders. Check out ALL their reviews here, on Buildzoom, and on their social media accounts. The only good reviews they have were written by employees (who no longer have jobs). Choose better … choose anyone but a Marra Construction in SW Florida!",US

We had just bought the car on the preceding Monday (from a Panama City dealership). Living in Clarksville, Florida, we were traveling to Madison, Florida, for supper. Approaching Midway, several dash warning lights came on and I proceeded to the shoulder of the Interstate to evaluate our situation. Fast forwarding, after a trip by Auto Zone, and my personal mechanic, where both confirmed the main problem to be the Transmission Valve Body Assembly, my mechanic suggested I’d be best off taking it to the dealer for service as Subaru transmissions are a little different. I drove across Tallahassee to Proctor Subaru, arriving between 3 and 4 PM on Friday afternoon, where I spoke with service writer Billy Swindell. Billy politely explained that service work was done by appointment. Ultimately, he agreed to take it in, making it clear that he couldn’t promise when they’d be able to get to it. (We both agreed on my limited options.) I arranged for a ride back to Clarksville with dashed hopes. Imagine my shock when, early Saturday morning, I received a call from Billy Swindell. Billy explained that the car had been checked out (already), the problem was confirmed, they had the parts on hand and that, if I accepted the estimate & gave the go ahead they could have it ready Monday, and Tuesday at the latest. Early Monday morning, I received a call from Billy Swindell and was given the fantastic news that my Subaru was ready. I have to say, at 68 years old, I’ve never been so pleased with the response from a dealership service department as I was with Billy Swindell and the folks at Proctor’s Subaru. I can not say enough good things about my experience there, and I’ll gladly share that opinion with everyone. Thanks Billy, and thank you to the Proctor Subaru dealership!",US

I am a disabled veteran and can hardly walk. The Rocco management called me and said that the next time that the gate was having problems that they would not deliver my food after I paid for it. Not only that, I gave the delivery man a 20% tip and a little extra for delivering my food and thanked him. Reminder, it is only a very, very short distance to walk. If I could walk, I would have gotten my food. I have been a customer of Rocco's since 2008 and for a disabled veteran to be treated this way is outrighteous. I will remind Rocco that they can't discriminate a disabled person as it is in the Constitution in the 1991 Disabiility Act in the Constitution. Rocco's violated my 1964 Civil Rights too. It would be the same thing if they refused delivery to a person because of their race and ethnic background. Men and women who have served in the United States military and have given their lives and are buried in Arlington National Cemetery, and at other military cemeteries too, so Rocco can have their business and their freedom. I found out that they have no respect for people who have served in the millitary and who are disabled. Not only that, they have disrepected and violated the Constitution of the United States. The owner also lived next door to me that had own the Rocco's business and I was friends with her before she had to take care of her mother in Florida and had sell her Rocco business to the new owner. I have been a loyal customer since 2008 and spent 1,000s of dollars of food deliveries to Rocco's and I had never had a problem and this delivery person was incovenient a little bit because he had to walk a very, very short distance to deliver my food. Plus I gave him a 20% plus tip and a little extra because my gate was out of order and I told him thank you. I intend to let other veterans know not to go to Rocco's because they do not support veterans' rights who are disabled. If Rocco's wants to loose some of their business by discriminating against veterans and disabled people, and perhaps they might be getting lawsuits from other people.

1638,www.google.com,2021-07-05T17:47:49.000Z,1,Heart Broken,"Our boating experience at LLM was a year-old event that ended in heartbreak.  Once we signed an almost $40,000 contract with LLM, we were treated as a nuisance when focused to call them about the missing items in the signed contract.  We attempted to work over a year with LLM Service Department Staff to resolve the missing items with no luck, empty promises and ""the check is in the mail"".    It was clear that LLM had no plans on honoring the signed contract.  I even reached out to the Better Business Bureau to help resolve these many issues, who also had no luck with a response from LLM.  In the end, My husband and I had to make the heart wrenching decision to sell our beloved boat back to LLM.  We just cannot work with people who disregard signed contracts... or their word for that matter. 40,000.00 may not be a lot of money to LLM, but it is to these Two Essential workers.  Buying a boat is big investment that requires a lot of servicing so warrantees are honored.  That is not to be taken lightly.  We have saved many emails, VM and conversations backing up the statements above. I'm choosing not to get into details as it really was a long year of endless promises, disrespect and outright lies from the service department staff. James at LLM did make arrangements to have the boat picked up after purchasing it back. We thought this was really a turning point in regards to their integrity.. We were told pick up time would be 9:30 am. Unfortunately, whoever was driving the LLM truck arrived at 8:40 am came on our property, took the boat without attempting to knock on our door and left with our boat's license plate still attached.  Both of which is illegal... but then again not honoring a signed contract is illegal as well..  LLM please send our boat's license plate back. At this point my husband and myself can't take stomach calling LLM one more time and be treated with disrespect.",US

To complete the final selling transaction they handled everything and all what I had to do was to sign and electronic sales document and they sent me a check very quickly via the mail.

Our local handyman co, based out of Navarre Florida is a one man disaster of a company. He said he was licensed. He isn’t.  He quoted us 1500 for plumbing, bath and 3/4 tile install. I’m learning it wasn’t legal for him to even work on the plumbing as he isn’t licensed. After three days of work we are left with chipped tiles, a drain that doesn’t hold water, a faucet that hangs out of the wall and a shower head that does the same. His pictures on his FB do not reflect the work we received. We were surprised when he said he was finished but we still paid him in good faith as he said there is a one year warranty on his work. He said the following Monday he would come by and fix the problem. Monday came and went. Anthony made us wait all day at the house before saying he wouldn’t be there. He said he would get back with us when he had time. A day and a half went by before he said okay Wednesday morning he would show up. Wednesday morning came and he said not in the morning now maybe later. Again we waited all day with no Anthony. We called and texted (not rudely mine you just gentle..  could we please get a window so we can get other things done today?) with no response. Finally he shut off his phone. Since we could not get ahold of Anthony via his phone we wrote a message on his Facebook: ‘our local handyman co’ for him to contact us (as he was not responding via telephone) so he could please let us know when he would be coming to fix our unfinished/damaged shower. This angered Anthony very much. He called right away and said because we posted a comment on Facebook he would no longer show up to fix his botched job. We said ok. If that’s your stance that’s fine we will hire someone else to fix your mistakes and you can either pay us for it or we have to file a civil claim against him. He said “f you you b*tch, I’m not a dog who jumps when you tell him to, you can’t tell me to be wherever you want whenever you want, and I know you aren’t takin me to claims court over a 25 cent piece”. While he was yelling at me I tried to tell him he was being unreasonable all we wanted was for our shower to work and that HE made the appointment with US we didn’t dictate to him where and when to be and it was HIS choice not to answer his phone; furthermore, because of him we have not had a working shower for a week, we missed two days of work waiting for him, and it isn’t a 25 cent job we are stuck with. The part used to secure hardware might have cost that much, but his inability to do the job right the first time (according to a reputable plumber who is costing me 140 dollars an hour) is SO BAD it’s going to run me around 500 dollars. Either the tile needs to be removed from the front of the shower to secure all of the fixtures correctly (which leaves me needing to hire someone to replace the tile and cement backer board in that area) OR the drywall from The room behind the bathroom has to be removed (which would leave me with a hole in my kids wall until I hire someone to fix that).  In short I made a GRAVE MISTAKE hiring this man! He ruined our bathroom, ghosted us, cussed me out, and told me to go f myself...  all for asking him to fix his mistake which he supposedly backed with a one year warranty. I’m going to post pictures of this job on Pinterest under our local handyman co so people can see we aren’t exaggerating. Huge gaping holes left in our walls. Just crazy. I honestly think he knows his skill level is not high enough to fix the fubar he put us in which is why we were ghosted and then cussed out.  Live and learn but I hope you can learn from my mistake.",US
1685,www.google.com,2021-06-21T23:38:24.000Z,1,Prospective Client Beware of NE Star Remodeling and Contstruction,"I find this very hard to write after giving a high review in January for the New England Star Remodeling & Construction Company.  We contracted Andre in late September 2020 to paint our house (including the deck, railing replacement where needed and repair of siding where needed).  Andre, the owner, assured us he was a man of integrity and his word was his bond.  A crew of three people showed in early October 2020.  That lasted for one day (the start), after that there was usually just one person for a 5,000 sq ft home.  We were patient and never complained.  Because there was only one person (usually Kai, extremely hard working and polite) scrapping, prepping and then painting the house the job continued into December.  So cold at times the paint never took and had to be scraped and repainted.  Finally, the job was totally completed 12/31/20 with the remaining balance paid in full.  As luck would have it, the winter wasn’t kind to the deck nor the railings as over half had/has peeled and bubbled.  I tried for weeks in March 2021 to reach Andre at the only number I had.  Sending him pictures of what has/had happened to the deck/railing.  Finally, a response, where he stated that it was because it was too cold when applied.  Really?

I was told she had nothing but allergies!  She was filled with injections that DID NOTHING for her along with medications that were ridiculously priced and again that did nothing!!  5 days after her last visit with Dewey I’m in another veterinary office with her in critical condition and them saying she was on oxygen and had a very bad infection!  They’re telling me the rash on her body was NOT allergies, but was in fact signs of trouble from infection!!!  She was never treated just given more shots and new medications and here she was suffering inside!  (All I was told was many pets were coming in suffering from allergies) My 8 month beautiful blue and green-eyed Husky died all because Dewey Vet did NOTHING for her!!  She lost her life and I didn’t get to enjoy loving her for many year’s because her symptoms were not taken seriously !  She didn’t  have to die SHE WAS MURDERED by lack of care!!!!!  As a pet mom you take your babies into veterinarians offices in hopes they will properly diagnose and care for your kids basicaly!!! Jenuh was not cared for!  This vet told me her impacted teeth (Adult teeth came in but baby teeth didn’t fall out) wasn’t urgent she could get them out when they spayed her too which I said I was told by other vet that I should wait between 1-1.5 years old which he blew off and said NOT TRUE!  (I read about the urgency to pull teeth online  yet this was also blown off as nothing) His old school veterinary services may actually be OUTDATED garbage!  Maybe it’s time to retire!!!!   My girl is gone!  I spent money to save her and all I got was a dead dog and a sad and empty home!  She’s gone and I won’t ever see her again all because her symptoms weren’t taken serious and an assumption was made that she was like any other dog who came in with allergies!  I followed what I was I was told!  I kept her indoors as much as possible to keep her away from what may have made her allergic! I gave her a bath after her June 3rd appointment and washed her bed covers.   But nothing came of it, but her being gone!!  I’m left with hair, toys, other supplies, stupid medications and sadness!!  I called to ask to talk with vet or if I could leave a message for him to return my call and all I got was “if he has time to”.  So I explain my Jenuh is dead and this guy just says “ok!”  Lacking of compassion you shouldn’t be at the front counter or answering phones!  YOU SUCK!  I asked for vets boss he tells me he’s the boss I say no like he has to answer to someone who owns the company he says Steven Scott here’s his email we don’t give out his phone number!  What the heck you people kill my dog and you don’t provide me with a number?  So it’s ok if this happens over and over to other pets!??  I’m just so angry!!!!!!!

My partner and I made an online lunch booking for 13:15 on the 13 June 2021 (today). On arrival at 13:10, we were met at reception by a young gentleman who advised us that they didn't have any booking for us. The booking was, however, confirmed, via email, for that time, for 2 guests under reservation number 74436719. Needless to say there was a debate between him and a female colleague regarding the booking. He advises that it was scratched off a list and she advised that it wasn't received. Long story short, we were offered a table for two.  The gentleman took our drinks order of 1 alcohol-free beer and a glass of Shiraz. 10 minutes later he took our meal order - we ordered a single pizza. That was the last time we had any interaction with the wait staff. No checking in with us to offer another round of drinks or to appraise us of the waiting time for the pizza. After waiting an hour and 15 minutes, and watching a family to the left of us receive their copious meal order, albeit that they had arrived a long time after we had, I approached the front desk. 4 staff were milling around and eventually, a female staff member to my left asked someone to assist me. I asked for the bill as I had no intention of waiting any longer. When told that the bill included the pizza, I asked where the pizza was. They advised that we'd received it. I questioned that statement and they then had a look at their kitchen orders and our pizza order hadn't even been delivered to the kitchen.  Now, I can understand if things get overlooked, however, the tone and attitude of the staff assisting me was condescending and overtly defensive. They knew that they had messed things up, however, no apology was given, neither did they ask how they could fix things. I advised that I wasn't going to pay for the pizza, given that I hadn't received it, and it hadn't been assembled yet.  Long and short of it - we made an online booking (doing the right thing). They didn't even know about it. Why have a system if you don't use or monitor it. PS: Guests to the right of us had also booked online and were told that their booking didn't exist - so much for someone monitoring it. Secondly, we were given our drinks and then left to get on with our lives. People around us were regularly trying to get the wait staff's attention. I'm sure that the restaurants camera's will attest to this. Thirdly; when I raised the matter with the staff, their defensive attitudes left a sour taste in ones mouth. Suggestions: 1. Don't bother making the drive out to visit this venue. 2. Staff need customer service retraining. 3. Have someone man your online booking system. If I could provide a zero star rating I would, however, I'll give the obligatory 1-star rating it doesn't deserve.",NZ

In 2018, this company was used by our Insurance to install a brand new furnace. We recently had issues with our other furnace and had a very professional company come out and quote us just to get some numbers. When he saw our three year old furnace, he couldn't believe how it was installed. This is a detailed email that he sent me: The company that installed the furnace definitely did not install the unit properly.  They should have had a whole new 20 amp circuit ran from the panel to the furnace with 12g wire and 20 amp breaker and switch per installation instructions.  The rough estimate to have this done by a licensed professional would be around $450.  They also failed to properly bring in return air to both sides of the blower motor. Again, something that any professional company would have known to do on a 5 ton system like you have.  Unfortunately the only way to correct this is to remove and reinstall the furnace on a proper 7"" return box bringing in the air necessary through the bottom and side of the furnace blower compartment. Roughly $800 to properly reinstall the furnace. There was excessive rust and water damage from the poor installation as that was not installed properly either.  No permits were pulled because it would have never passed in the way it was installed and would have failed to meet state code and manufacturer installation instructions. I was so upset that everything was done improperly! Being they didn't upgrade the panel, he told us we were lucky because it could burn out the wires or cause a fire, but most likely would trip the circuit first. Still, the possibility doesn't sit well with me. If you are thinking about using this company, OR AMERICAN HOME SHIELD Insurance to protect your appliances think again because they were the ones that used this company to install the furnace. You should have them pull permits. In my opinion, I would bypass J.E. Johnson and American Home Shield, and find someone that knows how to properly install a system.",US

Goodness, from the appetizers to the main dishes this place is unreal.  First of all whoever is doing the cooking knows their craft.  The tastes were amazing, the portions were more than generous, and the tastes were addictive.   Just to give you a few tips of things to try.  The spicy meatballs and the risotto balls are a must.   We ordered the bucatini with ramps, and the gnocchi with mushrooms.  Beyond delicious.  We also ordered the lemon pasta with artichokes, and it was equally delicious.  We tried leaving room for dessert because we heard it is off the charts yummy.  So glad we did.  We ordered the olive oil cake and the vanilla with strawberries.  The vanilla was a toss between flan and pudding....and wow.  All I can say for all the desserts that hit our table was wow.

They provide ""services"" as bait to mine the world's data for them","I first had a bad feeling about Google many years ago when I began to notice them becoming all pervasive on the internet and on local computers. It was as if they were being forced on us. When Chrome was first installed on some network desktops I was using, I found that Firefox browser wouldn't load. When I raised the issue with staff at the centre, they told me ""Use Google Chrome!"" But I refused that because I wanted Firefox, not Chrome. Even then I could see Google shaping to become another monopoly like Microsoft. Later I found out they had been greatly seed funded into that position by CIA venture capital company In-Q-Tel. Co-founder Larry Page also worked for the Pentagon's sinister DARPA for 10 years before starting Google, so they are basically the creation of DARPA who say they created the internet. Google are massively tracking us all around the internet not only on websites but also on our smartphone apps. They have Tracker Networks on over 75% of the world's top 1 million websites. This is all without our knowledge or informed consent. It is legally questionable. They build detailed personal profiles on us and then sell these to advertisers. They track us to websites we definitely don't want them to track us to. The DuckDuckGo app reveals and blocks their tracking activity on your phone. VPNs also block them. Startpage.com and duckduckgo.com are much more private search engines. Google is a DARPA front. Google are notorious censors that removed 6 out of 7 related reviews of mine in order to cover up a horrific pattern of corruption and abuse from English police, solicitors and companies! They did this without notification or explanation and refused to respond to enquiries from me. They also prevented me from re-editing the reviews or even posting one star without any text at all! Then when I gave Google Maps iOS app a one star review, wrote of their removal of my 6 reviews and mentioned their seed funding by the CIA, they secretly reported my truthful review to Apple App Store, who blocked my updated reviews and removed an earlier edit of the review they had previously allowed. On behalf of Google, Apple have blocked me from an honest review of Google Maps and have refused to respond to many queries from me as to why they have done this. I am a customer of Apple, not Google. I own a MacBook Pro, iPhone 8+, iPhone 5s, yet Apple has removed my review to cover up for Google who removed more than 6 of my reviews.

We have visited here several times in past but today the food was absolutely diabolical! and that’s an understatement. The children wanted sausage and mash the waitress took the order to come no tell us there was no sausage so we then ordered pizza to be told no pizza so the only the thing on children’s menu was steak or pasta . Two older boys had steak two year old granddaughter had pasta. Omg! The steak was full of blood extremely rare what 7 year old would eat that as tough as anything! So basically they are peas as chips were horrible as well. The best was the pasta a ton of alphabet shapes with a slice of burnt garlic bread . Alphabet shapes ???? Not real pasta which retail at 55p in Tesco and they charged us 4.95 ! What a joke so children were left hungry adults had a baguette which was not at all appetising but better than the poor kids. I’ve never been in a pub and kids had tinned pasta shapes ! On complaining (as no one came to ask if all ok) the waitress had nothing to say and walked off no one came out to us so we left never ever to return! Beware white lion at bramcote.,GB

Back in December 2020, as the car I was looking to lease was a new model, I could not find much detail about it on the internet, however, after contacting Vantage and speaking to Lee, he meticulously sought out the information, including model spec of the various lineups available, and from that I was able to decide the 1.2  C4 Shine Plus auto would be the perfect car for my needs. Before Lee got me that information, I was very close to signing up for a car from another dealer, but after comparison, using the information Lee had provided, I was able to make my mind up for the C4.  Throughout the ordering process right up to delivery of the vehicle, Lee and other members of the sales team at Vantage Blackpool have regularly updated me about the changing delivery schedule due to the impact of Covid19 and other issues affecting production. This was very reassuring.  The 2021 model C4 is a brilliant family car, and I am already feeling very at home with it. Lee guided me through its many driver friendly features, as well as providing a pre delivery link to the online version of the instruction manual so I had a chance to familiarise myself before the hand over.  On handover by Lee, the process was very professional, friendly and  thorough. In pre-registering my vehicle, Lee and the team had even managed to get a 21 plate with suffix letters similar to my name - which was a nice extra touch by them. This was my first experience of obtaining a new car from Vantage Blackpool and I would gladly recommend any friends or family members, considering a new or quality used car to check out Vantage Blackpool  before committing to a purchase elsewhere - I am certainly very glad I did.",GB

1835,www.google.com,2021-05-13T00:18:14.000Z,1,Camp Mac changed the contract and kept our money,"Camp Mac was not the place we thought it was 😢 BEWARE!!!! I know this is a lengthy posts so those of you who want the Cliff Notes, here you go: IS IT LEGAL TO ADD REQUIREMENTS TO A CONTRACT/AGREEMENT?   CAMP MAC DECIDED TO ADD A COVID TESTING REQUIREMENT FOR THEIR SUMMER CAMPS AFTER WE PAID THEM THE FULL AMOUNT AND THEN KEPT $2500 TO WITHDRAW OUR KIDS FROM CAMP. Camp Mac. A Christian Summer Camp in the Cheaha Mountains of Talladega County, Alabama.  They have lots of activities for kids including horse back riding, archery, water skiing, etc.  Seems ideal, right?  Well we thought so too!  That’s why we signed up Levon and Loretta for an 11 day camp on June 1.  They have a huge list of items to buy to prepare for camp and we had them all ready to go, signed all the medical forms, releases, photos, life history, paid the full cost ($6190). After 8 long months of wearing masks for 8 hours a day, our kids were super excited to spend their first ever time away from home in this Christian environment without Covid mandates. Even grandma Ivey had removed the mask mandate!  Finally, the kids were going to have the summer of their lives!  And they deserved it after all they’ve been through.  Yes, wearing masks for this long has caused them issues…. that’s why I made sure that they would not have to wear them during this camp and had many conversations about that with the administrators prior to signing them up.  THEN COMES THE PROBLEM.  On April 30, one day prior to their NO REFUND POLICY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, and the last day of their ONLY HALF BACK REFUND IF YOU CANCEL, they send an email.  The subject line was Pre-Arrival Testing - Please Read!  I had already read their lengthy parent handbook and was aware of their pre-camp lice check prior to entering campgrounds and honestly thought the email was regarding that, as probably many others did.  I didn’t read it immediately but kept thinking about it in my mind, wondering if it could possibly be something else.  Before the day was over, I made time to read the email and to my surprise they were referring to a COVID TEST prior to camp!  Nowhere in the handbook did it mention Covid testing and nowhere in our many conversations with the administrators did they ever mention the possibility of Covid testing.  The company that was to administer the test is called Grapefruit. With a little digging, I found that they purchase their medical supplies from a company called McKesson who purchases their Covid tests from China.  The same place that Covid originated.  To force my kids to stick a nasal swab up their nose to check for Covid, even though they have ZERO symptoms of Covid, from a source where the actual virus originated was a problem for me.  Not only do I not trust CHINA, I do not trust WHO, the CDC, and now CAMP MAC!  These tests are not REQUIRED for Camp Mac to operate, they are a personal choice that they made. Regardless of how you feel about COVID, VACCINES, TESTING, etc. the bottom line is this.  Is it LEGAL to change a contractual agreement? Can you add stipulations or requirements to an agreement after the fact?  I think not!  But apparently, this Christian company not only believes that it is okay to demand these tests, they have decided to keep $2500 of my money for withdrawing my children from their camp because I refuse to subject my healthy kids to testing.  Even though the camp has not even started and it was THEM who waited until April 30 to tell us about the TESTING REQUIREMENT.  I will make this my personal mission to fight for what is right here.  If you want to test healthy kids for your camp, go ahead.  But don’t collect people’s money without telling them that is your plan and then when they don’t agree with you, refuse to release their money.  This is just wrong on so many levels!  So we will see you in court CAMP MAC. And we will be sueing you for not only the $2500, but for all the items we purchased for camp as well as the mental anguish/stress this has caused our family.  I am truly blown away that this CHRISTIAN company feels that they are entitled to keep $2500 over this, especially knowing that I have 3 KIDS who were planning on attending camp mac every summer.  I will make sure I tell everyone I know about your CHRISTIAN ways and encourage them to tell others as well.  Your idea of Christianity and mine are completely different.  Let’s see what the legal system thinks of your actions. I encourage everyone to share this post because that is what it is going to take to stop these WOKE companies from continuing with their tyrannical leadership.

So the years passed, and my said Mother-in-law, always with us, is 102 years old, in good shape, but not able to drive alone anymore. Time was come to sale the car. Ajay, my mecanic advisor, explained me that before, I had to let them change and adjust the power steering rack (la crémaillère de direction). So, I did as explained, and finally a young man from Québec city bought with proud this 61000 kilometers old car. Thank you Canadian Tire for all these years of maintenance and repairs! And I don't forget how good the guidances and technical advices delivered to me by Ajay have been so precious.

I asked at other storage locations around Patricia's location and they said...""You want us to hold on to it you start paying today""  She has also assured me that if I needed a week on top of the time I paid at the end of my commitment, she would price is out as a week.. I asked this of others and they said ""you have to pay for another month""..  This is customer service at it's finest and what other businesses should be doing as well.  Yes she may lose a dollar or 2 here and there, but makes it up 10 fold on customer returns.  Good service, deserves repeat service..

A precarious 24 inch diameter x 30 foot overhang over neighbor's gazebo was safely removed.  The extended boom with a man-lift was not an option as surrounding overhead electrical utility wires and distance to access the site prevented the use of the boom. The only option was block and tackle and rope and the expertise of the lead trimmer strategically planning out the course and safely proceeding.  Neither surrounding property was affected other than the flakes of sawdust that were cleaned upon completion. Every section that was cut was dropped safely and slowly into owners yard and disposed of immediately in the shredder and with large limbs loaded onto the truck. Noise was at a minimum. Cleanup was better than satisfactory. Duration of work was timely. A word of advice for the DIY backyard tree trimmers —let these pros at Beswick do the work—the danger and liability to self and property are beyond the scope of the DIY'rs let alone the lack of skill and expertise.

I had order a patio door back in July of 2020 and did not arrived until September because of Covid-19. Anyway the installers came in September and installed my brand new patio door. However, two weeks later, there was a big rain during the entire night, and we find out that there was water coming underneath the patio door the following day. I called the HD installers and they sent someone to check it out. They put caulking around the entire frame of the door. Two weeks later, there was another ice/rain storm and water was coming in again. I called HD again, the same guy show up and took a look at the door, and after inspecting the door around, he told us that there was a crack at the bottom of the door. Therefore, he was going to order a new door, and they will come back once the new door have arrived. By then, I called HD and I open a claim for damages to my hardwood floors. Their liability insurance contact me after couple weeks, ""Segdwick Insurance"". I had three different male adjusters and a female supervisor involved in the claim, and they were all horrible at their job. After submitting pictures, videos, bills, invoice of the damage to my floor. They all had no clue of were all my information was, since I had to re-email everything back to them individually. These segdwick people are very incompetent on doing their jobs, it seems covid-19 affected their brains. December came around and my patio door had arrived. The installer came in and replaced the broken patio door. So far this new door, its working correctly, no more water damage or complaints so far. Now, in late January, my claim was sent to Simonton Insurance, since it appears that the manufacture of the door should be responsible for the damages. After waiting for so long, we decided to replace our hardwood floors, and just wait for reimbursement from the insurance. After two months dealing with Simonton, and sending again all my pictures, videos, bills, invoices for the damage floors, my claim was denied at the end. These are the Simonton claim manager words ""A cracked mainframe does not always signify a defective product as several other issues can put stress on any frame. We had no knowledge of the damage to our floors until after the fact which negated our ability to assess damage or cause. They also told me that at this time, they can only ask that I need to reach out to Sedgwick if I wanted to pursue my claim.  In fact, I called Segdwick and they had no idea that my claim was denied with Simonton. I ask to speak to a manager, and I was told that was impossible. I ask the representative to leave a message to the manager to call me ASAP to discuss about my claim, and specifically told them that I did not want it to speak to any of the previous adjusters or supervisors, since they took forever in my claim, and besides they do not do their jobs and kept loosing all my emails, and information. The manager never called, but somebody else did, asking me for Simonton's letter, and to sent back all my information, like video, picture, bills, invoices. This is a joke, Four people in Segwick already had all my information into their system and they still ask me for the same BS information. I already sent everything again this past Friday the 26th, and still have not heard anything back from them. I am so tired to be the one calling them to check the status of my claim. I just want HD to pay for the damages caused to my floors. Then, they can fight within them of who's fault belong to. Segwick is trying to figure out whom to blame, the manufacture or the installers. It's been almost six months and nothing is been done. Therefore, please think twice before hiring HD for any type of installation. I will sent a copy to yelp, and to the BBB. I will also contact my credit card company to dispute HD charges until they reimburse me for the damage floors.",US

I contacted google who offered to send me a new thermostat and told me I would need to return the old one but until they received my old product they would place a hold transaction on my account of £219. Once they received the faulty thermostat that held transaction would be cancelled and not taken.  I packaged and returned the faulty thermostat exactly as directed and the package was tracked with the courier they told me to use (DHL) and sent on the 4th March 2021. On the 23rd March I was charged the £219 by google despite me sending the faulty thermostat as instructed within the correct time frame (before March 22nd).  I have since tried to rectify this issue with google but in all honesty they are proving anything but helpful and are disinterested in assisting me with this issue. I find it extremely frustrating that I’ve followed their guidelines for returning the faulty product but I’ve still been charged. I’m not sure what else they expected or still expect me to do, I’m am being offered very little in the way of resolve. I’ve since done some research online and it seems this is something google have done to a large volume of their customers.  I had a sense that something like this would happen and took pictures of all the relevant paperwork and packaging before posting the product off and I still have the courier receipt which I sent to google, via email. This didn’t make any difference to the progression of the issue.

(Very Disappointed.),"When I sold my car to CARVANA it was a great experience, everything was flawless, they looked it over, we sign some papers, wrote the check, and they took it away.  With that type of satisfying experience, one would figure buying a car from them would be just as flawless right?  WELLLL....The car I selected was a 2015 BMW 650I, beautiful car, LOTS OF POWER. They showed up late, but it was cool, had me outside as if I was waiting on the mailman to drop off a government check...LOL...Carvana use to offer 4,189 miles with a 7 day money back guarantee if you don't want the vehicle. Now they offer 400 miles which is very unrealistic.  You could at least offer 1500 miles or shorten the days to match the 400 miles...2 days or 1.   Back to why I'm writing the opposite review of what I thought I was going to write earlier.  So, on the third day, still within my 7 day window...the check engine light came on as I leaving the parking lot.  I scheduled to have a diagnostic check with BMW that same day. Turns out the air mixture was too lean (crankcase line broken) air was getting into intake system.  Now SilverRock.Inc the warranty company they use was great.  They approve the repair over the phone and I walked away with a $50 deductible which CARVANA is going to reimburse.  Now so far, you are probably wondering why give them 3 stars.  Ok...Let me tell you. Carvana took my 2015 BMW 535I when they dropped off the BMW 650I.  Carvana says, you are allowed to swap vehicles within 7 days. I decided to swap over to the 2015 BMW 640I, 3.0 six cylinder, turbo 315 hp. Should be a bit more friendly on the gas considering my occupation.  Swapping isn't the problem either, actually it was a great experience as well.  Now you are really confused and think I'm just complaining right...I'm not hold on.  Carvana tells me that the swap will not be delivered until next week March 30.  In the mean time, you have to keep an eye on the 400 miles. I'm entitled to swap but I can't drive over 400 miles. You took my car and left me a lease.  I still have to work but I can't drive over 400 miles. If you do, its $1 per mile.  Why not leave my car and take it once the decision is made. Either you will return to pick up my car or yours.  Or as I said before, give 1500 miles, make it more realistic to a 7 day trial period.  Why am I being penalized for your policy?  I called to check on this because I know the value of this car and to have more miles on it, doesn't help.  All this is probably in the paperwork but do we read all the paperwork and fine print ""No"".  So, who can I blame...""ME"". But i have this sexy, expensive vehicle in my drive way that I can't drive unless I go take out $400 for the week in order to go to work.  Now, Carvana did show mercy and give me a 200 mile extension, but that isn't much better.  It will get me 2 days to work and home.  This is the reason for the 3 star review. If you can't get the swap to the person within a reasonable time, take that option away, or extend the miles to 2000 miles or 100 days.  You say the car is inspected with a 150 point check. I guess that doesn't count wheel alignment because the car needed that as well.  Now, I understand the car is used not brand new. I don't have a problem paying for a wheel alignment because if you are going to complain about the maintenance get a different car. I get it...I'm just upset and disappointed in the 400 miles and not getting the swap alot sooner.",US

My teeth have always been particularly sensitive, so having essentially painless procedures has made my dental appointments a pleasure to schedule. Dr Dees' entire staff are compassionate and highly skilled at their relative positions. I found that even the secretarial assistants had a quite remarkable command of the intricate Insurance rules and difficult qualifications and also went out of their way to give me timely support for cleaning notifications for example. I was also pleasantly surprised by the patience and knowledge of Dr Dees' personal surgical attendants who knew exactly when and how to make his operations possible.

When they discuss with you about the service they will present you a reasonable estimates. You don't know this the trick to catch the customer. They will ask you to accept and sign. After the services were done, the actual payment will be much higher than the estimate. After a long struggle I found AFD Avon managed by Dr. Mark a Booher. I was impressed with their professional way and quality of work. Our whole family is the Patient of AFD. Their estimates were closer to the actual billing. Recently I have the unpleasant experience. They estimated $50 Co-payment for the service. I willingly agreed. They charged $50 up front. No problem. It's Ok. Then they sent me another bill of $133. I was going to contact them the reason of so high difference between the estimates and actual bill, they sent me a threating letter for the collection. I have no choice to pay whatever they want. I believe Dr. Mark A Booher has lost his control and others are doing as Romans do. If we call our Insurance they say that they are charging as per the codes of the Dentist. When we call the Dentist they complain that this is what the Insurance charged and they have no control over the Insurance.  Very frustrating.",US

ANYTHING HAPPENS LAZ-Y-BOY REPLACES the ITEM - TURNS OUT THAT'S A LIE!  My wife and I purchased 3 products worth over $4,000.00 in January 2015 and additional items throughout the following years from your Victoria, British Columbia, Canada outlet. During that particular purchase, the sales person convinced us to purchase comprehensive insurance for an additional $200. When the salesperson approached us with the information concerning additional fees and coverage, I specifically asked the salesperson to clarify exactly what was covered should something happen that LA Z BOY was not able to clean, repair or replace a piece of our furniture due to one of the approved conditions. The response was, “LA Z BOY will replace your piece of furniture at the full purchase price”. I had no reason to disbelieve the salesperson.   The sofa we purchased was stained accidentally last month, my wife immediately contacted the LA Z BOY outlet. The Victoria LA Z BOY outlet sent a cleaning contractor to our home where he attempted to clean the sofa cushions. Much to our dismay, the cleaning technician informed us due to the type of material our sofa was made of, the stains could not be removed. The technician specifically informed us, that type of material was virtually impossible to remove stains from. I immediately questioned LA Z BOY’s motives for selling us a policy if they knew the material couldn’t be cleaned??? My wife was devastated. She made sure the sofa was in immaculate condition since the purchase. LA Z BOY service department contacted us to inform us LA Z BOY did not have any fabric or replacement cushions for our sofa. Yet again we were disappointed in what we were told at the time of purchase only to discover now, was not true. We relied on the word of the salesperson.  LA Z BOY service person contacted us yet again to inform us, unfortunately, the small print in the insurance policy prorates the price of the item 15% per year. The original $1,948.99 (not including sales tax) was now worth $779.60. He went on to inform us we could apply that amount to a new sofa. Needless to say, my wife and I found it disappointing that what we were told turned into nothing more than a way to extract more money from us at the time of purchase. Now all we end up with is a fraction of the price we paid for the furniture.  My wife and I went into the LA Z BOY outlet only to discover exactly what we feared, the price of a new sofa was out of reach for us, even with the meager $779.60 we could apply to a new sofa. Not only were the funds we were allowed to apply to a new sofa not sufficient to cover a third of the cost of a new sofa, my wife didn’t see one style she liked.  It’s very frustrating knowing we kept that sofa in “like new” condition only to find out the insurance policy we purchased in good faith had hidden small print providing insufficient funds to enable us to purchase a new sofa. We can’t afford to spend MORE money on ANOTHER new sofa. We saved enough to allow my wife to pick out the exact pieces of furniture she always wanted, and from LA Z BOY whom she loved because you stand behind your furniture.  We know we’ll never get a new sofa from LA Z BOY based on the small print which yet again written to mislead and screw over a client purchasing the furniture in good faith based on LAZ Y BOY's sales person's guarantees.  We approached the store manager with ONE simple request. Since the cost of a new sofa was out-of-reach for us, and there were not any in stock my wife liked anyway, the ONLY request we made, was to be able to apply the $779.60 as in in-store credit towards another smaller item (such as a coffee table) instead of ONLY being able to apply it towards a new sofa. We were yet again told LAZ Y BOY would not do that either. We have 60 days to buy something else or we loss that as well!  Thanks LAZ Y BOY, for NOTHING!",CA

When I arrived, he told me he was terribly sorry for the inconvenience and he reassured me that he would take care of the problem at no charge and would deliver the car to my home when it was repaired in addition, he noticed the front brake pads worn and he replaced those as well.

I paid the initial amount on both properties and applied for the Pulte Mortgage. I asked before this whole process started if I could transfer the money, I paid from one property to anther if I was not approved by the Pulte Mortgage for both properties. I know things can change during the pandemic and even my situation is not guaranteed to remain the same. So, I asked that question to both sales reps just in case something happened from now until closing date in 8-12 months. I was told that if at closing time I was approved for 1 property, I will be able to transfer the money to the property I was approved for. I was also told that the whole buying process is smooth since it is all within the Pulte companies. First Mislead; At the time of closing, I was denied for one of the properties and approved for the other. I requested my money to be transferred to the one I was approved for. I was told the builder will keep 50% of the money and that they are simply following the contract. I have been trying to reach the supervisor of those 2 sales reps but no luck for me reaching anyone. I asked Britany to have any of the decision-making people call me (the customer) and she said that her supervisor will call me. I called her again and she said, “I am the rep of the builder and you can talk to me and no one else will talk to me”. The sales reps are either not knowledgeable or they give the customer any answer to get them to buy. They will blame you that you signed a paper for it. So, my advice to you, do not trust what you hear from the Pulte sales reps and make sure to read the contracts or get a lawyer to read every single paper before signing. they cannot be trusted even if you ask specific questions, you will not get the full truth.  Also, The Pulte Homes called me a month before the property was completed and scheduled a final walk through and 3 days after for the closing. For a whole month the Pulte Mortgage have been asking me for documents and income and I submitted everything they asked for. After I signed for those dates I was told if there is a delay in closing, I will pay $250 for every day. The closing day came and passed and now they want me to pay for the delay on top of what I have lost before already. I was told by the Mortgage company that the delay is from the underwriting. So now I am getting different people from different departments (all under the Pulte umbrella) who do not communicate with each other at all, put the blame on each other and the result is the customer is being penalized for all their mistakes. There is no communication between the different department in Pulte, so it is not a smooth buying process as they claim. All of the different companies are Pulte and still no communication or coordination between them. They will find something to blame you the customer and make you pay penalties. I called the Pulte customer service to complain and was unable to reach a live person. I left a voice message, and no one cared to call back. If they treat their customers before you have a property with them, you can imagine what it will be when you try to reach them to fix something or for the home warranty. Please avoid doing business with this company or if you do, make sure to read everything in the contract before paying any money. I was a fool and paid first before receiving the contract.",US

Due to this failure of your establishment, Legal Recovery Action will be initiated against your establishment at 10:00am on Monday, 1st March 2021 with all associated fees, charges and recovery action costs to be added to the amount(s) due. Your staff advised on the 17th February 2021 that providing a Credit Card was the fastest method to receive our bond to be returned.  Your staff advised on the 25th February 2021 that our bond would automatically become visible in our account on the eighth (8th) day after being taken from us.  Neither of the above statements as provided and relied upon by me, have been truthful as both statements are now false statements given the date and evidence as it stands today.  When a resort is dealing with families, it holds a position of trust with that family and failing in its statements towards the family is both avoidable and irresponsible.  I sincerely hope that you rectify this matter as an urgent priority before 10:00am on 1st March 2021 In addition to the above, as per other reviews, your rooms and buildings are stuffy, our aircon did not cool the rooms and at no point in time until after the resort had taken 100% of our accommodation fees, did anyone speak up about an additional $200 bond which we were then harassed regarding daily which ultimately ruined my stay.  As a resort, you again have a Duty of Care to extend to your guests and families in dealing with a person/s or family's budget and withholding information and money which has now been in the hands of Turtle Beach for more time in duration than our entire stay is appalling conduct indeed.  I witnessed another family in the carpark who obviously was hit up for an extra $200 without warning and the disappointment was clearly visible.   As a Local to both the Gold Coast and Brisbane, I really do hope that you are not treating others as dishonestly and appallingly as my family has been treated.  The Gold Coast has a reputation for being 'sharky' and in my own experience, Turtle Beach Resort is not helping the image of tourism on the Gold Coast via these substandard actions and behaviours.

Once again, he requested another week to determine how ATT would refund me over a year of funds that paid to ATT due to a former store manager in THEIR employee that cheated myself and others. At this point I will NEVER recommend ATT to anyone as this seems to be the treatment a 20 plus year customer receives. As a front line first responder I could not in good conscious recommend ATT to any of my colleagues.

That part will upset any parent.  My daughter has a townhouse here. It's one of the most expensive places in town. You DON'T get what you pay for though! They show you a very nice model ,say all the right things. Then it's move in day. My daughter's townhouse, shared w/ 3 friends , all 19-20 & one 23 yr old 5th yr student that already lived there. They match you up if you don't have 4. That's not the problem here.   The problem is the place was trashed upon move in. All the blinds were broken, bent, wouldn't operate properly, etc. The carpet had large black stains everywhere & was well worn at best in the main level family room, the stairs going down to the ground level, & the floor on that level had stains too & look nasty. It smelled down there of mildew & the carpet colors were 2 different colors stairs to floor. Obviously some patchwork replacement had been done. I estimate the carpets in question were probably at least 5 years old. Problem was, I was not there. My daughter wanted to drive herself there & had her things, so I agreed reluctantly.  The kids noted the blinds & other issues & eventually , Copper got around to fixing & replacing them, but it wasn't prompt or easy. The carpet was another matter. I was out there in Feb & saw it. I noticed immediately. Gross & uncalled for, I would not let a dog sleep on it. My daughter told me there was no place on the inspection form, which the tenants didn't get a copy of, to note the shabby, worn out, multi stained carpeting & frankly, they thought it was just ""how it was in College"". They were naive, not experienced, typical teens. Copper took advantage of this.   Now for the part that will enrage any parent!! I called the office on a Friday after seeing this. Got a guy answering phones, said what I had seen, he put me on hold & about 5 min later told me the Manager said we could get the carpet cleaned & he had a source, we would be paying for it though. I told him cleaning was fruitless, that carpet was old, almost destroyed IMHO, & needed replacing. I asked to speak to his Manager, he then tells me ""she just left for the day"". THAT didn't impress me, told me someone is dodging their job. I told him to have her/him call me on Monday, he said he would. Well, Monday comes, no call....so I call around 3. The Manager answers this time. I explained what I saw & I get at best...obstinate indifference. A better description of her attitude from the get go would be rude, defiant, indignant, insulting, & accusatory. I felt like I was dealing with an inner city slum Lord! I get quoted ""they are adults, they signed off on the move in inspection, they are responsible for the carpet, if there are stains or damage , that will be ""dealt with"" when they move out."" I said ""you took advantage of naive teens, barely ""adults"", & you really think that carpet is acceptable?"" I said I know you will say they did this, keep their deposit , & not fix a thing while they are there."" She refused to accept the fact that it was in nasty, poor, damaged condition at move in....& basically tried to tell me they did it, if it's in the condition I stated! I reiterated that it would be impossible for them to do that much staining & damage over a few months! The wear & tear alone gives it away that this is old carpet! I asked when was it last replaced? No answer. I said there is probably mold that can make them sick under it, she didn't care. She actually scoffed at that issue. She refused to accept any of this. She also refused 5 times to go just look at it herself, but finally on my insistence, agreed to ""send a maintenance guy"" to look at it someone this week. I asked , ""how can 3, 19-20 yr old girls who don't have parties, don't even drink, primarily stay in their bedrooms & keep to themselves & only go out for groceries or class & have only been in the place about 3 months (they were all gone from Nov 18 until about Jan 15th) do that much damage & wear & tear?"" She didn't care & stuck to her premise that they did the staining, the wear & tear. She kept going back to the move in inspection. I told her, she took advantage of naive kids, they didn't know better & were probably just excited to be back at School after all the Covid turmoil. She didn't care, just got defiant & basically told me , tough, your problem. DON'T let you kid move into this place. I have done some research. Housing sources at JMU tell me this place has a rep for this & for poor maintenance work or replies. They don't care, they do as little as they must. Other townhouses apparently have nasty, old damaged , low grade builder carpet in them too at this development. RENTER BEWARE!",US

He is  an  excellent attorney and if you have the opportunity to have him as your lawyer you are very fortunate.  He understands the psychology behind negotiations while  managing expectations and emotions not only when dealing with his clients, but mediators, judges and juries.  You should be aware that before Jeremy joined the Dolan Law Firm as a Plaintiffs attorney he used to represent insurance companies as the Defendants attorney.   He knows the playbook of the insurance companies which is a huge advantage to the Plaintiff. On March 1, 2017 I was sitting in my car at a yield sign  in Palo Alto when a person slammed into me.  At the time, I was a top producing real estate agent in Silicon Valley  and thanks to Jeremy Jessup at the  Dolan Law Firm I still Am. The accident  literally changed my life for the next couple of years. Jeremy methodically and strategically guided me through the medical and legal process, communicating with my doctors, medical specialist, healthcare workers, massage therapist, acupuncturist, and physical therapist.  He put in a claim with Geico who initially made a lowball offer to settle the case.  Jeremy rejected their offer and before we actually walked into a court room negotiated a settlement far beyond anything I actually expected! After reviewing and acknowledging the settlement agreement I was compensated within two weeks. This process took approximately 3.5 years from the date of the accident and was well worth the wait as I was receiving medical treatment.

I was being seen for High Blood Pressure and Tachycardia. I was seen by a Cardiologist, who requested admission to Telemetry, a Medication Stress Test, ECHO, EKG, and necessary blood work. I was placed on a monitor and NPO. During my stay in the ED I was never offered a blanket, or had the alarm on the monitor given a response after over twenty alarms. I detached the alarm, myself, at least six times in order to use the restroom. I walked past the nurses station with no attention given by any staff. I would reattach the leads, myself.  The tests were completed and I was taken back to the ED. Within twenty minutes, the primary Rn came in and stated ""you can go home, now."" No paperwork or any information as to the test results or discharge instructions. I had reattached the monitor. There was no change in my symptoms. I had not been given anything for the symptoms. I did have a headache from the Medicated Stress Test, which I informed my nurse of and was not even offered a Tylenol. I had not eaten anything in over twenty four hours and was not offered even a cracker or a juice. I asked for the Cardiologist, who did not return. I was told that I should ""call your doctor in a few days and make an appointment with Dr. Shaw in two or three weeks."" Please Note: I was still ""Tachy"" and Hypertensive. The primary Rn, then, said ""I will go read the doctors notes!!"" After approximately one hour another woman entered the room, again, stating ""you can go home, now."" This woman identified herself as ""the Nurse Practitioner."" A new primary Rn was present and inquired as to who she was. She identified herself as ""Dudek"" (sp?)   This woman was not able to answer any questions or provide the blood work tests results, ie; TSH level as I had my thyroid removed and am being treated for  hypothyroidism, as well.  Her response was: ""I don't know if they did that test.""  ""I will add it, if they didn't and I will let you know."" She never returned. I did manage to get her to order my anti-hypertensives and allow me to remain in the ED for four more hours so that I COULD monitor my pressure! I left the ED with a headache, weak from hunger and without any real treatment. No one escorted me out or asked of my transportation source to ""go home."" The staff in the ED was not less than compassionate. I work in an ED. I know about the ""COVID environment"" I was told that multiple times, along with ""you are being discharged"" and ""you can go home, now."" This did not ring with any sincerity, rather, them not wanting to monitor a patient in need.  I have never felt so unwelcome in my life! I would think that a patient who is being considered a ""Cardiac"" would be monitored for weakness, dizziness, etc. I was allowed to detach my leads with alarms blaring, walk to the halls unattended, unmonitored.

First and foremost, I renewed this year because I really respect my local Farmers agent. However, my house was hit with the Memorial Day tornado in Sapulpa, OK. It was awful. Not only inside my home, but outside as well. So the first adjuster comes a week after the tornado and does all her estimates which show depreciation, but once the work is completed, Farmers will reimburse you the ""full replacement"" costs. Not so... The claim was redone in September, 2019, with some extra square footage. I didn't want to install carpeting in the winter so I wanted until the first week of March to start getting estimates. No one would come inside my house because of the pandemic. And the pandemic hit fast... out of five requests, only 3 returned my call, and only two of those showed up... and only one sent an estimate. Yay! So I decided to go to the big box stores. Once I started looking at pricing, I thought I would save money and get laminate - not vinyl - laminate - which was cheaper. They took my order the first week of June and told me it might take a little longer to get the product because the pandemic had slowed down transportation. The flooring came in and the installers came the end of July. They were short trim boards so they had to be backordered. That came in September and had to be installed. I submitted the itemized claim to Farmers. The adjuster called and first told me my claim time had expired and I explained to her the pandemic has slowed down everything. She then informed me that laminate was an UPGRADE from carpeting. Please - never tell at 64-year-old widow woman that plastic flooring is an UPGRADE from carpeting. Good grief! Do they think we really believe that? So they reimbursed me about one-third (1/3)  of my cost and I'm the one who chose to go with a cheaper product. So much for FULL REPLACEMENT COST.  I did think about not renewing, but like I said, I have a great agent so I renewed for another year, BUT... I will tell everyone about this experience and how they really screwed this old woman. It truly was bad faith... She also informed me that she would have to check with her superiors to see how much they would reimburse me. In less than ten minutes, she called back with stating they would pay me around $1800 for the FULL REPLACEMENT COST - it was much higher than that. I want my friends, family, and those single ladies out there on their own to be careful... They also had to replace my roof and it turned out to be a better warranty... so wasn't that an upgrade? But the adjuster for the roofing paid the entire claim except for the deductible. Of course that was a different adjuster. Beware ladies... especially if you're widowed, living alone, and on social security. Oh... and last, but not least, she also told me I would not be able to claim any other repairs from the tornado because my year was up. So no consideration for the pandemic and trying to get workers to come into your house - a lot of whom are very behind because of the pandemic.",US

We recently lost our ranch to the Glass Fire in September. The only structure that did not burn was our horse's barn that we purchased through SC Barns in 2015. In dire need of a new hay barn we again reached out to SC Barns. We were told by Ryan, and I quote "" I have plenty of projects. I don't need to do your project, and I don't want to do your project. I will not change my mind. "" Sadly, we can't bring our horses home until we have a hay barn. As a result, this news was devastating not only to us, but to all in our community who have donated to our Go Fund Me to help finance this project, and also to those who depend on our services. The lack of humanity in Ryan's response to our nonprofit's needs in our moment of great need is appalling. Ryan you may be successful in business but your inability to be responsive to the needs of our community, when it doesn't meet your needs is exactly what our community doesn't need.

My belief is that all of these things are of low quality, made in China, and these companies are 'fly-by-night' here one day and gone the next or under a new name. I also have learned that when one person takes the time out of their busy day to complain that there are likely hundreds or thousands of other customers that have had the very same experience and just figured it was not worth the effort. That being said... I have tried to reach out to New GreenAir Diffusers Located in Ohio, I believe. Their website helps to obfuscate information. Customer service 800-548-0040 line is always ""busy"" so one is directed to leave a message, but you are assured of a return call in twenty-four hours.  That has not happened for me. I have called several times over several days and the only way I was able to actually hear from this company was via email. customerservice at newgreenair.com Where I was met with a replay from Mark Castro. I explained that the device lights up but no longer ""diffuses."" The fan does not turn on and the ultrasonic transducer is no longer creating vapor. And, that it seemed to be an electrical fault on the circuit. I continued that I was able to verify the USB adapter and plug was working - so power was being supplied at the proper voltage.  Mark advised me to clean the inside of the device. I immediately responded that I had already done so and was already through any user trouble shooting and that the device was still not working. That, I wanted to take advantage of the one-year warranty, as this device was purchased last year in January or early February at a home show I attended. No response. I guess they will stall for the next month or so and then advise that I am out of the warranty period. I cannot recommend this company based on my recent experiences and interactions with their customer service. While this device is not the be-all, end-all item in my life, I feel that this is just one more company that takes advantage of their customers and does little more than to contribute to landfills in our country.",US

I've been trying to find solutions to this problem without doing a total ""remodel"" of the countertop.  I decided to Google someone outside the L.A. area to get another opinion and discovered the RSK Granite and Marble website.  I spoke to Peter, the owner, and explained the situation.  He gave me his opinion and I will be passing this on to my contractor.  I found Peter to be most friendly, professional and spent quite a bit of time on the phone with me.  I would recommend him to anyone doing a kitchen remodel despite the fact that I live in another state!  It is interesting to me that someone from outside my state could give me additional input as to what most likely is the underlying reason that the crack happened to begin with.  It's one thing to try to ""patch"" the crack but he emphasized the importance of understanding why the crack occurred in the first place.  I owe him a debt of gratitude for his kindness and patience.  I'm sure, looking at his website, that his kitchen remodels are beautiful.  I will be addressing this issue after the new year.

I would recommend Dr Nordean to everyone!!!   When you arrive at Tempe Dental Center, the patient is greeted by friendly staff members. The wait time is minimal, along with the office having a friendly atmosphere.  I started seeing Dr Nordean right after Covid-19 pandemic started. As a health care provider I was able to see first hand how diligent Dr Nordean and his office staff followed the safety recommendations of CDC.  During the 9 months of dental work done. Dr Nordean always had a smile on his face, explained each procedure, and made me feel at ease. Each procedure was done without pain or distress. Proper medications were prescribed as needed. Additionally Dr Nordean was not in a hurry. Always greeted you with a smile and always said goodbye with a smile. Dr Nordean has a wonderful staff; each greeted you by name, had a concern about your well being and very friendly. Similarly, the front office never let you leave without making an upcoming appointment. If you are looking for a dentist, I would highly recommend Dr Nordean Tempe Dental Center office ( also known as Dr J Dental). As a patient you are treated with respect and dignity by everyone, you will feel right at home knowing you are getting the best care in the Valley. Thank you Dr Nordean and everyone in the office for providing me with compassionate care.  I can smile again, my teeth look beautiful!!!",US

The lady taking our order asked my daughter Katie (who was 21 yesterday) for ID. Katie had no ID so we explained that today was indeed her 21st birthday and we had come out to celebrate. Katie had a 21st birthday badge on and had all her birthday jewellery on. The server then went to the manager to explain. The server came back to our table and refused to serve the wine as Katie had no I.D. We explained that we could show Katies Facebook page which has lots of congratulatory messages for her 21st birthday but still she was refused. This completely ruined our evening and as such we will be eating out again on Saturday night up to make up for this ridiculous episode. We are bitterly disappointed with the lack of common sense shown. Reply given by Bears Head Deputy Manager: Thank you for taking the time to reach out to us regarding your visit. We are sorry that you left unsatisfied. Unfortunately, as your daughter had no valid form of ID available upon request, we were unable to serve her an alcoholic drink. A 21st Birthday badge and Facebook account are not an acceptable form of ID and therefore the waitress that served you was following the correct policy. In reference to the ‘government website states a 16 or 17 year old is allowed to have a glass of wine with their meal if they are with an adult’, this is correct, however our company policy is that we do not serve anyone under the age of 18 alcohol, furthermore that we continue to follow the challenge 21 policy. The reason for this is ‘the protection of children from harm’ which is an objective set out in the licensing laws. I appreciate this was extremely frustrating for you and your party however had your daughter had a valid form of Id available, we would have been happy to serve her. Thank you again for your custom and I hope that you and your family stay safe in these unprecedented times. Basically the management were calling the 3 adults in our party liars. We have never ever been so appalled by the attitude of any eating establishment and would certainly not recommend The Bears Head to anybody.",GB

Juli was able to convince the renter to stage the home and eventually let people into the house. The renters left a mess in and outside the home, and Juli  hired someone to haul everything away.

I've spent the past 5-6 years paying for Youtube Red/Premium because it also came with Google Play Music.  Now Google is shutting it down so their stupid Youtube Music app that no one wants and has worse functionality can take over the Google Play Music app, instead of just letting us use the same app we've been using for many years. If I had unlimited data I would stop paying for Youtube Premium since the only feature I want is downloaded videos and background play, two features that should be in Youtube but they make you pay for. That, plus the ability to use Google Play Music is the only reason I subscribe for only $10 a month and still do, but man do I really really hate Google the older we both get.  I've been watching and using Youtube since the year of it's inception so it's like a part of me, but Google turned it into something corporate where now you can still have ads on your videos but not get paid for them, if you even can get ads at all.  Then they actually delete/ban creators like Belle Delphine on a platform where you used to be able to do ANYTHING you wanted, because it was called YOUtube!  Now it's Googletube, Youtube has been dead for years. They just became a worse company over time that cancels their projects because they can, even though they make BILLIONS of dollars each year, so it's literally nothing to them.

They are ""out"" of the paint and they argued that they didn't have it and it would not be in until November 30th (you know....fire brick paint....from the place that sells fire places).

A half hour later I had no brochures. I should have known I was in trouble when I called them, they were listed as being open, and nobody answered. So I walked over there and there was one employee working whose badge said Assistant Manager, but no customers. I told her that I called and nobody answered, and I just got a blank look. So I tried to send her the link the brochure, but she kept saying she didn't get it, but offered to have me log onto to one of their computers (for pay) and send it from their computer in store, presumably to another of their computers in the store.  Couldn't they just look up the link? I didn't understand the point of that, but I did it. I just wanted my brochures. I then still could not make it work, so I went back home and emailed the link from there. When I returned to the store they had gotten the link, and this time the manager was there and told me they cannot print from a link, and I needed to download the brochure onto a flash drive for them to print it. They must be the only people on the planet who cannot print from a link - my grandma can do that. So I called the UPS store who said, ""Of course we can print from a link."" Within minutes they had 100 brochures printed for me and folded and the manager emailed me to let me know they were finished. When I got to my presentation I was telling my story, and one of the people there said, ""Was it by chance the FedEx store on Sonterra Blvd? Because that is the WORST store in the world!""

2576,www.google.com,2020-10-18T20:21:53.000Z,1,My issues are with the service…,"My issues are with the service department at Honda Serramonte. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had which has led me to write my first negative ratings and reviews.  I came to a scheduled meeting at Honda Serramonte to discuss a “misunderstanding” and mishandling of services given to my 97 year old Grandmother with a service advisor named Radley Abarrientos.  My Grandma a few days prior had went in for an oil change for her 1997 Honda that is worth $1500 and came out with a bill of $3000.  I had written a Google review 3 days prior explaining the details of my Grandma and her experience which Mr. Abarrientos had seen and I believe at the time led the company to want to resolve, so I was hopeful we could discuss this situation and get to the bottom of why my Grandmother’s bill was $3000.  I went into this meeting expecting civility but instead was met with callous and flippant behavior.  Mr. Abarrientos did not hide that he had no intention or interest in resolving the situation and became visibly impatient with me and threw all civility out the window.  Mr. Abarrientos brought up the Google review and outwardly called my experience a lie.  He mocked me when I tried to explain to him that it was his responsibility as the mechanic to be honest with his clients and let them know that any work that is more than the price of the actual car is probably not worth the work. I told him that I had gone through a similar experience years before where my mechanic told me just that, and it saved me money and I was grateful for his honesty and that he didn’t try to swindle money out of me.  Mr. Abarrientos response was “I am no Life Coach” and took no responsibility for persuading my Grandma of 97 years, who only wanted to make her car drivable for one more year, who knows nothing about cars, to pay $3000.  He also went as far as to question and accuse me for not having gone with my Grandma to her car appointment  which leads me to believe he knew he was cheating my Grandmother because no one was with her at the time and he thought he would get away with it.  Not that I owe an explanation but I’ll give one anyway. Firstly,  no one had any idea that she had an appt to get her car serviced. Being 97 my Grandma is extremely able, can drive, and is very sharp but she is also stubborn and English is her second language.  She did not make any of her family aware that she had a car appointment and, in fact, only brought up that she went to the mechanic in casual conversation. That is why we called first thing the next morning to cancel any work being done to her car.  Upon further questioning Mr. Abarrientos said, and I quote, “I am A, your grandmother is B, and you are C and have nothing to do with this situation.” To me, that statement was outrageous!  I have every right to question anything regarding my grandmother and a sketchy mechanic deal.  After our short 10-15 minute conversation that resolved nothing, Mr. Abarrientos didn’t even try to hide the dirty look and condescending head shake he gave me before going inside the building to return my grandmothers car. While this entire encounter with Mr. Abarrientos and I took place Bobbie Santos, Mr. Abarrientos manager, was sitting in his office only a few feet away with his door open.  Prior to this meeting my husband and myself spoke with Bobbie Santos about our concerns, receiving only apathetic and impatient responses from him, but for some reason Mr. Santos did not even bother coming out to speak with me during my entire encounter with Mr. Abarrientos. I could see him, just sitting in his office, and I know he saw me. I know he heard Mr. Abarrientos and my heated encounter and had absolutely no interest in dealing with the situation even though he was very much involved.  In conclusion to our meeting Mr. Abarrientos took $600 off of my Grandmothers $3000 bill which left her to pay $2300, the labor fee itself was $1600 which is incredibly unbelievable to me. After Mr. Abarrientos and my awful encounter was over I could see the two gentlemen speaking together while my grandmother paid her very expensive, now $2300 “oil change”. I did not go into Honda Serramonte expecting free work. I didn’t even go into the meeting with the intention of getting my grandmothers money back, which she wouldn’t have agreed to anyway because that is the kind of woman she is! I came in hopeful to resolve the problem and get answers and explanations. I will be getting quotes from other Honda’s about labor costs and service fees and I will be getting quotes from other mechanics on what they claimed to have done to her car.  I will continue to investigate this because I know deep down in my gut that this was a form of elder abuse.  They took advantage of my Grandmother, her age, and her language barrier, and for me, that is despicable.",US

The cost we thought was a little high, but we were assured of the quality of this roof.  They told us it was insulated and is the best roof they sell. Fast forward .... After months the roof was installed.  Indeed it was a very nice-looking roof.  But then - it rained.  It didn't leak, but the rain falling on the roof is so loud that you can't hear the TV and you certainly cannot carry on a conversation.  When it is ""stormy raining"", you can't even stay in the room it is so deafening and you can't even turn the TV up loud enough to play over it.  We also have a large Oak tree that is dropping acorns.  Those little tiny acorns sound like golf balls being slammed on the roof.  Once in awhile an acorn falls just so, that the sound is so loud that it will make you jump out of your skin!  We had an aluminum roof and have lived in another house with a screen porch and an aluminum roof.  We KNOW how rain and falling debris sound on an aluminum roof.  But this is 3-4 times louder than any aluminum roof we have ever been under -anywhere.  What did White Aluminum say about that?  ""We can't help it if your house is under an Oak tree.""  Unbelievable.  Totally missing the point. White Aluminum sent people out a couple of times - once a service man and this last time the salesperson who sold us this horrendous roof and an ""engineer"" that is SUPPOSED to know something.  They both insisted that there is nothing wrong with our roof and they have NEVER had any complaints and that they have this same roof on their houses and they are soooooooooooooooo quiet compared to pan aluminum roofs.  They just kept repeating this over and over like I was some kind of lying moron that was just making stuff up THEREFORE - either my roof is faulty (which they did nothing but look at it) or they are all a bunch of LIARS.  So, their ""final answer"" was Tuff S&%T.  We put on a roof - pay us our money. You are exaggerating - you are a liar. This roof is quiet - because we said so. So, here I am stuck with paying $10,000 for a disastrous roof that either I am going to have to live with for the next 20 years - I love my house - OR I am going to have to spend yet MORE MONEY$$$ to try to sound-proof the roof or ceiling.  So ...... beware of White Aluminum's ""Best Aluminum Roof"".  If you are never going to be inside where the roof is - or don't mind over paying for a totally inferior product - then go for it.  But if you intend on being inside and trying to do such abnormal things as watch TV or have a conversation with someone when it's raining, then DO NOT GET THIS ROOF!   If you want to use them for some other product(s) then have at it - but know this - they will NOT stand behind their work.",US

They are operating fraudulently and lied to me. I wonder why? Thankfully, Aquathin serviced my system professionally and has assured me that my system will last for many many years.",GB

2614,www.google.com,2020-10-06T00:21:14.000Z,1,"Toyota Dealership in Bowie, MD","I had an appointment with the Toyota dealership located in Bowie, MD on Sunday, October 4, 2020  between 1:00 and 1:30pm.  I made the appointment about two weeks ago, after receiving a phone call from the dealership asking me if I was still in the market to buy a new car, to which I responded yes to the young lady over the phone.  I told her my criteria up front and the price range I was looking for.  I understand that nothing is written in stone and that there are not guarantee’s in life, however, I was still hopeful.   Upon my arrival the place, I saw that the dealership was practically empty with little to no customers.   In my mind I pretty much chalked it up to the COVID-19 crisis. The sales associate  Mr. Jake Evans was polite.  On the business card that I received it stated the Toyota Dealership was Responsible, Reliable and Respectful.  The Respectful part is in question.  I currently have a Toyota Avalon and I am considering trading it in for a newer model.  After I spoke with Jake, and give him my list of do’s and don’ts (which in my opinion, he should have already seen in the computer when I gave the lady the criteria I was looking over the phone when I made my appointment).  We both went out and looked at the Toyota Avalons.  After reviewing what was on the dealership lot Jake came back and worked up a quote.  When we could not come to a meeting of the minds in terms of price.  Jake went over and spoke to the sales manager on duty.  After a less than one minute conversation, Jake came back and stated that the price would remain the same and not be negotiated.  Ok then… so be it.  I was never asked about financing or whether or not I would be potentially financing with Toyota and or another party.  Jake never inquired if I planned on putting any money down.  Nor was I informed of the Toyota incentives. Less than five minutes later.  Jake went a second time to speak with the sales manager to see if he wanted to come over and personally talk to me, about the Avalon…the sales manager did not even acknowledge my presence in the empty showroom.  He did not even bother to get his behind out of the chair, as though I was not worth his time especially when this dealership is the one that called me.  In my opinion that was equivalent to giving me the middle finger. In my mind, I took the time to make an appointment on a Sunday to be insulted.  At the Toyota dealerships located in Bethesda and Gaithersburg, MD the Sales managers came down from their ivory tower (table and or office) to at least acknowledge my presence, say a few words, offer me their business card in addition to  treating me as a “RESPECTFUL” potential and or future buyer.  Not the Toyota dealership lo in Bowie, MD.   Now I understand why the Toyota Dealership in Bowie, MD is empty and not necessarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",US

He also took the time to tell us about himself and his background.  Usually Drs are in such a hurry that they are in and out and even if you had a question for them, it's too late because they are gone.  Dr Storey took great care of my mom, explained everything very thoroughly and answered questions before he did anything.

I thought, WOW this is going to be a wonderful experience doing business with them.  But I spoke too soon as once the owner bucked her dreadful head it was all over. Her name is Julie and when I tell you that this woman doesn't smile, greet or shows any humility (and that is only to name a few) it would blow your mind.  The first guy she sent out to my house measured incorrectly and for that, I had to hear numerous excuses as to why my cost increased by hundreds of dollars.  Not because of his mistake but now, it's because of mine.  Go figure!  For 2 months I almost dreaded going into that office to bring in certain documents, homeowner insurance, deeds, etc. to seal the deal because I just did not want to see her!! Finally, when I informed her that I would like a credit for the removal and hauling of the chain link fence that my Tree Trimming people were going to remove, that's really when all hell broke loose!  She argued that they would also have to do this and do that.... and why did I wait so long to get tree trimmers to do the job?  I reminded her that you never gave me a designated date until today on my fence installment and that I still have more than a week to get the foilage down.  She ended with, you can have your money back and that's what I'm going to do, give you your money back!  I guess I can consider myself pretty fortunate that this job totally ""fell through"".  Who wants to do business with a company who speaks to you in this manner and argues with you on valid questions and issues? NOT ME!

It is all delightful, and even if you're not obsessed with plants and gardening (like me)  it's just a fantastic and peaceful place to be.

Took 2008 Toyota Camry Hybred in for regular service.  Of course, car needed alignment and then tires.  Recommended new battery too!  Bill was over $1000 and when I left the low tire light started blinking.  I called and they said they would reset it and come back by.  When I came back by no one was there to reset it. Dec 2019 - brought car in to get the new battery and ask them to reset the low tire light.  $ 400+ bill and when I left the low tire light was blinking. I parked the car and it was driven very little. Covid-19 hit Sept 2020 Brought car in for regular service.  Car had only been driven 343 miles since Dec 2019.   I asked them for a state inspection and to reset the blinking low tire light that started blinking after they put new tires on in Sept 2019.  The car had been driven around total 700 miles since the new tires were installed.   They performed the inspection and replaced two license plate bulbs for $32 and wanted $1000+ to replace all four valve stems because I no longer had the correct valve stems for monitoring tire pressure.  They are the only people that worked on the car and changed the tires but they don’t know why the valve stems are wrong or why it was working before they changed the tires and not working after.  They had to of changed out the valve stems and not told me when they put the new tires on in Sept.  They created a repair trap by changing the stems when they installed the new tires.  I have pictures showing the car with the correct stems before I took it to them.  I talked to the service rep (JJ Saenz) and the Service Manager who claimed they would not replace the stems unless I paid for it.   I told him they were crooks and I would never be back again.  They always try to find something extra to charge you for and especially pray on innocent women.  I have seen it every time I have been there.  I found the correct valve stems at 4 for $87 total and a garage that will install them for $15 per tire.  Total $147 not $1000+.  Total crooks!

At 10h20, the tea break over and the technicians continued with the service for another 10 m,  so it took all of 20 minutes, at a cost of $426  for the very ""LONG"" service and I was made to wait 3 hours, and then it was suggested seeing as I had waited so long [not my fault] that I should seriously consider forgoing having my car washed.  I immediately regretted having insisted on the full service with all its jingle and bells, for which I had paid because the boot had not been cleaned , the car was dripping wet [ sun would dry it, I was told] the dash board had not even seen a cloth but I guess the driver area was clean and that is all that really matters.

2679,www.google.com,2020-09-14T23:04:52.000Z,1,What's wrong with Google?!!,"I used to love Google and swear by them. But not anymore. I have learned too much about the problems with using Google services.  My Robinhood account was hacked. I received an email notice that I had logged in to Robinhood. I had not! Luckily, I had taken the money out. The hackers got nothing. But my credit union account was also hacked. They took out thousands of dollars. They did this by using my email username and password to verify that ""I"" was authorizing an ACH transfer to their account. Then, they deleted the email. I had to go into my deleted emails and restore the ones that they had used to determine that had actually happened. I did verify that this occurred. So, they hacked at least three of my accounts. Luckily, I constantly work against hackers and scammers. I knew how to handle it. So, I did get my money back. But what if this was all of the money that I had in the world and I needed it to live on? What if I did not know how to handle fraudulent situations? Did Google care at all? No. As long as they are making money, they are happy. Watch ""The Social Dilemma"" on Netflix.  So, let me explain a few things. Google will try to refute my claims. Before they do, I want to tell you how secure my laptop is. Then I will tell you how they hacked my usernames and passwords. I have a boot partition security program to protect my boot from viruses that hackers might want to deploy. I have a ransomware protection program. I also have the usual firewall and Windows Defender. Then, I have a web defender from a reputable virus protection company as well as unhackme which I run once a day. I have a keystroke logger protection program and a few others. My wiFi is secured and I change my username and password frequently. I even disconnect from the internet when I'm not using it and turn my computer off when I am doing something else. What I am trying to say is that they could not have gotten my usernames and passwords from my laptop. They had to have come from somewhere else. That somewhere else is at Google passwords online, passwords dot google dot com. You may not know it but Google offers a free service where they keep a backup copy of your usernames and passwords when you save them in Google Chrome. That way, if you ever lose them, you can go to passwords dot google dot com to find them.  The problem is that, obviously, this can be hacked. Mine were. So, I suggest removing all of your passwords from passwords dot google dot com and from Google Chrome Browser then change all of your passwords. Never ever save them in Google Chrome. I even recommend not using the Google Chrome Browser at all. Use Avast Browser or AVG Browser. They are free and genuinely secure. Choose DuckDuckGo as your search engine. It does give you excellent search results. Do not, under any circumstances, use Epic Browser. They claim to be secure but their search results are almost all ads. If Epic is only out for the advertising dollar, they are probably not as secure as they claim. I don't know, yet, about MS Edge and Bing. Honestly, I haven't researched them yet. I will then I will write a review about them. Now, let's move on to Google Maps. I was using Google Maps on my phone as my GPS. I didn't like my actual GPS because it took me to a wrong place ONCE. So, I thought that Google would have the latest and greatest GPS system. Oh was I wrong. First of all, I travel a lot. I go to cities that I don't know. So, I depend on a GPS to get me from point A to point Z. Sometimes I pull in somewhere for a cup of coffee or to fill up my tank. I've noticed on cloudy days that when I'm leaving wherever, Google Maps will say ""go south on Main Street"" or something similar. The problem is that on a cloudy day, I don't know which way is south when I am in unfamiliar territory. So, I just turn right or left. Then, if I am going in the wrong direction, Google will tell me ""make a u-turn"". The problem with this is that I might be in heavy traffic. I can't just make a u-turn. I have to find a place where I can turn around. Then, on a few of my trips, Google Maps would take me the long way around. I could get into details to explain this but let me just say that it would take me around a beltway when I could simply go down a city street with a much shorter distance. It also took me many miles south when I was trying to go north. It wanted me to take the four lane highway instead of the shortest route. I even tried to change my destination to a place that was due north. It still took me east for a long distance before giving me a route to the north. I went many, many miles out of my way.  Suffice it to say, that, as a long time Google user, even understanding that Google is the top search engine, I will never use Google anything again. I advise you to not use Google either.",US

I drove home and once I tried my smoothie it was horrible. I called the store in Greenbelt and a young lady answered the phone, I didn't get her name. I told her how bad the smoothie was, she tells me they don't always come out right. I then told her I have had the smoothie made at the Laurel and Columbia store and every time they come out right and tasty, my smoothie from Greenbelt was icey and didn't have the consistency of a smoothie. I asked next time I come there can I get another smoothie. She said protocol was if it has been more than 30 minutes and management was not there, then she can't make me another smoothie and said it in a very nasty tone. I then told her I will bring my smoothie back tomorrow and I will get a refund since you are so rude. She then calmed down and said it more politely she couldn't make me another but give me a refund I wasn't asking for a refund I just wanted my smoothie made right. I told her I will be back for a refund with my receipt and the bad watery smoothie. It has to be something they are doing wrong because whenever I go to the Laurel and Columbia store the smoothie is good. Maybe they should get some pointers from them.",US

In my Annapolis community, many of the 1500 homes have treed lots like mine and there is always business for landscapers/tree services.

I had been toying with the idea of a new vehicle when my 2007 Jeep Liberty gave up the ghost.  I wanted to keep her up and running for at least another year, but she just couldn't do it. I started looking around for a Subaru forester - as I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that's what I wanted.  Lo and behold, I found my new vehicle on-line!  My new Subaru is a 2020 Certified Pre-Owned model with only 3,200 miles on her!  I pounced on the deal, went into the dealership last night (Thursday, 8/27), test drove her and sealed the deal! I cannot say enough good things about Lester Glenn Subaru!  Andrew, the salesperson I was dealing with was awesome!  We clicked right away, which I feel is so important when you're going to be parting with a significant amount of money.  Am I right?  You bet I am! We did some negotiating back and forth and finally came to an accord.  Then I dealt Ron and Brian to sign all of my paperwork.  This deal couldn't have gone any smoother!   Not ONCE did I EVER feel pressured.  Andrew took his time, was patient through all of my questions and made the buying experience that much more pleasant! If any of their commercials, which I agree are pretty corny, turn you off, don't let them!  They've done their job as I remembered the name of Lester Glenn! The entire buying experience was quite painless - even writing the down payment check, if you can believe that one!!  So, if you're thinking of purchasing a Subaru, run, don't walk to Lester Glenn!  They now have a customer for life as long as I live here in New Jersey!! :-D  If you have ANY doubts about dealing with them, don't.",US

I recently went to buy a vehicle (F150) from them last week & it was the WORST experience i had trying to purchase a vehicle. First off, i called & inquired if the vehicle i saw was there on Saturday Morning, the person answering the phone replied that it was & asked if i would like to make an appointment to see & test drive the vehicle,  to which i replied yes. She then asked what time would work for me, to which i replied anytime after 12:30 that day, to which she replied ok, but if you can't make it we're also open on Sunday also. I said ok. I couldn't get in that day so i went first thing on Sunday and i got there around 9:30-9:45. Now, just so you know, i live in Lanham Maryland and this Dealership is in Woodbridge Virginia which is about an hour and thirty or forty five minutes from where i live. On arrival someone saw me and i identified who i was and showed them the email that was sent to me with the inquired Truck i wanted. i sat for about 30-45 minutes before the girl i spoke with came to see me. She, along with the salesperson kept looking for the keys to this truck for another 20-25 minutes. Now if you told me to come in on Saturday afternoon and i got there Literally when you open on Sunday, the keys are supposed to be there, but she came back with ""another manager knows the whereabouts of the keys"" & if you can wait till Eleven he would be in, or, i can leave & when he comes in she'll call me, to which i replied, can i at least see the truck because i live in Maryland, almost 2hrs away & whenever i leave here I'm going home. She then said let me call him & see how far he is. She comes back with i'm sorry but the truck's at Ford for some maintenance work. Pissed off because she initially said it was there when i called & did a wasted drive to VA. Still, i said ok.  To which she replied are you sure you didn't see another one on the lot? Cause we have so many out there, to which i replied, ma'am, i specifically researched all your trucks which is why i inquired about THAT specific Truck, to which she said yeah, with the luxury options & retractable running board & other stuff thats on it huh, i said EXACTLY. So I'm Leaving, ANNOYED, & i said to her i'll be working right up the block from y'all on Thursday all day & i can come see it then & if everything checks out it'll be a go. And she says don't worry i'm gonna keep you updated on the vehicle & i'll definitely give you a call Monday or Tuesday so you'll know what's happening. I said ok. That afternoon i got an email from her Manager saying, he's following up along side her & see that i'm in the market for that F150 i inquired on and it's still AVAILABLE, how may we assist you? i replied and got no answer again EVER from him. Monday, NO CALL. Tuesday NO CALL. Tuesday afternoon I CALLED, & she said let me call you back in 15 mins. 15 mins turns into 45mins & when she calls she says the truck is still at the dealership but it should be here this afternoon & i know you said you're working out here on Thursday but we have someone coming out to see the truck tomorrow (Wednesday) & if you're serious i'm just letting you know, but i'll keep you updated on the situation. Now all this is happening around 4:30-5:00 on Tuesday afternoon like i don't have a job & a family so i'm just supposed to drop everything and get out there Wednesday before another buyer gets there to get this truck. Now i saw it as an insult because she said if i'm serious about getting the truck WHEN here's the KICKER, My WIFE and i JUST PURCHASED a FORD EXPEDITION LIMITED EDITION just 2 weeks ago FROM THEM. I still said ok, cause i knew only because i was going to be working out there Thursday. Thursday comes and during a break on my job, i go over there at 12:15 to see if the truck's still available because she said she would keep me updated. Again, salesperson looking for the keys, she sits right in front as you enter the Building but i don't see her. Then the sales guy comes and says my manager is coming over to see you, i said ok. He never comes over. 20 minutes later the sales person comes to me and say, sorry sir but the truck was sold yesterday. All i said to him after i just explained all what i just described was, no courtesy call, no update and it's now 12:30 and the least i could have got was a call seeing i made every effort to purchase this truck. The salesperson was truly amazed and tried his best to soften the blow to which i replied, it's not you sir, but the company you work for & the people i'm annoyed with. So my buddy and i who came with me just left the bldg. & parked on the side just talking about the whole situation & guess who calls from INSIDE. Yes, she does, saying she apologizes but the truck has been sold like she just found out, KNOWING i was inside she never comes out but when she thinks i'm gone she calls, not knowing i'm still outside. I said i don't accept your apology.",US

I recently was nearly stung/ripped off/screwed by that outfit for some $5,500 for a used, 4 year old ATV.  Might not have been too bad; but they use a liberal amount of ""bait and switch"" and lots of pressure in their scheme to get you to hand over your money; especially if you're a senior citizen.  And one should NEVER mention you might be thinking about paying with a credit card!  YOU then become a prime target for every hungry sales person under their roof.   As far as the ATV I looked at and considered buying; I learned it and one they already sold had the SAME VIN, SAME dealer stock number, SAME mileage and as soon as I questioned the info, the one they used as ""Bait"" (different color) was removed from their website stating ""Unit Sold"".  The one I looked at was never shown in their inventory and from what I can determine, must have come from a local salvage yard.  Price to me and MSRP:  $3,799.00 PLUS some $1,700.00 in fees PLUS $900.00 for a 24 month warranty. BTW:  did I mention the dealer had lost the ignition key so I could not hear the engine run or take it for a test ride?

Deciding to trade-in my Ford Focus and buy a new  previously owned vehicle was a little scary. Everything had to come to together just right. First the price. Next, I wanted a vehicle that could pull a camper, but not a truck. No excessive mileage.  I had negative equity in my trade in, which also had some exterior damage. That had to be rolled in with no money down. I didn't want to have to replace tires on the  vehicle I purchased. While being large, it needed to handle like a smaller car not a boat. The engine could have no less than a V6 and a hauling weight no less than 5,000 pounds and come with a tow package already installed.       This was a tall order but RON DONAGHY in sales did an amazing job for me. He not only got me all of this for only $88 a month more than my Ford Focus car payment, but my new used Pathfinder is loaded: Power everything, heated seats; sky light; large navigation screen; second and third seats that fold down completely flat; chrome trim, and much more. I just stopped in on the way to my dentist. When I returned he had arranged for this beautiful new/used SUV to be mine. Three hours later I drove it home.",US

The food is always delivered in a speedy fashion. And tastes amazing. That’s until now.

Not so this time, now it’s not the fact that they didn’t deliver one of the dishes,  nor is that they promised to get the missing to us.

They  contacted me asking me to get  the dog out of there it’s not really being taken care of properly.  I called and it was still available I paid for it and every day I was told it would be vetted and as soon as it was vetted I can come get him.  I went to get him, I paid the adoption fee and noticed he was sneezing and saliva was coming out of his mouth and his nose and the young lady said to me he comes with a warranty,  you can bring him to one of the vets for free and all I knew was I needed to get the dog out of there.  I brought him home they contacted me I said he’s doing just fine which wasn’t true,  but there was no way I was bringing him back to them!  He had no fur on his tail he had filth in his ears, underweight, walking issues and so on! God only knows the last time somebody cleaned his ears he has kennel cough (Pam the store manager told me sometimes after getting their shots this happens) what kind of a rescue gives a 10-year-old dog, sick dog shots without getting it healthy! ￼ today Pam she told me that the dog comes with a warranty you know like when you buy a car,  but I said to her your taking a dog that’s in this kind of shape into your supposed rescue,  if you don’t have a foster to take the proper care of it how do you have the nerve to take this from someone?  I don’t know how they get away with this animal neglect!  I guess they like to take advantage of the perks that come with a 501(c)(3) How is this allowed? I would understand if they took it in and a foster rehabilitated the animal and then it was up for adoption,  but adopting out an animal in this kind of shape and the store manager Pam told me,  well it was like this when we got it! To me this is so￼ unacceptable! I’m sick to my stomach that for whatever reason after 10 years a family had to surrender a dog like this and a rescue such as the one in this puppy mill store would accept it!

I don’t think they realized the problem it would cause me.  When I left home I had a four sided chain linked fenced yard, now the back corner was missing.  I went over and spoke to the fence company and told them I didn’t think it was right that they caused this problem for me and I wanted my fence back.  They went and got it and tossed it back in my yard.  I asked them the name of their company and started taking some pictures.  A man came back over and asked me why I was taking pictures, and I told him to document the problem. He then came in and put up a temporary piece of fence to keep the dog from getting caught between the two fences. I then contacted the company, the girl I spoke to was very nice and asked that I send the pictures, which  I did.  I Jasso sent them three suggestions of how to fix the fence.  I didn’t hear from them.   I waited a week and emailed them again, no response.  My daughter used Superior Fence in the past and said it was a good company, I wish I could say the same thing.  If you value your neighbors, or want a company with a good reputation that takes care of problems, I wouldn’t use this company.  I still don’t think it’s right that while I was away at work this company came onto my property and remove part of my fence, and not be willing to come back and fix it.

I had a hernia removal with Dr. Simon D. Eiref, Jusha Bonsell and Dr. Tran which looks Chinese to me. Without my consent, they used me on a medical experiment. They Implanted something on my left ear and when they have the group there and I am 50 feet away, there is an alarm that rings to notify everyone that I am close by. Him and the rest of these doctors had injected stuff on my crown chakra, my left, my uterus, my pelvis and he told me that I had endometriosis after I woke up from the surgery. He told me he cleaned it when in fact, he had injected some sorts of gel around the area and some weird other stuff that came out after I did a vaginal detox.  What made this whole thing weird is that they were able to monitor my every move. It does not matter where in the United States that I am, they know my exact location and were able to quickly send some of their doctors and team there. They flat out lied in order to be in the same space I am. They had different doctors and other people using this program on either their phone or computer to shock the part where these implants were located. So, they can arouse me on the spot and I believe the whole point that they sleep with me. Have as many people sleep with me which is technology raped. This is something they are trying to force me and possibly many other women they think is the perfect person for their narcissist behavior. These three men should not be carrying a license. I had filed many complaints online and all the feedback I left was deleted. I called the hospital many times and they lied and told me he was no longer working there. When I asked if I could file a complaint, the people in the hospital were running around and were covering up for them. If I go to a hospital to check, they called the hospital and since they are very well known, they were able to convince other doctors not to check me. I tried to have an  MRI to see what exactly they had implanted on the left side of my head possibly behind my left ear. Since they can locate me, they lied to the technician and had things covered up. Now that I am in a different state, they are constantly having me watch because they do not want this to blow up. I am guessing that is what happens when you take a group of con artists and people who are rapists or have a rapist tendency and give them license to treat people.

Pennsville Auburn Rd. in Carneys Point, New Jersey before beginning our family vacation. Please note that this was our first time ever staying at a Red Carpet Inn and as today was our first day back home, this was the earliest we could inform you of our stay. Due to the conditions we encountered, I thought it would be appropriate to inform you that we were very unhappy with our stay at your establishment. As we pulled into the parking lot a little past 11:00 pm, we noticed that there was trash strewn outside throughout the parking lot, including a New Jersey license plate that was stuck in the fence. As we entered the door outside of building 300, there was a lot of broken glass outside the entrance way to the point where I had to inform my children to be careful as we were entering. This was not a very good first impression, and it gave us a sense that we were not in a safe neighborhood. Upon entering the building, there was a strong smell of cigarette smell that permeated throughout the hallway.  We entered room 319, and as I shut the door, I noticed that the sliding lock had been broken off the door and when I tried the deadbolt, that also was broken.  My wife attempted to turn on the light in between the two beds and noticed they also weren't working.  Additionally, the top drawer of the dresser by television was broken.  The headboard of our bed (closest to the window) and the picture above it appeared to have something brown sprayed on it, as if maybe someone opened soda or something that sprayed and dripped and was allowed to dry as is without ever being wiped off. When I entered the bathroom (prior to anyone else), I noticed the following things: toilet seat was peeling, a pubic hair on the toilet, toilet rocked when sat on, bathtub was cracked and appeared to be dirty, corners of the bathroom floor were dirty, and there was water all over the sink area's countertop. Here is a short list of some of the other things we noticed that were less serious: Bed was stiff and uncomfortable Pillows were flat and lumpy - and we only had two per bed Peeling wallpaper Holes in the wallpaper (as if something was once there and had now been removed) Coffee maker in the bathroom was dusty no cream / sugar for the coffee maker Continental breakfast suspended due to COVID-19 - We understand this, but no alternative was offered I'm embarrassed to admit that the only positive thing we found was that the beds did NOT have bed bugs.

The technician George who came out on Friday called me on his way out asking me how old it was and what was wrong. I could tell by his tone what was coming, based on age you need a new air conditioner. He comes in no tools, puts two new batteries in the thermostat because I told him I changed them but wasn't sure how old the batteries were. Checked the filter in the bsmt, went outside looked at it, came back in told me it was out of coolant and was a total system failure. He said he didn't have any coolant with him or he would try to fill it. Asked me if I wanted to fill out an application for a new one. I said why not, we did it didn't get approved. Than he asks me how old I'm. I told him and he said well I'm not leaving you like this, its going to be in the nineties today. He proceeds to go out and get the coolant he told me he didn't have with him. He said he filled it up with 31/2 tons. Call him back if it goes out again. I had also mentioned same thing happened last year and the technician had fixed part, refilled coolant and it was good all summer and 1/2 of this summer. He tells me that guy didn't fix anything. He tells me maybe he used a stop leak spray. The other guy showed me where the leak was and I had remembered seeing it being wet around there. After he fixed what he said he did I never saw it wet again. After George put in the coolant it ran 24 hrs and stopped cooling again. It was running normal. I called Consumers Energy because it was an appliance plan call.  They said they could only  request a different tech from the same company. She said I was right in calling her back not him. Monday they sent out a guy named Bryan or Ryan. On the work order he wrote Bryan, crossed it out and printed Ryan next to it. Next line the technicians signature was definitely started with a B and appeared to be Bryan. Anyhow he never checked theromostat, furnace, went right out to unit. Had pressure gauges told me it was empty of coolant. He said he couldn't repair because I didn't have gold plan. Than I said if I had it would you repair it?? Questioning if a repair was an option with these guys. He said I was rude, and he thought George was a nice guy and did me a favor putting coolant it. Told me how much it cost to do that $350. plus $85. svc. He said he could take an application for a new one. I said I already filled one out. I called Consumers to see if I could upgrade to a Gold Plan to get it repaired. They aren't doing Gold Plans right now.  He gives me my 3 options, New unit, no unit, gold plan. I said no unit. He goes back outside I hear him on his phone bad mouthing me to George, She this, she that etc. He was on speaker. Than he asks George if he had serial # because he couldn't find it. My point is he was in communication with George the first tech the whole time.  I was worried about just that one tech covering for another working for same company. Called office because work orders copies weren't legible. We were communicating fine till he found out who I was. Than his phone started breaking up, he tells me to call him back when my phone has a better signal. I had been on my phone all morning no signal issues. Coicidence he didn't want to talk to me after talking to George, and Bryan. I wanted legible copies of what work they said they performed. Not much to ask right? Why fix an old air conditioner when you can sell a new one. This service call was just a sales lead to them.  I've cancelled my appliance plan with Consumers, even with the gold its no guarantee you'll get your appliance fixed. They'll just give you a check and total it out for far less than to replace unit. Like car ins., only  they total out your appliance. I read a review where Detroit Furnace tolda DTE energy appliance plan customer he had a carbon monoxide leak.

At about two years, it began having Multiple paint chips all over the vehicle. I took it back to the dealership where I purchased it In Houston. A male employee basically “Dismissed” me saying “Well you live in the country so that likely caused the chipping.” I was so furious I just left. About 6 months later as the chips got bigger, I decided to take it to my local dealer in Brenham Tx. They helped a bit, but Ultimately needed to get corporate approval but then could not provide the paint job because the site did not have an in house paint/body shop. So they directed me to the College Station dealership. Again they tried to help by resubmitting a claim to Hyundai Corporate. Finally after almost 5 weeks the got approval. Then it took a little over a week to paint. When I finally picked up my car almost 7 weeks later, they had only repainted 3 of the 4 areas where chips had been pointed out. Ridiculous that they could NOT CORRECT ALL the areas with chips. One question: should any buyer expect that the paint job on their brand new vehicle last AT LEAST 3Years?!?! Seriously! I have a 2006 Ford white truck. It has almost 200K miles but you cannot find even a handful of paint chips!!! What will this Hyundai look like when it is 14 years old??!! I expected better from Hyundai!! And I deserve better! DO NOT BUY A WHITE HYUNDAI VEHICLE !! Unless you want to buy a lemon and get screwed.",US

I was offered a telephone/video consultation only, not given a timescale for said telephone/video consultation and charged £60 for this - despite me asking the receptionist not to charge my card (mid way through) as would find another vet who could see my poor 10 year old boy. Meanwhile poor boy looked like he was getting sicker and more uncomfortable. I called another vet who was much more sympathetic and understanding about the potential seriousness of his illness.

After giving my order at the intercom to make both my sides a large, once I arrived at the window the sides were bagged as both small.  I informed the woman that I asked for large sides.  She said that it would be an additional charge with which I responded that that was okay.  She then muttered ""Well you don't have to make a big deal out of this!!"" I was flaberghasted to say the least and asked for a manager.  Was informed that manager was not on the premises. I asked for Manager's name and they said Iktris.  I tried calling twice to alert the Manager on what just happened to me but still he was not there.  I called the following morning and he was.  I proceeded to explain my experience w/ Con on yesterday and he was no better.  He yelled ""You people think that you can talk to us any old kind of way! And don't you put words into my mouth!!"" I retorted, with well there is no wonder that your workers behave the way that they do when they have you as a Manager to mimick. The following day (6/29/20), I forged a complaint with Popeyes Corporate office in Atlanta and spoke to Matt.  Matt listened and was very apologetic for the treatment that I received and asked if I'd like a call back from someone.  I said yes.  Well, today is 7/14/20 and I'm still waiting for that call back from Corporate.  This whole thing is unbelievable to me! In the wake of a pandemic, blatant racisms and riots, you'd think that excellent customer svc would go a long way but instead, it's the total opposite.

I bought four tires back in February which turned out to be problematic, chopping, excessive noise, I just wasn’t happy with my purchase.  I stopped in at Mavis and spoke to Dominick, the manager.  I was hoping for some help but wasn’t entirely confident as I selected the tires that were making me unhappy and I was over the 90 day trial period.  So.....I was thrilled when Dominick told me that if I was unhappy, so was he.  Assuring me that he would take care of me, I trusted this true professional and Dominick was a man of his word.  He ordered a new set of tires (my choosing) and squeezed me into a busy Friday afternoon schedule recognizing I wanted new rubber for the weekend.  Tires mounted, balanced, alignment done — my truck now rides straight and quiet....I am very happy.  I expected a pro-rated deal where I would have to pay a percentage of the new tire price plus mounting and balancing, etc.  Nope.....Dominick, the manager of this store handed me my keys and a receipt and told me to have a nice weekend.  I asked....tried to pay for something.....the alignment....something.....I was again told that my happiness as a customer was the most important thing.   I can’t recommend this Mavis location strongly enough.  From Dominick the manager on down, this shop did professional work and took Covid-19 into account regarding my 90 day tire trial.  What a crew!!  I will be buying lunch for these guys for sure!  So, If you are looking for tires and a professional experience - give this Mavis store a shot....ask for Dominick.

They have ignored the fact that they are written in Spanish and are for completely different Companies.  In fact apart from the search engine which I am now going to get rid of because of the Google Corruption factor, Google reviews especially is a very corrupt tool which Google it seems can not manage. In fact Google Contradicts itself time and again with its stock answer to Spam and fake reviews of non violation of its policies. Google is a joke and Karma is coming to get them. I have had three fake reviews today which I flagged and which you have ignored. The fake reviews which you insist is OK.

They have a sign up system where you have to log in to a website to reserve spots at the pool 48 hours in advance for two 3 hour windows Wednesday through Sunday (9 AM-12 PM and 1 PM-4 PM). There are 190 spots and within minutes all the spots are reserved. Many of the reservations go unused while the majority of residents don't get a chance to use the facilities that we pay monthly to use.  Also there is no good reason why they have the pool closed two days a week (Monday and Tuesday) for cleaning. They should also make the pool available after 4 PM each day at swim at your own risk as most people work and can't use the facility since the pool now closes at 4 PM. The rules established show utter disregard for the residents who pay CDD fees monthly for use of the facilities.

I stated that when I turn it off it does not restart for me and I need a jump and asked if they could at least check the battery for me because I cannot be stranded.   I asked the Ford associate if there was any way they could just check to see if it was the battery (I know NOTHING about cars) and the staff member told me that if I needed immediate assistance, that I can take it elsewhere to check.  The car was under warranty so, the battery would be covered.   I was not told that I would not be reimbursed if I went elsewhere, nor I was given an option to leave my car with Ford, as they said that they were super busy and had no time to take the car in (Friday afternoon).  I trusted the associate and I went elsewhere.      I am a single mom of three kids, putting myself through nursing school, and I have a child with a disability, so it was important for me to work with a dealer who had my best interest in mind. I have not had reason to not trust anything Ford has told me in the past, so I had no reason to question Ford this time.  BIG MISTAKE.    I called Folsom Lake Ford, spoke to the associate, and I was informed that there was a mileage limit on the warranty for the battery.  I was told that if the battery was under warranty, then they could photocopy my paperwork and send to Ford where Ford could then process my refund. I said I needed to check my paperwork and if my care was covered,  I would come in with my receipt. I brought my car in and I was told that they do not give refunds for non Ford batteries. I was given Ford's phone number and I was told that I needed to submit this to Ford myself for the reimbursement. Ford said that this was the dealers responsibility.  The dealer said that it is Ford's responsibility.  Please go to a dealer who has a unified service team and is not misleading. Folsom Lake Ford seems to care more about the sales, than the follow- through with efficient customer service.",US

We were not ready for an installation date as we still had plenty of work to do so the rep said they would keep them until we were ready. As the lockdown came to an end I received a call to ask if we could arrange an installation date. I had decided to also price for another blind to cover a set of double patio doors. This guy was less willing to give as good a price so I called the shop and spoke to the owner, price now sorted the fitters came and fitted the blinds! Bish, bash bosh...all done. I had an issue with the patio blind not opening, the fitter rung first to try and sort the issue over the phone, he came the next day.

2944,www.google.com,2020-06-04T06:15:46.000Z,1,tl;dr I'm not fond of Google,"I'll begin my tirade with that while I've come to hate Google over the past 10 years on its own, my true hatred for this site came around the time of their merger with YouTube. First off, while they did offer the option to download your uploaded videos from Google Video before they were deleted they made it near impossible to do so. I lost videos that were near and dear to my heart. Second, in the years since, as I'm sure most of you are aware of, they've made it mandatory to connect a Google account to your YouTube account. This has proven to be an issue for me and apparently many other people who created their YouTube accounts when YouTube was just created and have since forgotten their logins/passwords/15 year old emails or phone numbers. When trying to recover an old account you're given the runaround with the assumption you'll eventually get somewhere when in the end all you'll get is ""Sorryyyyy! You don't know your old password and all of this was a waste of time!"" YouTube aside, from the time Google launched until now it has progressively gotten less functional. There was a time when you could search the most specific sentence you could think of and Google would immediately come up with exactly what you were looking for. Now every search result is meticulously ordered by how much profit Google can make from it and you can't find anything with even the simplest searches. Which brings me to an example (with which I will end this post, because I could go on forever): I searched ""how to review google"" (with the intention of leaving Google dot com a review as I'm doing now) and all of the results were essentially how to leave reviews on things OTHER than Google. I then tried searching ""how to leave YouTube a review"" and of course, it came up with how to leave reviews on YouTube videos. So I thought to myself, ""no this makes sense, I'm just not being specific enough"" and I searched ""how to leave google.com itself a review"", to no avail. I then tried pretty much every combination of words I could think of, and no results. Then I thought ""wait, what if I search 'how to leave businesses reviews'?"", and that's how I found this website. Literally the only way I could find to leave Google a review.  Point is, Google is a well oiled machine that only looks after itself and its subsidiaries and we should be wary of it but ultimately acknowledge that we will never take it down and have to submit to its power. They may seem like a cool business with all of their ""we let our employees sit on beanbags and ride around on scooters!"" nonsense, but they suck. Truly. Put some of your hacky sacking beanbag drones on some phones so us common folk can actually get stuff done and not repeatedly run in circles to whatever a computer tells us to do. Or at least develop a more helpful customer service experience. Lord knows you have the ability to do so. All of that being said, if zero stars were an option I would still give it one star, because when I use it to search things SOMETIMES it gets me the info I need. SOMETIMES.",US

Cameron was very timely in responding to my service call.  Three of the four sprinkler system zones were experiencing low pressure output, resulting in significantly reduced water coverage of the lawn.  Cameron located the valves, which had become obscured due to underground tree/shrub roots, and expertly repaired them to effective working order.  Upon testing the repaired system, he checked to ensure that all the zone sprinkler heads were disbursing water evenly throughout the lawn.  Throughout the repair, Cameron thoroughly explained his process and materials being used to rebuild the zone valves.  My lawn sprinkler system now operates better than it has for the past 10-plus years.  Unlike, the majority of sprinkler repair companies/service providers, Cameron did not market unnecessary repairs or replacement parts.  Veteran Irrigation has the best service rates (parts/labor) than any irrigation service provider that I have come across in the past 25 years.  Cameron also provides a 1year warranty on all work.

Our family booked an overseas tour last year with Tracey Standing of Global Journeys in Noosa Heads, Australia.  But obviously due to the current Coronavirus pandemic, our tour had to be cancelled.  The professional, and helpful advice we had received from beginning to end was second to none.  Tracey’s ‘tips’ on how to best enjoy our (then) upcoming trip was invaluable and very much appreciated.  No matter how trivial, or even on some occasion, maybe ‘silly’ questions we may have asked, Tracey always answered all concerns/questions we had, with the utmost respect and courtesy. Our trip was scheduled for next month, but was recently cancelled, and even though it was very disappointing (as we had been planning this trip for many months), we quickly realised that our ‘inconvenience’ was extremely minimal in light of what many other people and businesses, are having to deal wth due to this current pandemic.  Tracey and Global Journeys have now had to face the arduous task of having to assist so many others (as well as ourselves), in making the necessary arrangements in relation to our cancelled tours.  And of course, all while facing the prospect of their Agency maybe having to make some very difficult decisions for now, and for the foreseeable future due to the current pandemic. We were not only impressed with the always courteous and patient attitude shown us (since first having booked our overseas trip), by Tracey, but to have received such a calm, and professional response from Tracey, all whilst she was inundated with so much to deal with at such a difficult time with so many other disappointed travellers, was even more impressive, to say the least. We truly hope that Tracey and Global Journeys are able to ‘weather this storm’, and will be able to continue giving such great customer service in the future, and particularly after the Coronavirus pandemic eventually becomes a distant memory, for all of us.",AU

The frustration is that there not bad a laptop at all until you realise that they not supported and there is very little you can do to fix or remedy what might be a simple issue. And worst of all Google don't support them. And on top of that, many software companies and hardware companies don't support Chromebook so you'll find yourself not being able to run regular software on the Chromebook. But hey if Google won't support their own software why should other companies support Chromebooks. I can't speak to the maker of the Laptop because there isn't a hardware issue, as I said it's a good laptop. I can't speak to Google on the OS because they don't support it.

Ghosting (i.e. your review not appearing after posting) is a MASSIVE, MASSIVE issue and its NOT GETTING FIXED (Google doesn’t care). The absolute joke of a filter system ends up blocking legitimate reviews that don’t break any rules. You could end up spending a good hour writing a review but once you log out of your account, you’ll find that you're review hasn't been added. In other words, the general public can’t see it. Scrolling down this Trustpilot page I can see the exact same problem has been mentioned by two other Trustpilot reviewers -  ‘David Hampton’ and ‘Customer.’ Its clear this is a widespread problem for many. There is no help. You email Google, but they never reply back. On the Help page their ‘experts’ state, “any reviews using ‘special characters’ such as dollar signs, brackets, asterisks etc are likely to get blocked.” What a complete shambles! Google is a world-leading tech company that invests BILLIONS in R & D yet they’re telling us their Reviews Section gets unstuck by a humble asterisk or dollar sign? You seriously cannot make this s h it up!!! If Google Reviews actually worked, it would be an absolutely fantastic tool for businesses and customers alike - the reviews are automatically linked to physical locations on Google Maps so more people are likely to read them. But sadly it looks like I won’t be placing another review there. Once you get ghosted, you can pack your bags and forget about ever coming back. The problem continues on any new review you submit and your Google account effectively gets shut down.",GB

We ate the mash and corn and had to throw the rest away.  I also ordered 2 chicken littles regular and 2 chicken littles honey BBQ.

What this means is you could be someone with mental health issues and if Google received a warrant they would not fight the request even if the person did nothing wrong in the first place. Inside Google dresses up their company to be security and;privacy-friendly however, in reality, they are the exact opposite as they do what was mentioned above in addition to putting advertisements on, Gmail which is the worst place to put ads.

It took them 4 weeks to resolve the issue and they refused to compensate me until I kept calling every week.  The Asst. Manager Donna was rude and dishonest.  First she told me it was stained, then she told me it the fabric bled when I told her it was never worn.  When asked where my dress was she could not provide an answer.  When asked to speak to the owner she refused to give me his contact information.  She insisted she would speak to him and get back to me.  She told me she would call me every week and did not follow through even once.  Failed to initiate any resolution and take responsibility, be honest about what transpired and offer to make me whole.  Their behavior was so unprofessional and appalling!  If I treated my customers this way, I would not have any!  The situation was completely mishandled from the beginning.  Mistakes happen all the time.  It's HOW you handle them that counts.  Apologize and make the customer whole.  It’s that simple folks!   The owner finally called me after a month went by to inform me the dress was defective and he ordered me a new one.  I had already ordered a replacement dress since my holiday event already took place and I couldn’t wait for them to compensate me.  I will be returning the dress to get my refund since they refused to do so.  The girls who work in the Westerly store are very nice. However, the owner, Bill Fish, and Asst. Manager Donna are completely useless and need a lesson on customer service.   I hope you don’t have this happen to you as you will not be treated with respect or be compensated appropriately unless you call them every week and hound them to do the right thing.

We wondered if the Christmas crackers on the table had been purchased at Poundland, we had exactly the same joke and cheap plastic thing in every cracker on our 2 tables, the worst ones to date than any other venue. The dinner & dance not actually taking place at the hotel, a walk which we were not told about could have been awful if the weather was horrendous or somebody was disabled, we felt that this should have been made clearer. The food was ok and came out hot which was not an easy task with so many people but there really was not much of it and our men were still hungry.  The Pate was a generous amount but you had nothing to eat it all with as it came with the smallest razor thin slice of bread and only 1 piece!!! The halloumi veg dish came with no accompaniments and extra potatoes had to be requested. The squash tartlet was bland and the puddings had literally 3 spots of sauce. This was one of the most expensive dinner and dances and yet sadly it really was not worth that money I’m afraid and £5.50 on top INSTEAD of your pudding for the cheese & biscuits was a rip off, I feel then that we should have been refunded for the pudding that we were not allowed to have despite paying for it in the £61, other venues make it an extra payment but you also get your pudding! Cling film was also found on some of the dessert plates. When we found out who the DJ was we were quite excited and thought it was going to be really good, usually each company is greeted but no, nothing. The dinner dragged on so much that we did not get the disco until gone 10pm though I am sure Mr DJ preferred that, he did not crack a smile and he only spoke to count down how long of the party we had left, considering his past, he was shocking, no Christmas joy came from his mannerism or mouth, when we requested a song he simply said he did not have it. The biggest shock was being told that we were not allowed to take the bottles of wine that we had purchased, I am sure that must be illegal but if it isn’t and this is the policy of this place then I feel that a wine package should NOT be offered OR refunds for the unopen bottles, they really cannot have it both ways...in all of my years I have never ever had this before……we should be refunded for the 5 bottles that we lost! 3 people left the venue hungry, we thought we would go to the hotel and order some bar snacks but there was no food offered, we asked at reception who said that only Cheese, Ham or Smoked Salmon sandwiches with crisps was on offer but we would have to go to our room and order it, though the man took our order we still had to go to the room to receive it and pay… he then told us that he would be the one making them…Receptionist/chef!!?? Bizarre, does he have food health & safety too?   Around 45 minutes later 3 sandwiches arrived, with Dorito’s and NOT crisps at a cost of £26….absolutely extortionate considering the receptionist was making it It is clear that The Lingfield is all about the money but does not want to give the service. Its a shame",GB

Now it tracks everything you do to sell to third parties, it is a terrible search engine now... One time i could type what i wanted to search and i would get that. Now if i type something in, it searches for something completly irrelavant to my topic i searched for. And just to give a rough example: if i were to search google for something like ""why are apples red"" the results would show up for things like: why apples are healthy for you, why apples are good for your teeth and why apples are round. But not one thing about why they are red. (Once again, rough example but you get the idea) its fustrating because if i go to bing or LITERALLY anywhere else i can usually find what i want, with google i can barley ever find what i want now.  You can google search whatever you want, but google will only show you things irrelavant to what you were looking for.

This sinister, CIA seed-funded, data-mining tech firm “shadow banned” SIX of my nine Google Maps reviews at once, without warning, notification or explanation and with no way to contact them for clarification as to why they did this or what amendments they wanted.  Shockingly, I later discovered the Google shadow banners didn’t even want any amendments, because I re-posted two of the one star reviews, with ALL the text removed, just leaving the one star ratings for each one, just to see what the result would be. Shockingly, the shadow banners wouldn’t even let me leave a one star rating at all for one of them, British Transport Police, and only left a solitary one star, without my name attached, for the other review, which was for London Executive Offices 15 Old Bailey. It looked weird, just one star under the company’s name, without the name of the one who gave them one star. Even the star was later removed. Clearly there was something sinister at play, after all why wouldn’t Google even let me leave a one star rating with no review under my own name for London Executive Offices’ 15 Old Bailey office, when they even tell you to write of your experience at a location you visited? And why wouldn’t the shadow banners allow me to leave even a one star rating under my own name for British Transport Police Headquarters Camden Road? Because my “brother” is a British Transport Police officer, that’s why. I then realised that Google is colluding with corrupt English government police forces, a corrupt English law firm and a corrupt English office space rental company to suppress the truth of appalling abuses by these and collusion between these. These institutions and corporations are: 1. Probate law firm Gedye & Sons 2. British Transport Police London Headquarters 3. Cumbria Constabulary Headquarters 4. Kendal Police Station (Cumbria Constabulary) 5. Barrow Police Station (Cumbria Constabulary) 6. London Executive Offices, 15 Old Bailey 7. London Executive Offices, 33 St James Square All of the above reviews give significant mention of the owner/solicitors of law firm Gedye & Sons in order to provide necessary background. I believe that Gedye & Sons was probably helped to approach Google by the Law Society, the lawyers’ representative and protection body, their private club, who are shockingly also allowed by the British government to regulate the legal profession, which means self regulation, which is corrupt. My first ever Google review was for crooked, abusive, fraudulent Cumbrian wills and probate law firm Gedye & Sons, who are based in Grange over Sands, Cumbria, but to my eternal misfortune decided to rent a small shared office space at 15 Old Bailey, London, which is managed by London Executive Offices. It is obvious to me that Google left untouched my initial review of Gedye & Sons but removed six out of seven other reviews linked to that initial review, because they are aiding Gedye & Sons in preventing local residents of Grange over Sands and Cumbria and beyond from seeing the magnitude of British institutional abuse I have suffered from the above corporations and how it is all linked, or anyone reading one review from me, then reading all the other connected reviews to see how corrupt, abusive and crooked British institutions are.  Google has joined my corrupt, crooked, institutionally racist British oppressors, abusers and fraudsters. Google has actively helped cover up British corruption and oppression in its institutions, which is rife. I mention in many of my reviews that when I visited the City of London Police and reported the hostility, manipulation, abuse and coercion I suffered from one of the owner/director/solicitors of Gedye & Sons in his 15 Old Bailey office, they told me what he did to me was FRAUD. Google removed this information with the reviews also, covering up confirmed fraud perpetrated on me by a senior solicitor/director of Gedye & Sons. I have tried to contact Google via Google Account feedback and even resorted to using the Google Maps review process to leaving messages for them, but I have received no replies whatsoever from them. Some of the reviews shadow banned by Google are on Trustpilot in similar forms, such as my reviews of the British Transport Police and London Executive Offices. I also have a Trustpilot review of Cumbria Constabulary in a different form. I have also noticed that shadow banners Google have censored my Trustpilot reviews of British Transport Police AND Cumbria Constabulary from appearing in any of their 10 pages of search results, using different search terms. This is absolutely outrageous and a massive cover up from US military, CIA and NSA contractor Google. Google is aiding corrupt British government corporations in a cover up at my expense.  Google tells us in their user review guidelines to “be nice to people” and “don’t attack people”. Really? That’s a bit rich, coming from Google, since Google is a part of the US military/industrial/intelligence/information complex - a truly evil war machine not at all known for “being nice to people” and “not attacking people”. Google tells us not to do things it actively does itself. Google says “Don’t be evil” Really? I think Google is telling us not to be evil, it is not saying it is not evil. Google removes honest, accurate, truthful, heartfelt reviews without warning, notification, explanation or any way to appeal or contact them - that’s not nice! This year (2019) Google removed ten years worth of blog posts from a gay blogger with no warning, explanation or any way for him to download a copy of his blog and they refused to tell him why. That’s nasty, not nice! Google, through Youtube, has been deleting many accounts with years worth of videos in a vicious Modern Day Book Burning, a massive attack on Free Speech and Expression. Google has a history of censorship and is anything but a Free Speech advocate, despite its empty lip service. They have a history of censorship and cover up on behalf of corporations and government institutions. Even when I edited and re-posted my review of Gedye & Sons, which has remained untouched by me for three years, the whole review disappeared, causing me even more anxiety! They saw fit to block the re-posting for days, while they “scrutinized” the post, before finally allowing my re-edit. So they didn’t even allow me to re-edit a three year old review without blocking and scrutiny on behalf of their corrupt collaborators Gedye & Sons and the Law Society.  I believe that a lot of what I have suffered from these English lawyers, police and companies involves institutionalised racism from an all white law firm (both in Cumbria and London), all white police in Cumbria, Essex and the British Transport Police that have dealt with me and white management of London Executive Offices.  If Google remove my reviews, partly because I state I am experiencing racism, then they are racist. They are covering up reports of institutional racism.  My African mother died leaving a will in which she made me, my brother and our uncle executors of her estate. My so called British Transport Police “brother” used his English solicitor sister in law and the crooked Cumbrian probate firm Gedye & Sons to help him commit perjury and fraud in order to remove me from active involvement as an executor and carry out the estate administration behind my back, without my consent or signatures. The corrupt English probate court system helped them to do this, then disclaimed responsibility. My review of Kendal Police Station told how when I travelled all the way from the south-east of England to the north-west of England to the main office of Gedye & Sons in Grange, Cumbria and asked to see the owner/solicitor, he stormed out to meet me shouting “Get out of here, you! Get out now! You’re trespassing”. He took my backpack and threw it outside on the concrete, then called Cumbria police. I decided to wait for the police to report his aggression to them but I shouldn’t have trusted them because when they arrived, racist, corrupt, white Cumbria police colluded with racist, corrupt, white Cumbrian solicitors and arrested me, taking me to Kendal Police Station, where I was held for almost 24 hours. Google removed this. My review of Cumbria Constabulary speaks of how when I visited Gedye & Sons in Grange over Sands with my own proof of executorship and asked for my mother’s estate information, staff asked me to wait in reception, then secretly called Cumbria police behind my back, keeping me waiting for 20 minutes while they waited for the police. Just before the police arrived, two staff came out to meet me and pretended they wanted to help me, but when I began to respond, the female office manager suddenly said, “I’ll have to stop you there, because we were told by the directors to call the police if you came to the office and they are now here”. They set a trap for me to be harassed, abused and even arrested by the racist Cumbria police again, but they didn’t know I had audio recorded everything. A complaint made to Cumbria Police was treated appallingly by a crooked female sergeant 1661 of Barrow Police Station, who never addressed my complaints and spoke to the solicitors about me, passing on confidential information, while deliberately avoiding speaking to me. She sent a secret log to the complaints dept., that was filled with lies about me from the solicitors and the officers. She colluded with the Cumbrian solicitors, said I had mental health problems and was guilty of “criminal harassment”, when she is a criminal cop. She told them I was threatened with arrest because I refused to leave when asked, a blatant lie! She tried to get the firm to take out an injunction on me. This is how she dealt with my complaint. Google removed this. The reviews of the British Transport Police and London Executive Offices Google removed are on Trustpilot.",GB

Google customer service actually do their best to resolve your problem, but, if they are sat in another country trying to resolve a problem on a £799 phone remotely, there are so many things you can fix remotely. You can't fix a faulty battery remotely, or any faulty hardware for that matter of fact!. If I spend £799 on a fruit company's phone, then I can walk into a store and get a resolution. But with Big G, my only option is to send the Pixel 2XL off to a service centre and hope that I was correct or else incur a charge for a replacement, or wait without a phone while someone determines if I was right or wrong. The actual process is quick, but it's not okay to be without a business tool for that amount of time. It's also not acceptable to have a chunk of my money (the phone wouldn't be worth that fully working on ebay or anywhere else) while they determine the problem. The other problem is that the back and forth with checking the condition of the phone (I'm now on my 3rd exchange of emails) means that I'm now a couple of days into the process without resolution. Pros 1) Help chat directly from the phone is great! 2) Service to replace is quick once it has been determined it should be replaced (previous experience) Cons 1) Actual process is extremely poor, no consideration for how customers use their products or a service that I want to use. Might be a strategy to make you not return it 2) Questions, or troubleshooting, about how you use the phone (like use the original charger only, etc) are a little basic. I expect the phone to work on a battery charger for example because if the battery is giving problems, then I'm tethered to a charger. In summary, it will be extremely difficult for me to buy the next iteration of the Pixel phone, I've had a nexus or pixel for 6 years but I am so dependent on having a working phone for so many reasons, i can't take the risk of having to go through the phone resolution process.",GB

I sent in the phone and took photos before packaging in the prepaid package sent by Google. When they received it, they claimed the screen was cracked and only refunded a portion of the quoted $152 with no photo evidence of their claim. I sent in my photos and said I expected the full quote or to have my phone returned. They replied stating that they would refund the remaining funds as a Google store credit and I told them there was nothing more that I would like to purchase from their store, instead preferring to have it refunded to my credit card. They agreed and said they would escalate the case and have my refund send to my credit card. It is now more than 2 weeks and Google has yet to refund the full amount despite saying they would return it to my credit card. They have lied about the condition of my phone without proof (even after I asked them to prove it), and now they are not responding to my emails.

After telling Google that I was stuck in Chicago in the worst storm since the 70's I believe, and after providing hotel and flight receipts for my trip they rejected my claim advising me to call UK Mail. Their courier, not mine! UK Mail stated that Google would have a direct line to them and need to file a dispute with them so that it can be sorted. Google refused saying that I needed to contact them. Stalemate. Nothing I could do except file a dispute with AMEX to get my money back. They were very helpful thankfully!

The email response I received indicated I would get a call back within 2-3 hours.  Instead, I got a telephone call at about 2:15 in the morning from a customer service rep in the Caribbean. I was really upset about this, as a telephone call in the middle of the night is usually not a good thing....in other words, it alarmed me a lot!  It turned out, that the CS could not help with my question, as she didn't have tracking capability and then told me that I would have to stay on the line 10-15 minutes while she ""tried"" to connect me to Shipping and Returns.  She further said that Shipping & Returns didn't have a toll-free number and that was the reason she had to be a conduit to that group.  By this time, I was beside myself and told her that I had never experienced such poor customer service in my life.  Now, in looking at further options, I see that there is no way possible to actually get some help from Google.

I told Matt to cancel the account, he told me I would get charged this reoccurrence fee.  I said not to, there is no money in that account.  He said he would waive the fee.  Matt gave me a glassy evil terrible look on the way out, and sure enough allowed a charge to go through the next day.

You get a refurbished phone. The same make and model but it is someone elses that has been repaired and given to you therefore could have been purchased before yours and have more miles on the clock.

I purchased some items from a website claiming to sell Italian made items. I contacted the website and got written confirmation that the items will be designed, produced and shipped from Italy. So I ordered a few items. But as I found out MADE IN CHINA, PROMOTED ON THE WEBSITE, AS DESIGNED; PRODUCED AND SHIPPED FROM ITALY. When the time came to get the items I got DHL tracking number and after checking, I noticed my order is coming from HONG KONG. I contacted the company but they told me is cheaper to send from Italy to china and back which made no sense. I couldnt do a thing about that and ended up losing over 500euros. The company devised and uses legal loophole marking the item as custom. Therefore no payment protection plan is possible. They also threaten me with a lawsuit if I keep posting reviews of what they did to me. I did the only thing I could, posting reviews and comments to warn people on the internet to be careful to buy from this site.  But all the reviews and comments that have connection to google such as google maps, youtube etc. even the sites that I logged in through using my google account were censored and removed without even telling me. The site that I was scammed and robbed by, must be paying google to let their site come higher in the search results. And also they must be paying them for advertising the site. Therefore making them a paying customer of google.  I do not understand that google uses this kind of tactics to protect their paying customers, even if the company is cheating and stealing from people. I have tried to contact google but there is no specific way to get to the correct person to present the documentation and finding that I gathered.

3595,www.google.com,2018-05-04T16:04:20.000Z,1,Utterly awful customer service - do not buy from Google Store,"Short version: Google Store UK support's motto should be ""Tell a giant billion dollar mega-corporation that cares."" They mucked me around for two months before finally agreeing to replace my faulty phone under warranty.  Long version: I have just spent 55 days battling with Google Store UK support, attempting to have them honour my warranty claim for a faulty Pixel 1. As a buyer of Google's very expensive (and at the time) flagship phone, the way my warranty claim was handled should be seen as nothing less than an utter failure and embarrassment for Google and whoever handles their support processes.  The phone was demonstrating severe battery degradation problems, to the point where from a '100%' charge (according to the phone's own battery monitoring system) it would not remain powered on in standby for longer than an hour before crashing, requiring a power cable to boot up, and then 'charge' again from a flat state. It was totally unusable on a day-to-day basis. Despite this clearly being a hardware issue, I went through the process of pulling a bug report, taking screenshots of the battery usage graph, and sending this to Google support, at their request. My assumption was that their vaunted 'engineers' would quickly discover there were no software issues (this problem was present in a factory reset state after all) and I would soon be offered a remedy under warranty.  How wrong I was. Finding myself having to constantly chase up the 'progress' of their engineers with emails and phone calls, I was repeatedly fobbed off with nonsense excuses and given no details on what it was that they were actually doing to resolve my issue. The only thing I got was scripted canned responses and vague suggestions that the next Android security patch would fix the issue. Quite how a replacement battery was going to be delivered over the air was not addressed. Over the course of two months, I went through three deployments of Android patches (including the first which dropped around the time of my initial complaint, which I was asked to ensure was installed before sending my first bug report), and after each one had zero impact on the defunct status of my phone's battery, I was again told to pull a bug report and submit it to the mystical 'engineers'. At one stage, having been told in writing that a replacement device would be offered, support then rescinded the offer and told me to wait for yet another bloody Android patch, and to report back after that had been deployed. Outrageous. By now it really felt like I was just being taken for a fool. Numerous different agents handled my case at various points during this debacle, and their attitudes ranged from apathetic (and in one instance very rude as I was clearly being ignored while I spoke), to genuinely helpful but ultimately ineffective. I was offered Google Play credit twice by way of appeasement (the first offer didn't even land in my account, while the second did), which is not particularly desirable or useful to me in general, and in this specific case, utterly useless, as I had no working phone on which to use an app. Finally, after being mucked around and left without a working device for 55 days, I was offered a replacement refurbished phone (for a second time), as I should have been within the first couple of weeks of this process. Thankfully this arrived swiftly.",GB

When the advice he gave me obviously failed, he told me they may be able to help if I pay $150 for them to unlock my phone.

The take home version is that Google are happy for you to pay a premium price for a product but will provide budget service. They are no Apple. Stick with Apple if you're thinking about switching. I bought a Google Pixel on Project Fi and also purchased the extended device protection. After 14 months the microphone stopped working after an operating system update while I was abroad. I went online to the Google support forums and tried all of the suggested fixes, including a hard reset but this didn't help. I contacted Google customer support via the support app on the phone.  - The first representative said they couldn't help as they were from the Google UK team. They promised that they would pass my case to the US team and that I would get an email back. THIS NEVER HAPPENED.  - When I got back to the US, I contacted Google again via the app to report the issue with the microphone. The app again connected me with the UK team who said they could not help and didn't know why I hadn't been contacted by email.  - I rang Google's customer services and after explaining the issue was told that the only way to resolve this was to claim on my extended warranty, including a $70 excess fee.  - After doing this I saw online that a number of other customers had experienced the same issue and some had even organized a class action lawsuit against Google about this. A number of customers who hadn't purchased the extended warranty reported being given replacement handsets at no extra cost, even though they were beyond the initial warranty period.  - When I called Google to enquire about this and to find out why this hadn't been offered to me, the first call handler HUNG UP the call having been totally uninterested in helping.   - I rang back and had to wait for 20 minutes to speak to a supervisor who advised that she could not review the previous call as it hadn't been logged on their system. She also advised she couldn't see any of the account notes from my previous messages and calls. She promised to check with a product specialist about my issue and follow up by email in 5-7 business days. After 2 emails saying she was still waiting to hear back and promising to continue to resolve my query, she stopped emailing.  - Nearly 3 weeks after receiving an email promising me a response in 5-7 business days I emailed back to ask for an update. In response I received an email saying ""the case has been moved to email queue. As the account is not authenticated and therefore, I'll not be able to check for the details via email. I'd request you to please contact us again via phone and mention this case ID, so that next agent will help you directly.""  - When I called up, the Google representative I spoke to (1) couldn't access the case associated with the case ID I had been provided; (2) needed me to explain in detail the entire issue that had resulted in the call; (3) placed me on hold for a total of 30 minutes while he tried to get a response from a product specialist. I was then put through to a product specialist at Project Fi who advised that I needed to be put through the Google Store customer service team. I then spent another 90 minutes on the phone, much of it on hold, only to be told that they weren't the department that could deal with my issue but promising to chase up the previously raised query soon.  - In addition to this frustrating, fractured and inconsistent approach to customer service, my replacement Pixel began to malfunction, requiring a further replacement under my insurance. I have lost any faith that Google know how to run a consumer goods company. Their representatives, even when polite and well meaning, do not have access to information about your account that falls outside of their division. They also have insufficient autonomy to rapidly resolve issues. I have been interrupted, hectored and condescended by their staff in a way I have never experienced when dealing with Apple.

Google Clueless,"My credit card showed Fraudulent charges for Google Services.  10 charges showed up within a few minutes. I called Google support.  They said the charges did not come from my account, but my credit card was used.  I asked Google support what product or service my card was used for.  Google support said they were unable to tell me.  My on line AmEx account had additional information including seller ID and Google Services transaction number, but Google support was not interested in that information. I asked to talk to the supervisor.  I gave all the same information to the supervisor and got the same responses.  He said he was the end of the line and no one else at Google could help me.  He was pleasant and apologized for the inability for Google to provide any help with fraudulent Google Services charges. I called AmEx after getting off the phone with Google.  They gave me the name of the Google services business that made the charges.  It was in China and fraudulent charges from multiple other credit cards were also made to the same China company.  The credit card number, expiration date, and security code were all used for the fraudulent charges.  AmEx fraud department is working the case.  I am guessing someone sold a database with credit card info to the China company. Google has as much or more compute power than AmEx.  Google should use some of its compute power to do the same fraud detection and prevention for Google Services that American Express.  I will avoid doing any card transactions through Google whenever possible until they get serious about providing value add to their services.",US

We phoned Google and we emailed google to tell the m that we do not the people that gave us a bad review and that these people had no evidence pictures or otherwise to justify such a review. Their email replies below are exactly what the culture of the this egotistical company is about. Theys till have not replied to my request to removed altogether from the review system We do not know these individuals as they are not our clients and we do not have their addresses. for us to take them to Court, which is what Google are asking a small business like ours to do. Instead of investigating these people who gave us a bad review with no evidence at all. So how do we pursue someone in a court of law that we do not know. We do not know who these reviewers were or their addresses. So Google has a legal and moral duty to remove these reviews as Google themselves have no evidence that these people have a right to do a review on our Company. They never ever visited our premises so their review is false. I am sick of Google and I am going to remove Fleur De vie entirely from your review systems and I am now going to reveal this case to Trust Pilot and any other review platforms I can get hold of. Google has to be exposed for its corrupt policies about reviews once and for all. They are refusing to remove my company from their search engines, why? They are like bullies that do what they want. Google have to be exposed for what they are they make the rules up as they go along. They are without doubt a Company that lacks common sense and ethics do not exist.entirely.  They have made money by mistake and luck. The owner should be put in front of a Parliamentary Committee to answer these questions I am asking them. Fleur De Vie wrote to Google: You have allowed unknown persons to make reviews about our Company who have never had any services from our Company. How on earth can you justify this???????? Please can you let me know how to remove our company entirely from the Google Search engines and review systems. I await your reply with urgency. It is yourselves that should be pursued in court as we can prove that these people have never ever been to outré shops so how can you justify not removing these reviews.""

We have received your legal request. We receive many such complaints each day; your message is in our queue, and we'll get to it as quickly as our workload permits. Due to the large volume of requests that we experience, please note that we will only be able to provide you with a response if we determine your request may be a valid and actionable legal complaint, and we may respond with questions or requests for clarification.

We have received your request regarding the removal of a business listing. Please note that Google reviews are a forum for users to share both positive and negative opinions. At Google, we try to help our users find and learn about places that they are looking for in the physical world. User reviews help users learn about a business, so we do not remove reviews unless they violate our policies. We also will not be removing the entire business listing from Google Maps, nor can it be removed. If your business received a review that you don’t agree with, we encourage you to use business owner responses to reconcile the situation with the customer. We know a negative review can be frustrating, but we believe that engaging with a customer to address his or her concerns creates the best environment for our community. Regards, The Google Team ________________________________________ Let me tell you we had asked for the false and corrupt review to be removed and then we asked for ourselves then toi be removed in view of their disgusting attitude towards small enterprises that are being slandered at the hands of Google. Google can not even answer our queries without lying and asking us to take these people to court when we do not have their address is remarkably lie a kangaroo state. It beggars belief that Google actually think in this way. They are stating above that they will not remove my business from Google and that they do not have to. This against my human rights in the UK. GOOGLE is a bad unethical Company be warned everyone.  Fleur De Vie",GB

For a reason that google could never explain, my google account had a hold that prevented me to buy apps through credit/debit cards and also did not allow me to redeem gift cards. It all started on a Wednesday where I made my first call. In that call they told me that they had to pass the case to another department and the process to solve it would take about 24 hours when they would send me an email indicating the solution. 24 hours later I call again since I had not heard from them. At this time I was told the same thing as the first time. I told them that my impatient to resolve the case was to buy some apps that were special for thanksgiving dates, but they tried to reassure me by saying that these specials usually lasted throughout the Christmas season. Again they told me to wait 24 hours where they were supposed to contact me with the solution. 24 hours later they did not answer. I go back and I call, on this occasion I was told ""Wait always has its rewards"" to fall in love with they... This time I was told to wait 12 hours for the final answer. 12 hours later I call again, this time the customer service told me sharply ""anyone who calls every day will not expedite or solve the problem"" and to top this he told me to wait 3 days for the solution. LOL, I laugh because to summarize, I had to create another account to redeem the gift card but it was to late, the apps had gone up in price. Ironically, within 2 days of doing this I get an email from google saying that they had already solved the problem of my account ... 2 WEEKS AND HALF to solve this. THAT'S WHY APPLE IS APPLE ...",US

Ox1 1HF. I received no actions and no replies. I walked to see them more than 6 times. 
   From 29 Jan 2015 to 1 June 2015, we reported the failure of essential service of the floor heating on 29 Jan to 15 April 2015. My son suffered in cold winter for more than 3 months. The room temperature was continuously below -2 to 2 degree in month of Jan/ Feb 2015 and most of the nights were 0 deg C in March 2015. 
   The technician took a month to order and replaced the thermostats, but it fails to work. He told me that, in Empress Court, many units have the same problem as electrical heating mat is not functioning, after 15 yrs. They cannot replace the mat by digging up the floor. 
   The Manager,  Richard Goodwin has promised to compensate us £350 and said this is under his sole authorities, as we suffered more than 3 months of cold winter and also we have to buy a portable heater. After we checked out on June 15, 2015, he said that the landlord disagreed to pay. He has ignored all our calls and emails. 
   Richard has a good win!

3823,www.google.com,2014-05-25T22:01:11.000Z,2,Google is disgraceful when you need help.,"It has been over 30 days since I signed-up for the Google product Adsense and my account has neither been approved or denied. There is not anything in the help or support sections that I can use until Google tells me what is going on.
 Google makes it impossible to contact them directly and actively uses its technology to avoid interaction.
  I do not want you to just believe me. I want you to test the Google help and support features before you sign up for a Google program and see for yourself. Ask yourself- is this a level of support that is satisfactory for me? 
 Google would rather customers rely on user forums for problem solving. Even if I give Google the benefit of the doubt and they just want customers to help each other to build some sort of peer team spirit, there are some very good reasons user forums are questionable for customer service.
 1. There is not any obligation on the part of other users to answer a question so many questions go unanswered.
 2. Many well meaning members of a user forum are not familiar enough with Google products or providing customer service and will give incomplete or overly technical answers that are useless to the help seeker.
 3. Google is weakening itself. Google.s competition could easily be monitoring Google's user forums for technical information and weaknesses in Google products that can be used to build something better. Making customers rely on each other makes it easy for them to give away valuable product details publicly. Frustrated customers are going to feel obligated to post the technical details of  the Google products they use all over the internet seeking help with their problem if Google does not provide direct product troubleshooting service of its own products. Thus, by providing poor customer service Google is pushing customers to give away its secrets.
 I was lucky, I found out about Google’s lack of customer service before I signed-up for a Google application that required a payment. What Google seems to be forgetting is that first impressions count for so much in business and there are now many others out there like me who may never trust Google with a paid product because of Google's attitude toward customer service.
 The other thing Google forgets is that my success using their application also allows Google to earn additional revenue.
 Hold on. Wow. Suddenly I am not so upset. Google's lack of customer service is costing them money as well. When I multiply it out for everyone Google is probably frustrating with its customer service policies, Google must be developing a serious revenue leak somewhere.
 Hey Google-let me remind you that there was another seemingly unstoppable internet powerhouse that failed because of poor customer relations as much as any other reason: AOL. Think about it.",US

 Try to Goggle(!) on ""google account suspended"".

And they're new my channel set up sucks.  I was asked if I wanted to switched, I said no, I back weeks later to find it has been changed.
   On google plus you are required to use a real name.  Why can't I use shepard of peace?  What if I don't want people to know my real name?  What if I don't want current or future employers to find me on google+?  Why can't I decide what is best for me?
   Google gmail's new page is slower and harder to see.  Luckily though I have been allowed to switch back to the old format.
   I don't like having my browser history stored online, luckily you can turn that off, but for those who do not know how to turn this off and may not know it is being stored online, this is not fair to them.

   I have been using Google for 11+ years since i had my first laptop, and am spoiled because I always get what i am looking for before I finish my keywords.
   Google search makes keyword search an Art. I was almost addicted to the beauty of getting what you want by the best keywords combination. I like how I beat myself, and I like how Google surprises me by giving me something out of expectation -- yet related.
   Search engine opens up my world. It shows you how much 1 word means, and how 1 word x 1 word can be bigger than 1 Million. 
     Gmail is one brilliant product. It shows you how to think out of the box, and you can always make sth better, make ""unlimited"" possible. 
   Since then we have Google Docs, Google Maps, Google Translate. Not just by using them -- they teach me new concepts by being a google product itself. Search for ""Google Translate"" and you will learn about ""statistical machine translation"". I want to know how I get my results when I search it for different purposes, and I want to learn the brilliant ideas behind it -- it looks 100% random, but it isn't. It cares if I get the best of what i need before I realized it.

   However, when using Google Search for looking up certain niche topics or even quite specific searches, Google Search overrides your query and the pages often do not contain elements the original search terms.
   Should you check the cache, you will often be confronted with a message telling you that pages linking to this page contain your search query while the page you end up on does not and that's if you're lucky!
   I would appreciate a simple check box that performs a verbatim search for the exact words that I type in. No automatic ""behind the scenes"" suggestions, no dropping very important search words, no replacing ""GLSL"" with ""HLSL"" behind my back for example, and so on.
   Just a ""Give me what I asked for exactly"" option for those specific times! Please.",US
