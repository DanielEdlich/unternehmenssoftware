And crushing innovation as well.  Both OS and application software lacks a quality feel, consistency and useability. Something that Apple have managed decades before Microsoft (and Microsoft copied badly).  At least ancient Windows 3.1 was consistent. Since then there's been a dumbing down of GUI's, complete with every MS developers own favourite way of doing things creating a dragged out inconsistent interface.  Been using Microsoft products early 1990s. The fundamentals haven't really improved; a company more interested in future products, which are always a year or so away, rather than delivering good quality consistent products to the user now. Could be argued everything up to Windows XP was just a massive fix for something that wasn't fit for purpose or even a proper OS. On/off hit/miss versions of the OS since.  And remember we've moved from software licensing where you had a right to use the software you bought, to rights restricted to particular hardware, to  subscription limited usage. And in future a secure computing platform tied to Microsoft products entirely.

Which is so far a buggier and uglier version of Windows 10. They aggressively try to make you switch to their Edge browser, with which they are trying to push ads on you. Their Store is unique in a way that it has a lot of bugs so basic things like uninstalling apps is not supported. Unlike all other software stores where you buy software and then you own it that is no longer the case here. Here you just own a license which they can take away at any time and they don't have to provide a reason to do so.  The Microsoft store is also the only store that installs programs in fixed location instead of letting you choose it. They then also remove your access to these folders even though they are on the PC that you own. When you try to force back permissions to be able to access and change the software you bought it will most likely be bricked and no longer useable.  This causes games and software to be unmodible and bricked as time passes on. I wouldn't recommend buying any software at their store.",NL

I am no expert but i suspect this due to the soft rubber-like material Microsoft chose for the keys. This is nice to touch and looks good, but when you actually use the device it will soon get scratches and even worse the top layer will dissolve and the device will look very ugly just by NORMAL usage! This is especially true for the keys you use with your pinkies. So i reached out to MS Support and sent over images of the keys and they created a repair ticket. I thought would be an easy thing to replace the keys or the keyboard maybe as i did not use it any different than intended and was very careful and it shouldnt be that the keys look like somebody used steel wool on it. But what they actually did was... nothing... yet they still did not miss out on resetting my device so that i now still have the same issue with my 9 month old device looking ugly but as a bonus I can also re-setup everything costing me half a day or so. If you dont do anything then DONT DO ANYTHING! So bottom line here is, I will not buy any Microsoft devices again and, if you are planning to buy a device from the Microsoft lineup with those soft plastic keys, either DONT USE IT and just look at it and be happy, use gloves so that it will not get destroyed while you use it or just dont buy any device with that bad material choice and look for a cheaper device from the competition :)",AT

The issue I had went on for minimally 4-months after I inadvertently discovered that my personal O365 account was totally intertwined with an old Microsoft for Start-ups O365 account and an old work email.  I lost track of the number of ""Customer Service"" agents from whom I got emails.   One was a helpful as she could be, although it was clear her hands were tied and there was limited scope for her to truly help.  Countless links were sent to me by other well-meaning ""Customer Service"" agents to solve the problem.  Instead, they kept me in the same terminal loop where these accounts were linked.  No one was able to disentangle the accounts nor to access my computer to solve the issue, even when I granted permission to do so.  The MS4S executive in Seattle was copied in on numerous emails.  No response from her.   Finally I asked an agent to totally delete accounts, which I have no way of knowing if it was done because I no longer have access to the old email, etc.  I was assured it was completed.  I didn't use my personal O356 subscription, even though I thought I was using it, until I discovered that it was the old MS4S account that ""owned"" the subscription.  I asked for a Free 1-year personal O365 subscription to compensate for the endless frustration and time investment their issues caused me.  I was informed their O365 ""Customer Service"" team was not authorized to issue such things.  The executive never responded, either - ever.  No follow-up, no real ""Customer Service"" culture enabled at any level.  I think some of the agents wanted to help.   But the scope for what they were trained to do or were authorized to do was extremely narrow and therefore unhelpful for the customer.  The other reviewer was also right:  If everyone I work with was not so wedded to Microsoft Suite, I would dump it entirely.

That was a joke, but not far from the truth.  Every product over controls the user.  The user can't do what he or she wants with the product without using some type of ""hack"" to avoid what a program forces the user to do.  Documentation has historically been very poor.  It is still poor, but has improved--as have the products over the past 6 or 7 years.  Probably one of the single worst aspects of the various programs is the macro language--VBA or Visual Basic for Applications.  This so-called object-oriented programming language is the single most incomprehensible language I have every worked with.    And I have worked with a lot.  Programming languages for computer products used by the general public need to be based on doing things, not objects which have things done to them.  Most professional computer programmers find the action model easier to understand and apply as well.  Although Microsoft documentation has improved for many of its products, the documentation for VBA still sucks big time.  I can't even find a good book published by a non-Microsoft source that sheds any light on VBA (except for perhaps Excel).  For example, Word has objects.  I can't find a list of the objects found in Word.  Finally, why does PowerPoint not have the ability to write macros?  The macro-writing capability was removed about 6 or7 years ago because of security problems.  Isn't it about time that security issue is fixed?  Finally, the terminology used for the interfaces is never defined. I recently spent about an hour trying to find out what the name of a symbol common to all the Microsux interfaces.  It would be nice to have a diagram somewhere in the Microsux documentation that would identify every symbol used and explain what it does.",US

I don't know why Trustpilot has Microsoft.com as Denmark when it is microsoft_com_da-dk. US people aren't reading this. They need to know also. Trustpilot has reviews for many other US companies. Why not for Microsoft? Trustpilot will not let me paste my text into this review so I will abbreviate.  Microsoft is coming out with Windows 11 on October 5, 2021. Many many users' computers do not meet the requirements to be able to run Windows 11. Microsoft is pushing Surface notebooks for this reason. I believe that Microsoft intentionally programmed Windows 11 software to run only on Surface notebooks and a few computers that have the same specifications.  I have been receiving ads in my email from Microsoft Store stating that Windows 11 comes out October 5, 2021 and that Microsoft is offering the new Surface line with Windows 11 installed.  Microsoft has not even fixed many issues in Windows 10. Search the internet and you will see that reputable websites are giving how-to info to fix problems with both Windows 10 and Windows 11.  I had posts removed from the Microsoft Answers Community because I told people to use disk cleaners from other companies and to use Bitdefender. Windows Disk Cleanup does very little compared to the other software companies.  As recently as August 23, 2021 a very reputable website posted an article entitled ""Windows 11 Bug Breaks Windows Defender App"". So, Bitdefender is needed too.  Microsoft is deceiving many many people. Microsoft doesn't care about their customers. They only care about making money no matter how much they hurt their customers.",US

The only reason why this company's products run smoothly in businesses compared to home users is because business owners have signed exclusive contracts with Microsoft. Otherwise, they would experience the same malfunctioning that home users do. Windows 11 and Windows 10 are both spyware that start to malfunction once you start removing the spywarey part of their operating systems. Windows 11 and Windows 10 are also dumbed down with limited compatibility with older devices compared to Windows 7. Popular computer brands, such as HP, have decreased the amount of personal storage on devices with Windows 11 and Windows 10 for basic users. They are doing this to make working class users slaves to privacy-invasive cloud services that track their online activities with advertisements. Windows 10 and Windows 11 force people to have privacy-invasive advertisement I.D's. Windows 11 and Windows 10 also force updates that have bricked computers from home users. It is why businesses have exclusive updates from Microsoft to prevent their computers from bricking. It shows the cut-throat inequality of service quality between customers and businesses from Microsoft. Also, customer ""support"" service has become a joke towards customers from Microsoft's cut-throat company. Unhelpful bots and Orwellian phone number verification requirement for logging in to a Microsoft account just prove this company does not want to politely mind its own business instead of predatorily stalking other people by requiring their phone number verification when their Microsoft accounts are locked. Bill Gates is just another sellout to the feudalistic elite that thrives on using Orwellian methods to keep working class people enslaved, brainwashed, and dehumanized by making Microsoft have a drastic monopoly on technology.",PT

Really messed up my desktop computer.  I asked for tech help through a chat.  I was 7th in line for service.  The tech page demanded that I not leave that page or I would lose my place in line.  I waited in line from 6:15 PM to 10:30 PM.  They only waited on 6 people in over a 4-hour period.  My issue was that during their installation, I lost multiple Word documents.  Finally, the tech didn’t know which end was up so he transferred me to regular tech support through a chat.  He indicated that my estimated wait time for a chat with them was 10 minutes.  I decided to keep my computer page open to see exactly when they would respond.  It turned out to be 1:43 AM.  Ten minute wait time turned into over 3 more hours!  Did they really expect me to wait until close to 2:00 AM for an answer?  I just assumed the first tech transferred me to a department that was closed for the day.  Ridiculous.  So I waited a total of seven hours and my problem was never resolved.  Luckily, I have a backup system and recovered all of my computer documents, but it took 4 hours to do so.   Microsoft obviously rolled out their 365 Office software when it wasn’t ready to be released.  Has lots of bugs.  I noticed today that I’m having other issues with my computer now that I did not have prior to the installation of this junk.  Buffering.  Photos blinking when I click on them, etc.   I had already purchased Word/Excel a couple of years ago and didn’t plan to update it until I needed a new computer.  Apparently, Microsoft is so desperate for money that they have to charge $100 every year now for their 365 Office software.  Previously, they would allow you to use it for 2 years and it was transferrable if you changed computers, then it changed to one time use per computer.  Now it is every year.  Money grubbing at its best.  Microsoft sells inferior software.  They should be ashamed of themselves, not only for inferior software and money grubbing,  but no customer service whatsoever.  My question is:  Am I going to have to go through this every year when I renew? One other word of caution.  After Microsoft 365 Office was installed, I received a pop up message that someone tried to hack my computer.  Fortunately, McAfee blocked it.",US

Sat at my PC at 11am and tried to sign in but couldn't. I tried several times and it gradually dawned on me they'd deleted it without my consent. So I set up the email account again and tried to change the privacy settings. I was going through the long list of companies turning them off when suddenly the page disappeared and I was returned back to my email homepage. Trust me, I hadn't clicked on anything else other than 'off' in the ridiculously lengthy list and suddenly the webpage was gone. So, from my email homepage I went to my account to complete personalising my privacy settings. I remember it used to be relatively easy to change privacy settings. Several clicks, job's done and in quick time too. It took nearly 1 and a half hours to try and change my privacy settings. They just made it so hard for me to find the page I was on earlier that allowed me to turn off personalised ads, direct marketing, trackers/analytics. So in the end they won and now have use of my data that I don't want them to have. They claim they want my info to improve their products. But they're making so much money off the back of collecting my data usage, analysing how I use my devices, when I use them, what I use them for. And then make even more dosh selling on my information to companies who bombard me with ads selling stuff I don't need or stuff they think I'm interested in because they've tracked, recorded and analysed what's come up on my devices. They should be paying me for being forced to give them my info because they ain't being fair. They've made it harder for me to personalise my privacy settings so I'm not able to do it!!!! About 10 years ago I paid £80 for their software and installed it on my pc. But MS wouldn't recognise the info I entered. I made many fruitless, frustrating attempts to get their product going on my device. I tried contacting customer service. Whether I phoned or emailed them online they never replied. I even asked a friend of mine who's a qualified IT engineer to help me and he said he couldn't. He told me that customers had come to him with the same problem and when he contacted customer service they either didn't reply, or they replied and directed him elsewhere and he ended up going round in circles, or they didn't know what they were talking about and gave wrong advice or he got cut off. And he's a qualified IT specialist and customer service do this to him!!! He said he's so frustrated with them he refuses to deal with them and doesn't use their products on any of his own devices. So, I wasted £80 on software that I couldn't use because MS made it difficult for me, their customer, to set it up on my device. You know what the problem is? Making money is god. The sole focus and drive is toward continually increasing profits. When this happens help and support for the majority of their customers is non existent. If you're a blue chip business/organisation who can afford to stoke the avarice and greed with cash, you get their service and support. But if you're part of what they consider to be the unimportant masses, they sell you their product then just take your hard earned daily wage that you've earned in the sweat of your brow and run.

It spent most of its time in travel to and from Support of which it was never correctly fixed. I gave that one away to a Nephew. Next I purchased the Xbox 360 when they came out thinking that issue would be fixed with the new and Improved Xbox 360. To my amazement,the New and Improved Xbox 360  did te very same thing as the old one, It kept crashing with different games and freezing up. I was told a wide variety of issues could be causing it like the games  I was playing were Corrupt  etc. I thought to myself, I'm done with Microsoft at that point so I gave that Console away and purchased a PlayStation . Oh Wow, I had the same issues with PlayStation as what I experienced with Xbox. It kept heating up even with a cooling fan I purchased. Why, Why, Why do I keep getting these Faulty Consoles. After  a few years, I got tired of that console and Microsoft Now was coming out with the very fast version of their Xbox series X,  so surely I thought they had fixed the issues that Plagued it for years. Some people never learn so I once again purchased another Microsoft Xbox, Now I am feeling so stupid and ashamed to have fallen for their tricks one more and again. Nothing is new with this new Xbox series X other than it loads faster  after Crashing and or Freezing up. I am so sick of these companies Stealing our Money  and not fixing the issues that have Plagued it for YEARS! That says everything right there  but a fool is born every minute they say and I guess I am proof in the pudding because I haven't learned my lesson yet,  I have to admit, I love playing video games when they actually work right, I would NOT, Let me repeat, I would NOT ever recommend anyone to ever purchase anything from Microsoft . They are deceitful and only are out to dig deeper into your wallet. Take it from this fool.They have gotten Thousands of my dollars and have yet to fix their equipment so it will play correctly!  I even filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau which took me nowhere, Microsoft's answer to the complaint was someone would be getting in touch with me and investigate the issues I was having but no one ever did, The BBB contacted me and told me that Microsoft replied to them to close the case. They wouldn't mind the Negative review which would last for 3 years under their name so the BBB closed the case. They said they had nothing else they could do but to say the negative review would stay under their name for the next 3 years. Now I am yet stuck with another piece of Crap from Microsoft that freezes up and crashes continuously. Some games won't even play on this peace of Crap. my advice to anyone who wants to purchase anything from Microsoft is "" STAY CLEAR OR FACE THE HEAD ACHES / ARGUMENTS BEWILDERMENT AND FRUSTRATIONS!  =   You have been warned!  Even a support tech from XBOX  told me on the phone to get an attorney,I would need it.  PS If anyone knows of a Good Cooperate attorney in my area, I would appreciate the information. Thank you, I'm tired of fighting these people . I think they count on that ! My Xbox sits on the shelf unable to play some games to this date. It's left me weak and tired. Help!",US

219,www.microsoft.com,2020-01-27T10:07:56.000Z,1,This is a Review for Microsoft Global.,"This is a Review for Microsoft Global. Issue: Surface Pro 4 - flickering, Flackern, scrambled Screen Payment	Financing Invoice	30 November 2016 Delivered	December 2016 (2nd Wk) Unboxed	24 December 2016 Setup		25 December 2016 Registered	25 December 2016 Office 365	25 December 2016 – 25 January 2018 Standard 	31 January 2018 (1 year) Warranty Extended 3-year Warranty for FREE REPLACEMENT PROGRAM should be	31 January 2020 (1 year + 2 years)  The official invoice of my device reads 30 November 2016. It was delivered around a week later. The device was unboxed on Dec 24 and I only started using the device from Dec 25 onwards. Setting up a new Win 10 device  requires one to use a microsoft account to login to the device and automatically registers the device for warranty.  In my microsoft account – Office 365 ended on 25 January 2018 (including first month free). Also on my microsoft account – device it states that 1-year standard warranty ended on 31 January 2018. Flickering on the bottom line started only around October 2019. My main computer was out for major repair in August/September 2019 and it was only then that the SP4 had to show its worth with music and video editing and  long PowerPoint presentations with integrated music and videos. I must say, the M3 handled the challenge really well, except fot the annoying flickering at the bottom  which disappears when the cursor was moved. In  the last week of December 2019, the device temperature was unusually high and the screen started scrambling. So, as long as the SP4 was just used for surfing, Word/Excel, and reading mails (during the warranty period), it was fine. When it was used for serious computing (after the warranty period), its HIDDEN MATERIAL AND DESIGN DEFECTS manifested themselves. Before the defects manifests itself, the client has no reason to research the web for solutions to the issue, and Microsoft, of course, does not voluntarily inform the client of this problem, although this had been known to them since End of 2015. Microsoft should have sent out a bulletin to all clients and should have recalled all sold devices.  I have contacted Microsoft Support. I was informed that based on Date of Invoice, my device was already out of the 3-year free replacement period and that it would cost me €640 fee for a replacement with a refurbished (REFURBISHED!) device of a higher model. But a HIDDEN DEFECT does not choose to manifest itself within their prescribed period.  And in my case, according to their own records, their warranty period only ended on 31 January 2018. My first contact with Microsoft Support was on 12 January 2020, which would be well within  the 3-year limit for the free replacement program.  A MATERIAL DEFECT remains a MATERIAL DEFECT no matter when it manifests itself. A device with a hidden Material/Design Defect has been defective from the beginning. Microsoft have themselves admitted that this is a hardware/material/design flaw, which affects a „small“ percentage of SP4 devices. Had they known beforehand, such a device, in hindsight, should not have been released for sale at all. The only solution is an outright full refund for the defective device. In My case, owing to the „tender loving care“ that the device had been given, the defect manifested itself at a much later time, giving very little time for the client to search through the forums for answers. For Microsoft to be practicing a rigid legalistic stance so as to pass the cost to unsuspecting consumers is simply a show of power being wielded by a tech-giant, when instead  they should be giving some leeway. On the other hand, Microsoft itself automatically extends, as a matter of principle, the warranty period of 1 year by 5-6 weeks from date of produkt registration. (25 December 2016 – 31 January 2018) So why not use the official Warranty Date? Why insist on the Date of Invoice? Between 30 November and 12 January are 42 Days! Completely in line with the 5-6 Weeks „grace period“ Microsoft itself considers standard and in their best practice. I wanted to return my device and purchase a new higher version of the surface pro series, without hidden defects. However, as a matter of rigid principle, Microsoft does not do such deals.  I have just purchased a brand new Surface Pro 7 for €949. This is €300 Euros more than what Microsoft wanted for a refurbished device with upgraded hardware – they actually don‘t tell you what you would be getting when you surrender your defective device. Microsoft Surface Pro 2-in-1 Tablet-PC are actually great products, if you don‘t happen to get a device with built-in Kinks. But Microsoft Client Support, considering the price for their high-end devices, is the worst I‘ve ever encountered.",DE

Windows suddently told me my legit key was no longer legit after I had to revert back to older system image. I went from Win7 Home Pro to Win 10 Home and I only had my Win7 Home Pro key. The old sys image was a build that did not accept keys from older Win versions. The first tech guy helped me and as a last step (after he ran a few CMD commands) I just had to update windows version and use my old key. Turns out he had helped me, not only update to the right build, but to Win10 PRO!!! Outrageous. I was almost not believed when I contacted support the second time because ""If you see here [remote desktop], you have Win10 Pro"". I had saved the chat log with the other guy, and I had images of myself with my Win7 copy and receipt. In the chat log, I told the first tech guy I had Win7 Home Pro, so lucky for me, in remote desktop, I could highlight that to the second technician and show they had been in the wrong.    I was given two options at first:  -Clean install Win7, then upgrade.  -Buy a Win10 key.   I had none of it, as the mistake was not mine, and I could prove it. They entered CMD, removed the old key and entered an Win10 Pro key. I now have Win10 and ALL MY FILES LEFT!   Warning though: If I hadn't saved the chat log, proving that they did wrong the first time. I would have been a victim, even with my proof of purchase.    Microsoft has A LOT to improve on. This one time though, I got saved.",SE

256,www.microsoft.com,2016-03-30T01:30:34.000Z,1,"Privacy invasive, exposes customer to unnecessary risks","I work with people to improve the safety of their routine digital lives.  It is shocking to me that the biggest player in that space actively forces customers to expose themselves to many unnecessary risks and not only compels needlessly sweeping invasions of privacy but is bluntly unapologetic about it.   Please consider these facts:   With the release of Windows 10 Microsoft entered a new phase in which it forces all customers to maintain a literal 24-7, 365-days-a-year connection to Microsoft servers, without any explanation.  The pretend-reasons offered by Microsoft supporters in their ""Answers Community"" are demonstrably false and Microsoft has been arrogantly unwilling to even acknowledged customers have a right to be informed about what is being done to them, on their own private property.   The answers include things like the need for updates to the operating system or the various unsolicited programs Microsoft installs that are not part of the OS. The fact is that disabling everything that has been publicly identified as functional reasons for the uninterrupted umbilical cord does not result in the cutting of that cord.   There are ways to forcibly prevent these connections but they are well beyond the reach of the typical user. What is proven is that stopping the connection causes no impairment at all to the functioning of the OS. So it is clearly an unnecessary connection.   But the imposed fulltime connections are only one way Microsoft is abusing its customers. It is also forcing them to maintain an attack surface that exposes them to unpredictable vulnerabilities by third party bad actors. Set aside the objectionable attitude that, once you install a Microsoft product, you have transferred ownership of your device and effectively your digital life to them, and instead consider bad actors who are not Microsoft.   A very important good hygiene practice is to not keep code on a device that is not used. So if you do not use a game, let's say ""Candy Crush,"" then it should be removed from the device.  The reason this is important is that every line of code on a device presents an opportunity for hackers to find exploits. Think of it this way: if you were forced to live in a neighbourhood where rocks were constantly and randomly being thrown at your house, you would not install a bunch of extra windows. You might even board up the windows on the main floor in the hope you could limit exposure to one or two upstairs.   Microsoft not only does not follow this basic principle of reducing the attack surface, it forcibly prevents customers from doing so themselves.   Worse, it actively and wilfully deceives customers about the state of their device. When a customer uses the uninstall procedures established by Microsoft - when it allows uninstallation at all -- it is reasonable for that customer to believe they have actually uninstalled that software. But Microsoft does not uninstall lots of software it tells you has been uninstalled. It keeps on your device, sometimes in part and sometimes entirely, the code for the ""uninstalled"" software, exposing attack surfaces you not only cannot defend, but have no way of knowing exist.   I have gone into some detail on these examples for the purpose of demonstrating the bad review is not only reasonable, it is compelling. There are many other instances where Microsoft actively compromises the state of customer devices to serve Microsoft's interests and to h*ll with the interests of the customer.  Sometimes they even admit they are installing problematic code, as in the case of their browser, ""Edge.""  Remarkably, in response to customer complaints that Edge discards the settings they make to reduce surveillance of their internet activity, Microsoft says that it is a factor of ""development"" software and ""everyone has been made aware"" that Edge is not a finished product. They use the broken state of their own product as an excuse for the abuse that product is working against customers. And they completely fail to have any sense of propriety regarding the ethics of forcing customers to have installed defective software -- because there is no way to uninstall Edge.   We should all be appalled that regulators allow this behavior, this rank and brazen abuse of customers by a corporate player who engages in the abuse simply because they can. Their software has become essential to the digital ecosystem and in being essential gives Microsoft license to engage in risky behavior and practice an abusive culture that no other business would be permitted.   So a bad rating?  It borders on the criminal given the outright deception employed. Bad is too kind.   --- NOTE IN RESPONSE TO MS RESPONSE ---   Microsoft's response is simply not true. It is demonstrably false and they know it is false.   There is no setting regarding Updates or *any* *other* configurable setting of Windows 10 that will stop the 24-7 connection to Microsoft servers.  I have personally challenged Microsoft on this deceptive answer in their own ""answers"" community and they have shifted to other equally demonstrably false explanations.   To be clear, I am prepared to provide my personal details to Microsoft so they may file suit against me for libel when I say that they are knowingly lying to customers when they provide these explanations that can be shown in any court to be false. What is truly bizarre and evidence of the utter contempt with which Microsoft regards its customers is the fact that they must realize it is not a difficult lie for anyone with a moderate amount of technical interest to confirm for themselves.It is a simple matter of acting on each of their successive cover stories, starting traditionally with this one, the ""updates excuse,"" and testing after each whether or not the permanent connection to MS servers stops. It does not.   Moreover, even if a reasonable person accepted the declarations at face value, it would make MS practices no less hostile. The updates system does not require a full time connection. It requires a periodic check to see if any updates exist and, if as in 29 days out of 30, there are no updates, the connection can be closed.  Almost every other software vendor in the world, including those explicitly involved in security such as Symantec, McAffee, Kasperski and all of them, operate update systems in this sensible way. Only Microsoft tries to use it as cover for one of its tools effectively taking ownership of your device.   Please also note that in their response MS acknowledges that Edge is in development. Given that fact it is offensive that customers are unable to remove it from their systems.",US

It was advertised as of a certain specification, and suitable for upgrade to Windows 10.   When it arrived it transpired it was of a lower specification than advertised.   I tried to upgrade it to Windows 10 and failed.   I called Microsoft customer service and was staggered by their rudeness and ineptitude. One ""manager"" in particular, Jonathan Fleischmann, was especially rude, and especially inept.   It would take too long to list the failings of Jonathan Fleishmann and his colleagues at Microsoft, but in summary I was laughed at for thinking the laptop could run Windows 10 despite pointing out that Microsoft's own store website advertised it as such, I was given a massive run-around whilst trying to solve the problem (being asked to call telephone numbers in the USA despite living in the UK for example), and found that Microsoft (which calls itself a ""multinational technology company"") cannot be contacted by email.   Dealing with the company felt like banging one's head against a huge, very stupid, very condescending brick wall, and it became clear that Microsoft really do not care about their customers in the slightest.   All in all, my experience of Microsoft left me incredulous - I cannot believe a company still exists that has such backward customer service, especially one this size. I cannot imagine it will last for much longer without massive massive change.   EDIT: In response to Microsoft's reply below - Look at the top of the page - this is for reviews of Microsoft.com. That you have registered that microsoft.com is based in Denmark is Microsoft's mistake, not mine.   And telling me to go somewhere else for advice is either dumb, deceitful, or both. As you'd see, had you read the review, I've made contact with Microsoft on a number of occasions and everyone I've dealt with has been uniformly useless.   EDIT: I see now that they've changed the name of the company associated with the website address ""microsoft.com"" from ""Microsoft"" to ""Microsoft Danmark"".   So typical of Microsoft - rather than address their failings, they just make it harder for people to highlight how rubbish they are.",GB

Screen suffered from some lighting bleed, the machine was badly overheating and it was running very slow.   After a short chat with their customer services I decided to send the machine in for a repair.  And this is when the trouble started!!!!!!!   Microsoft were not updating me on the status of my repair, their support staff could not tell me what was happening and on many occasions have given me false information. After complaining I received an email from UPS that the package was sent. Four days later I receive my machine back.   The machine I sent back was not inspected and, worst of all, it had a massive crack on the screen. Looking at the package it was obvious that the machine was badly packaged. It was sent in a padded enveloped and stuffed inside a weak box that had no protection.    It is very careless of them as not only did they not repair my machine they were now responsible for actually damaging it even more, rendering it completely useless. So, I complained via email, via their chart function, via phone and it was leading nowhere. Their staff showed very bad attitude which was rather shocking. Finally one of their chat support staff told me that within 24 hours someone will contact me with some resolution. Two hours later I received shipping labels and nothing else. I was not sure what was happening so I called their support line. This member of staff called “Nathan” had no idea what was happening and was struggling to find me on their system. Some time later he does find me and when I asked him who sent the labels and when will I hear back from the escalation team regarding my issues.  He said he was not sure and that I should send me broken Surface back then. I asked about my complaint and he then said that because I received the shipping labels this was it. Everything has been resolved. I then asked to speak to his manager and he then told me that his manager would not want to speak to me as this issue has been resolved. The man was very rude and at the end I had to stop the conversation. So at the end of all this Microsoft has left me at the considerate loss and has demonstrated unacceptable customer service.    Going forward I will not be buying anything off these people again and will now sadly have to consider buying Apple products.   AVOID THEM   I will update this review as things happen.    Update - 24/11/2015    Today I confronted their chat reps about what their colleague told me the day before.

He told me that there was no way for them to know when this will be sorted out. So in essence they lied again.   Update - 27/11/2015    Yesterday I finally spoke to someone from Microsoft. A very polite man who promised to get back to me today, after he looks into the case. At around 2 in the morning I received an email from Microsoft telling me that they are posting me my SP3 machine back.

After waiting a solid 6 weeks for the silly ""Get Windows 10"" to decide they were ready, I just downloaded the upgrade directly from the microsoft website.   I wanted to do a clean fresh install of Windows 10, however you MUST upgrade first before doing a clean install.  I followed these instructions, upgraded to 10 and made sure it was activated.  I then formatted my computer and did a fresh install of Windows 10... which wouldn't activate.   After a little internet research, some people say the system would auto activate after 24-48 hours.  No Luck. Windows 10 treats itself as an OEM install - as long as you have a valid activated copy of 7, 8 or 8.1, you can upgrade to 10 and it will give your computer a generic activation key that is actually generated by the unique hardware (motherboard, harddrive, etc) that your computer contains.   After the clean install, I had the error code 0xc004c003 which means the system wouldn't accept the key that windows 10 GAVE ITSELF after upgrading.  I followed all the steps as required on the Microsoft website.   With a sinking feeling, I decided to contact microsoft tech support directly.  I explained my problem and they immediately transferred me over to the activation specialists (... or whatever they're called.)  Sounds like this is a common problem.   Explained the issue to the second tech, and he requested remote access to my computer.  I granted the request - research had said this was the most common way to get activation issues dealt with.   After about 20 mins of what seemed like nothing happening (occasional mouse movements, but obviously he was doing something on the back end that I couldn't see) he added a second tech to the remote control.  They quickly changed the product key and boom, activated, no problem.   I was expecting a horror story of being told to roll back to 8.1 and then do a clean install all over again, but 25 mins out of my day and they had it fixed without any arguments or questions.   That was a pleasant surprise, and I would say that although it seemed like they weren't doing anything for a long time, it worked out and I am happy.  Yes, the waiting around with no apparent work on my machine was disconcerting (did we lose connection? did they forget about me?), but a little bit of patience was worth it.",CA

The only issue arose during last winter (2013/14) when, due to the fact that one of the windows had been fitted 'back to front' to suit my design needs, rainwater built up in the drainage channel and subsequently caused minor water ingress into the property. This should have been picked up at the survey/fitting stage as it was promptly resolved by TVW by drilling a couple of unobtrusive holes in the drainage channel to allow the water to escape. Their response to the problem was immediate given that it was Xmas/NY and I have found them to offer an excellent after sales service via  Mr Paul Westcott.

288,www.microsoft.com,2014-12-27T19:59:48.000Z,1,Køb aldrig noget fra Microsoft på nettet. Her kan i læse hvorfor.,"23.12.2014 **************** opdatering I sagen ************************   En tur til Sverige, tilbage til Danmark, til Sverige igen og så tilbage til Danmark.  Nu har Microsoft endelig fundet ud af jeg har handlet med dem på internettet efter 6 måneder i karrusellen. Mit køb af en vare jeg aldrig fik er endelig refunderet.    Det er faktisk synd at Microsoft har mistet kontakten til deres kunder. Men det hele skal jo også være Cloud baseret i dag!!!!!   Gid man kunne få lov til at rydde op I den rode butik, så ville de arrogante medarbejdere (gælder langt fra alle) måske få armene ned igen når de stempler ind på arbejdsformidlingen.         ****************************************************************   26.11.2014.    Som I kan se har Microsoft valgt ikke at svare på denne anmeldelse hvorfor de snyder folk på nettet. Håber det giver stof til eftertanke til jer der overvejer at handle med Microsoft på nettet. Nu er det 3 en halv måned siden jeg blev lovet mine penge retur men intet er sket.   ************ oprindelig anmeldelse ******************************   Den 13. August købte jeg en Office 365 Professional for at test noget for mit firma. Desværre kunne denne pakke ikke bruges, da der faktisk på dette tidspunkt ikke findes en OneDrive Android app til Office 365 Professional. For at finde ud af dette røg jeg rundt i hele verden for at ende op i Irland hos Microsoft support. Her beklager Microsoft og lukker min Office 365 Professional konto samme dag og lover mig selvfølgelig pengene retur. Deres supporter kan direkte se min betaling på Microsoft Store så ikke noget problem der. Jeg køber så samme dag en Office 365 Home som rent faktisk sjov nok har en Android app til OneDrive. Ja OneDrive og OneDrive for Buisness er 2 vidst forskellige ting og er på ingen måde kompatible. Nå men ingen skade sket jeg får jo pengene retur fra Microsoft, der er jo et stort firma man kan stole på, specielt når man har det på skrift!!!! Jeg er jo en tålmodig mand så jeg venter 30 dage på at få pengene retur. Men de kommer ikke retur. Jeg skriver så den 18.09.2014 en e-mail til den sammen supporter i Irland hvad der er sket med min tilbageførelse af mine penge. Den 23.09.2014 modtager jeg svar tilbage at der kan gå 60 dage før pengene er retur på min konto. Jeg venter igen tålmodigt og skriver til den samme supporter 1.10.2014 at jeg stadigvæk ikke har modtaget mine penge. Og nu bliver det hele rigtigt spændende. Den 13.10.2014 modtager jeg mail fra sammen person fra Microsoft, at mit produkt slet ikke er købt hos Microsoft men hos en tredjeparts forhandler og at de derfor ikke kan refunderer mit køb. Se nu er vi så ude i ren svindel og bedrageri. Manden har selv set at jeg har købt produktet på Microsoft Store via min Microsoft konto og selv forestået lukning af konto. Ydermere fortæller han i e-mail at han har forsøgt at få fat i mig telefonisk (løgn og latin igen). Nå men det kunne jo være at den pågældende Microsoft supporter havde været ude for en hjerneblødning og fuldstændig glemt alt tidligere e-mail og telefon kontakt.  Så af denne årsag fremsender jeg pr. email samme dag den 13.10.2014 min faktura fra Microsoft Store. 23.10.2014 er en del af den pågældende supporters hjerneceller (nok pga. af vores e-mail korrespondance) kommet tilbage, og jeg får en e-mail at de er villige til at lave en refusion hvis jeg henvender mig til Microsoft i Danmark. Se det er jo rigtigt flot og stort af Microsoft, at de nu vil returnerer et produkt jeg aldrig har brugt og ikke kan bruge da det blev lukket samme dag jeg fik lovet min refusion (90 dage siden). Jeg skriver e-mail retur 23.10.2014 at jeg nok syntes Microsoft internt skulle sørge for mine penge retur, så jeg ikke skulle bruge endnu 90 dage på at sætte Microsoft i Danmark ind i sagen. Det var jo dem der oprindeligt kastede mig til Irland. Nu har vi 10.11.2014 og jeg har intet hørt fra Microsoft.   Nedenstående vedhæftet e-mail korrespondance imellem Microsoft og mig:   Microsoft 13.08.2014 :   Dear  [navn fjernet], Thank you for your call. With regards to our telephone conversation, I have now cancelled your Small Business premium subscription as per your request. Sorry about the trouble trying to find your domain, however this was in part due to the fact the subscription was bought today. If you require this activating again, then please reply to my email. If you would like further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us. Kind regards [navn fjernet] Your Microsoft Business Customer Support  On behalf of Microsoft Ireland Operations Ltd A company incorporated and registered in Ireland number 256796. Registered office 70 Sir John Rogerson's Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland     Mig 13.10.2014     Hi [navn fjernet], Thanks a lot for your efforts. In fact the purchase was a test for our entire organization, and it turned out pretty bad ( sorry for that) It really seems, and that is so confusing, that OneDrive is not really OneDrive. There is OneDrive business and OneDrive and these solution needs to be supported by 2 totally different applications on mobile apps. To support OneDrive business you need to download Office Mobile and for OneDrive you need to download OneDrive. OneDrive App do not support OneDrive Business. It is really mega confusing. We would really like to use Office 365 but we have no idea how to get OneDrive. Is oneDrive really only working on Android with Office Home edition?? Please look here : community.office365.com/en-us/f/173/t/226731 This was exactly the same problem we had. Can you guide us to a person that can help us? Thanks beforehand.       Mig 18.09.2014   Hi [navn fjernet], Now it is more than month ago, I cancelled this purchase, but still you did not transfer my money back to my account. As you can see on my account and as we can see in the bank the 1139 DKKR is not transferred back   Microsoft 23.09.2014   Dear Mr Dan Thank you for your email. Credit that is refunded can take up to 60 days to be returned to the customer. If you have not heard something by the end of the month please let me know and I can ask the billing team to look into this for you. Unfortunately I cannot do anything sooner. If you require more information then please do not hesitate to contact us. Regards [navn fjernet] Your Microsoft Business Customer Support  On behalf of Microsoft Ireland Operations Ltd A company incorporated and registered in Ireland number 256796. Registered office 70 Sir John Rogerson's Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland   Mig 23.09.2014     Thanks [navn fjernet], I will wait and hopefully all will be ok, Mig 01.10.2014 Hi [navn fjernet], I have still no money on my account, could you please check what is going on here. Thanks beforehand.     Microsoft den 13.10.2014   Dear  [navn fjernet], Good afternoon. I have tried to contact you by phone however you must be out of service as I was not able to contact you. With regards to the problem you was having. I raised an escalation as to why you had not received your refund and the answer I got back was that the Small Business premium subscription you bought was a pre-paid key and not by credit card from our Office.Microsoft.com webpage. Because this is a pre-paid key, Microsoft does not offer refunds for pre-paid cards. The card also does not come from Microsoft directly but comes from a third party company and in that instance they should have been contacted as they would have been the only ones who can offer a refund. When I asked how this was bought and was told credit card from our store, this is why I mentioned in the email that credit card refunds can take up to 60 days to be returned to the customer. Unfortunately because this was a pre-paid key, there will be no refund from Microsoft directly.   Regards [navn fjernet] Your Microsoft Business Customer Support  On behalf of Microsoft Ireland Operations Ltd A company incorporated and registered in Ireland number 256796. Registered office 70 Sir John Rogerson's Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland     Mig den 13.10.2014   Hi [navn fjernet], First of all it is directly incorrect that you tried to contact me directly phone number. My direct number is +4522XXXXX and nobody from Microsoft have tried to contact me today or the last 60 days. Second is not correct that I purchased indirectly this service.  It was paid directly using my VISA card on Microsoft homepage using this link : microsoftstore.com/store/mseea/da_DK/pdp/Office-365-Small-Business-Premium/productID.274819200 You help me to close the account directly and you are fully aware this service was never used. Furthermore I purchased a different Office package the same day, because Microsoft promised to give me refund on the incorrect purchase. Now Microsoft have been dragging me around for nearly 90 days and you come up with this. Additionally on our bank account the transaction is also made with Microsoft. Attached you will also find the invoice confirmation sent from Microsoft from my purchase. If I don’t have any news from you within 3 business days I will sent this to my bank as internet fraud, and connect the Danish consumer protection program on this topic with all documentation and email from our conversations and invoices. I was not expecting this from Microsoft.     Microsoft den 23.10.2014   Dear  [navn fjernet], I have spoken with my tier two team and I can provide you the number of the Danish Microsoft Store. This department can refund you as the license comes from the Microsoft Store. Normally we do not issue refunds for Pre-Paid keys however due to the circumstances surrounding this case; they should issue you a refund.   Regards [navn fjernet] Your Microsoft Business Customer Support  On behalf of Microsoft Ireland Operations Ltd A company incorporated and registered in Ireland number 256796. Registered office 70 Sir John Rogerson's Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland   Mig den 23.10.2014   Hi [navn fjernet], In case they should make the refund, then please forward the complete topic to the Danish Microsoft Store, You claimed I did not make the purchase directly with Microsoft. I sent you proof that I did make the purchase directly with Microsoft. You guaranteed that I would get the refund and for this reason I purchased the correct product for my needs. Could you please be so kind and service minded to forward the entire topic to the correct people within your own organization. Thanks beforehand.",DK

WHY they have ROBBED me of £25 for  an upgrade that simply WONT install. I had a working version of 7 and thought that since Windows 8 is on offer until 31st Jan it  would be worth upgrading. It is SUPPOSED to upgrade Windows 7 with  installed software, personal files etc. After trying 2 or 3 times wasting goodness knows how much time what is the end result. A cryptic message saying it cant (wont) install so going back to Windows 7 . It would probably install over Windows 7 if you have absolutely no other programs installed so whats the point?    It is an absolute total utter waste of time and money  It is badly thought out, badly written and joins the ranks of Windows ME & Vista to vie for the title of the worst Windows version.  I have never liked Apple products but now maybe this experience has got me thinking maybe Apple isn't so bad after all.  I thought I would  NEVER  ever go the Apple route but this experience now is pushing me in that direction. Will I get my money back from Microsoft?   i doubt it even though this product is simply not fit for purpose.  Will I trust Microsoft again  - they will have a hard job to convince me they are now worth sending a penny more on their products.  i really think this is the beginning of the end for them. Its going to be downhill from here The only way now seems to be (if I decide to try again) is to do a clean install and waste time having to re-install every program again..

Sure, I can pay an arm and a leg to get their “help” but get this: Only if I had bought their products separately from the laptop.  Because apparently the programs your expensive computer came with doesn’t count at all? So as always, my conclusion when dealing with Microsoft boils down to this: The people they have working for them actually don’t need to use their own products for their work.

They provide products that have too many bugs in them that they have to fix, but remember, we have to pay for the product to begin with and then we have to also pay for the fix for the bugs in the products they sell.   And for such a leading edge company, why do they continue to lag behind the competition?   This company practically invented/created everything we use today in the computing world, so why are they such a sucky company?   Customer service is lousy, products never meet expectations.

324,www.microsoft.com,2012-04-27T15:10:40.000Z,1,Microsoft betrayed small business users!,"I'm a fan of Microsoft, I even own a small bit of stock. I've usually been impressed with its products. The greatest example of this was the Office Live for Small Business product. OLSB provided an easy Website development tool and customer support to assist in developing our Website. And everything was free, including hosting! What a great small business service!   Earlier this year, Microsoft announced the end of OLSB. Instead, small business customers needed to convert to Office 365. The new product has great potential, but the monthly cost was far from free and 2012 budgets had been set months earlier expecting the no cost OLSB service to contine. The new product also required the conversion of our Web site to new software. And the length of time from the notice to cancellation of all OLSB services was less than six months.    I understand that times change and nothing can remain free forever, but Microsoft's treatment of small business customers, and our company in particular, was inexcusable and, for now at least, unforgivable.    Microsoft 365 is a gigantic product with unbelievable capabilities. I looked over the details and couldn't wait to get started. Our company has staff in Africa as well as in the US. Finally, a chance to keep everyone on the same page. But there was a problem: where OLSB was incredibly customer friendly for small businesses with no IT personnel, this time Microsoft provided me with a consultant to help with the changeover. The consultant was incredibly nice and helpful to the extent he could be, but he charged $45 an hour for conversion work. His estimate to convert our site, a very simple site with fewer than 10 total pages, was almost 20 hours! He would have been well worth it, no doubt, but a struggling small business in this economic climate doesn't have that kind of money.   So here I go, working through Microsoft's handy self-conversion documents. Initial setup was easy if one followed the steps very carefully, until I reached the actual Web site. My OLSB website wouldn't convert to the new system. I had to rewrite everything in SharePoint 2010. This is supposed to be an easy to use product for those who lack HTML and CSS skills. I'm certainly one of those, and I found the conversion within the time allowed by Microsoft before my site disappeared, impossible.   After several very frustrating weeks which included the purchase of books and online training, I gave up. I simply didn't have the time to learn SharePoint, and we lacked the funds to have the site converted for us. I decided, very reluctantly, to give up my plans for intercontinental cooperation via Office 365. I decided to move to a new host.   The Microsoft personnel I dealt with in the early stages of canceling were very nice, though no one could actually help me with the process of canceling and moving my domain name. That was always someone else's job. It took four calls to reach the actual tech support person I needed. This associate was not helpful. He spoke to me in terms I didn't understand and he became frustrated when I asked for clarification. Finally, he sent me to the OLSB customer support area. When I got there, I found most of the links had been deactivated. There was no phone number for customer support, and the email support option also led to a ""page not found"" message.    I finally found a site after stumbling through help sites on the Web and within Microsoft. Once I found the instructions, the cancel and move process was clearly explained and didn't require a lot of thought or effort. If only someone had taken time to give me directions to the OLSB cancellation site on my very first call!   I read another frustrated small business owner's comments on another web site. The owner, whose experience with Microsoft sounded very similar to mine, complained that Microsoft made it very easy to sign up with them, but almost impossible to leave!   I'm extremely disappointed in Microsoft. Although always overpriced and less than attentive to the huge variety of needs of small businesses, I've never experienced this kind of uncaring from this company. Obviously, I won't be using Office 365. I hope to lessen our dependence on Microsoft wherever possible. And I'm looking very hard at my stock portfolio. Customer service is important to me, and I'm also not sure I want to own part of a company that has totally lost touch with a key part of its future market.",US
