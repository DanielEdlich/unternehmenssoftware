They are very forgiving on late renewals (sshhh, don't tell anyone).  Their pricing is 100% straightforward with zero gimmicks.  Plus, they do not spam you with upsells and offers.  If you have been abused at the hands of some of the major Domain Registrars, you know exactly what I am talking about.  Move your domains here now! The user interface is extremely easy to use. The only downside I see is, they do not allow teams to manage the account (e.g. one person handles technical, another billing / registration, etc.), so either the account gets shared (and you synch the 2FA with the appropriate authenticator), or it is a one-man show. Also, there is no reseller support, but with retail prices this low, it's hard to see how a reseller would fit in except as value add. I recommend Porkbun to all my clients.",US

Overall, my experience so far with Porkbun has been flawless.  Philip assisted me through the entire process of moving over my company's website to Porkbun. He also helped optimize my site so that it would load faster. Our site now loads in under 2 seconds. (For context, when our site was hosted by Bluehost, it took about 10-15 seconds to load, and that was with all their optimization that they charged us extra for). I have also experienced zero down periods for my site with Porkbun. With Bluehost, my website would be offline for an average of 1 hour per day for reasons Bluehost was never able to explain. None of these issues exist for us with Porkbun.  Beyond offering great hosting and customer service, I must also point out how much I enjoy their newsletters. I know it's a silly thing to comment on, but each newsletter includes an original graphic and pun that genuinely makes me laugh.

Yesterday I had a mail to say they hadn't heard back and the account was at risk of suspension. Again, I've no problem with that and immediately mailed back to say it had in fact been completed. Today I've gone to register more domains for my clients and received a message to say the account was now suspended. No investigation or mails to me to say it hadn't actually been received - just a straight suspension of the profile.  To treat a client who has put through so much business this way is beyond belief. I'm hoping that this piece of feedback may speed up a response to the 2 mails that I'm yet to hear back on...

There are plenty of processors making a conversion to USD for a very low fee if they don't want to take any change/volatility risk. This isn't a good excuse. I bet Coinbase, they are currently using, can very well do it. If there is a small % charge for customers, why not, but 10% is too much here. I do hope this will be changed in the future.",CH

However the way they handle abuse complaints is not good (At least it wasn't in the past but I am unsure of current business practises).  While I am not sure if it is still in practice, Porkbun would suspend your domain without contacting you first if they receive an automated Google safe search warning regarding the domain.  This happened to me in the past where google detected a false positive and Porkbun suspended the domain. It was clearly a false positive since I didn't modify the website whatsoever and submitted it back to google and it was approved as being clean with nothing wrong; this took maybe a few hours to 1 day for google to verify.  Porkbun left the domain suspended for days and wasn't very informative at the time because it was the weekend and abuse department was only monday to friday. This I found to just be a terrible business practise, i understand the need to remove abuse but the steps in place at the time of it happening to me need to be changed as it seems like there was no human intervention or double check and my domain was disabled just because of an automated google warning.  This isn't the first time this has happened either, you can lookup Porkbun domain suspended / suspension topics on forums such as LowEndTalk, Reddit, etc...",CA

Not only that, we had a few snagging issues when we first signed up (as we signed up when they first started offering .uk domains - and we're in the UK), and they resolved the issues within minutes, not days/weeks. I always give it a little while before writing reviews, as I know that many companies offer a great service to begin with, then it deteriorates... but with Porkbun we have been consistently impressed. Their support team not only resolves issues, but also has a great chat with you and you know you're actually talking to a real human unlike with some companies where their staff are told to be robotic. The service, prices, and support is outstanding, and I'd give more stars if I could. Check them out, you can tell they're a company with a lot of ambition - they're constantly improving - and even better, their recent nameserver change had ZERO downtime for us, AND offers more features. Really happy with the overall experience and providing they keep up their amazing level of service, I'll continue using them for life.",GB

Great for developers and your everyday person.,"I have 5 domains through porkbun and have used their hosting for both myself and clients, I have for multiple years. I've never had any issues. Support replies next day and helps me fix whatever I did wrong within US standard office hours in my experience (as they are actually a smaller business I'm happy to trade crappy 24/7 support with long hold times in favor of quality next day email support). Things are easy to setup, prices are not marked up (I find domains are the same price or cheaper than namecheap even).  SSL certificates are not an upcharge and done through Let's Encrypt automatically for you. ""WhoIs Privacy"" is not an upcharge either. In my opinion, this is how all registrars should do things.. Hosting is all reasonable, there's a basic and well priced managed wordpress plan and a basic site builder hosting plan for those less tech savy, as well as a basic static hosting plan, a full CPANEL, and even a basic PHP hosting plan for more tech savy folks. They're all pretty cheap and work great for small and medium sized businesses! It ticks me off when companies overcharge for wordpress hosting, it's predatory in my opinion, so porkbun not doing this is important to me even though I don't personally use it. Overall I see myself using porkbun for domains for as long as I buy domains. For hosting I'll admit I'm moving to hosting things myself on a digital ocean VM, but that's only because I'm lucky to have the skillset to. For those who don't I tell them to use porkbun's hosting plans.",US

493,www.porkbun.com,2022-10-20T02:13:34.000Z,5,A company you'll love,"I have been a customer for 3 years, since 2020. Porkbun is nothing short of pleasant surprises. It's been a long time since I gave them a review, so I decided to write a new one to reflect my up-to-date experience. I decided to move from Gandi since the price was just not affordable in 2020 December. Then I found a peculiar name: Porkbun. People has been saying all the nice words about this company, and skimming through their company's homepage, I decided to jump ship. And it proved a correct choice. Price-wise, Porkbun does not always offer the best price for some domains. But they are open about it and offers a comparison to their major competitors. I recommend checking out Google Domains and Cloudflare Registrar if they are available in your country, since these two usually offer best prices along with Porkbun. Porkbun also offer web hosting. As with most experienced web masters, I do not recommend putting all the eggs in one bucket. There are other hosts that offer more competitive prices, more generous limits, or more features. But if you absolutely do not want to figure out these yourself, Porkbun's hosting services aren't bad. The only complaint I have is that the ads for the free WordPress and free static page offers are too big—but since it's free, I won't complain too much. For stability, I experienced very little downtime since 2020. The most noticeable one was when they were DDoS'd, I don't blame them. The stability of the DNS servers and the website has always been great otherwise. Porkbun offers TOTP and U2F keys for 2FA. This is a huge plus for me, since this means a more secure account. And a more secure account makes a happier customer. I didn't have much need for customer support, but they reply fairly quick, often within 1 to 2 business days. See other reviews for more in-depth customer support experience. Overall, Porkbun has been a great registrar for 3 straight years, and I sincerely hope they keep at it, refrain from being customer hostile like a certain company with Go and D in their name. I just want more merch, like tote bags, webcam cover, or umbrellas maybe?",HK

Love the free privacy, free DNS, free forwarding etc. Have not tried any of the free hosting. The only minor exceptions I have are that they lack some accessibility awareness and their domain management interface is a bit clunky for people that own many (as in hundreds) of domains. SPECIFICS: -- Accessibility: Poor contrast text on pages, and text that is too small or too thin. No dark mode. Some confusing navigation or unexpected actions. -- Browser back button: pages often lack a back button, or if they do have backward navigation, search results on the previous page(s) are lost, requiring a new search, cumbersome for incremental changes --- So for instance, if you go in to set a certificate or some other ""next page"" you lose you place, lose search results, lose where you were at, etc. - ORGANIZING -- No folders for organizing domains. The tag/label system is semi-useful, but incomplete. --- The domain search field is called ""filter"", requires a click to activate (preferentially it'd be an open field like the ""REGISTER A NEW DOMAIN"" field.  --- The search ""filter"" destroys any other filters set. --- It would be great if regex type searches could be done. --- It would be great if some searches could be saved as hot keys or custom menu items. - LABELS -- Not enough colors, no custom colors -- Can not sort by label --- Can not change order of labels in master list, which is a problem because the order shown on the domain is the order of the labels in the list. - API and CSV FILES -- No way to upload CSV files to set parameters or options of domains. -- Free API access is a great for setting DNS records. Hopefully they will add features such as mail forwarding, domainer/afternic, pricing, labels, etc. which would cover the reasons I need to upload CSV files. ------- It should be noted that a lot of what I mention is specific to the needs of someone with hundreds of domains, and otherwise are my wish list of features, and I don't want to take away from the otherwise good service and support here.",US

Cheap means bad service. I had two abusive experiences with them and decided to move away to a more responsible registrar. First I experienced issues with their interface while updating my glue records as regardless of what I pasted there they would not update correctly. I deleted the glue to re-create them correctly as it seemed the only way to do this. Well it turns out that if you do that, Porkbun has configured their systems to reset your nameservers on ALL domains hosted with Porkbun that used the affected glue records to some random Porkbun nameservers, completely ignoring SOA TTL. This is technical sabotage and incompetence at the highest level. The second really bad experience occurred today when overnight, after receiving a supposed phishing report they nullrouted the main domain that was hosting the nameservers and took down over 200 websites. There was no abuse notice, no warning whatsoever, no email with the report that they received and no possibility to get the domain unsuspended unless I waited until it was morning and their abuse staff woke up to resolve this issue. Typical abuse notices go to hosting level first and if ignored they go to registrar and there was no notice at hosting level whatsoever. Also, the fact that they suspend you and go to sleep without giving you an option to confirm that you received the abuse report, you have fixed the issue and activate the domain back automatically is mind-blowing. Their staff is educated and courteous, but their policies are abusive to say the least. Moreover, their lack of transparency is even more concerning, hence the reason for which I am moving away from them. P.S. Do not trust most reviews you read here because they are from people owning one or two domains that are happy, not by people owning hundreds of domains. P.P.S.

Not sure how company received high ratings on trustpilot, but suspect foul play. No reason to go to this company to have it as registrar for 1 year because renewals are expensive. ANSWER TO VENDOR REPLY: It still does not change the fact that you employ dirty advertisement tactics. Your company is listed on multiple ""registrar ranking sites"", known to take money  for the place in list. It can be easily googled, and you will see different heavily discounted rates with different types of registration of different tlds. But discounts do not exist, certainly you will say it's outdated information. But on so many sites? Regardless of your denial of involvement in advertising on ranking sites, this benefits only you.

After reading glowing reviews, Porkbun had me sold, I was just about to transfer all my domains to Porkbun, but when I happen to discover that catch-all email forwarding was not provided I stopped. Catch-all forwarding is a very important facility that most email users would find useful and many power users will eventually require. Porkbun's excuse is that is stresses their servers, so I was reluctant to believe that. I've had no problem with previous registrars, and I've managed to stop spam after it arises. It's a lot of hassle setting up email address and preventing spam without a catch-all forwarding facility. Porkbun's solution is to disable that altogether, for the benefit of their own servers, which makes me think they don't have very good infrastructure, or are on the cheap with low grade AWS hosting. Really, their reason for not offering catch-all's is lame and i transferred my domains elswhere. One thing I am upset about is that Porkbun never makes it clear on their promotionals or signup pages that catch-all is not provided, I had to find out from Reddit forums. Gotta love reddit.",AU

843,www.porkbun.com,2022-08-23T23:41:35.000Z,5,Best. Registrar. Ever. (They're kind of a pig deal.),"I've been a full-time commercial web software engineer since 1996. I own 42 domains. 36 are with PorkBun (38 as soon as they're eligible for transfer. The other 4  have to remain where they are; since Porkbun doesn't support .si or .do CCTLDs, or they'd be there too). I have owned northwards of 100, and have sold single names replete with brand identity and logo for enough to pay for the full 100, too. I know of whence I speak. Let me be very clear: Porkbun is, without question, the best registrar online today, in terms of price, selection, amazing support staff, ease of DNS and *RECORD management... hell, even their search is in the top three (and I say that as one who's been contracted to WRITE one before. FOR a registrar. That's right: I used the 'bun even when I was EMPLOYED BY A COMPETITOR). I LOVE this registrar. Once you're over being done dirty by GoDaddy, getting screwed by NameCheap, dealing with the hassles surrounding Netim or OVH, getting a domain stolen from underneath you at CrazyDomains (ALL of which I've done/had happen) I sincerely hope you recall this review. You can thank me then. Update: Just noticed I'm up into the mid-50's (like that AND like that, alas) and wanted to reiterate: Still, without question, beyond a shadow of a doubt, HAM'S DOWN, one of my favorite companies to interact with, registrar or otherwise. Yanno when you talk to an employee of some org and they're just grinning like a loon the whole time? Just bloody delighted to be doing whatever task others call ""work"" (and they call ""pork"")?  Every time I deal with their support team I think to myself, ""wow. What do they know that I don't? Maybe I'm in the wrong industry."" Dunno. They just give off that vibe... the one Google used to, back when their motto was still, ""don't be evil."" For ongoing services or ad ""hock"" ones, I'm a lifer.",US

Website returned 403 Forbidden. Emailed support, they responded very quickly, told me it could be related to my VPN and that I should tell them my IP address so they can ""investigate further"". After I disclosed my IP address they ghosted me! I send them another email the next day but they didn't answer again. Very unprofessional! I managed to successfully create an account after three days from another computer at home. I think I got the reason why it wasn't working in the first place: It was because of the password which contained Extended ASCII characters! At least give the user a message that they should pick a password without them instead of just throwing ""403 Forbidden"" on a blank page! But it doesn't end here. After I purchased my domain for two years I logged out for a while and then tried to log back in. Password didn't work! My intuition tells me it's because it starts with a single quotation mark (it was generated randomly by the password manager). Not even regular ASCII is handled properly in the backend! I did manage to change my password and it went ok from there on, but it took me 3 days of tinkering just to register an account. You shouldn't need to pick a simpler (and thus more crackable) password just to please a dysfunctional form backend. Other bad things: The website is mess. The ""Contact Us"" link in the footer is just a blank javascript. That's just laughable (in a sad way). Good things: Although they ditched me after a short correspondence, the initial response was pretty quick. Sadly, this and the competitive pricing are pretty much the only good things about Porkbun. It does have a lot of potential but I'm going to rate it for what it is and not for what it could be. Honestly the review should've been one star but I'm trying as hard as I can to be objective.",RO

You As I said, I’ve done it before. But is still not working. Can you fix it for me, please? Eddie Unfortunately it's not created correctly, you need to create it again but making sure that. checkbox is checked so that it will work on any subdomains You Please kindly create it for me. Thanks. You If I do that, the images don’t load. Eddie The images don't load? You Yes if I do as you say, it doesn’t load images. That’s why please kindly assist and try to fix it. Thanks Eddie What images are you referring to? I'm not understanding. You Website images Eddie The URL forwarder shouldn't have any impact on your website's images, you'll just want to recreate the URL forwarder and make sure that box is checked so that any subdomains will forward on as well as the root domain You Please see my You my above replies, you’ll see that I’ve done that but the website images don’t load in that case. Kindly fix the issues for me. Thank you. Eddie Again, the forwarder doesn't have any control over what is loaded at the destination URL. The issue is you do not have Wildcard forwarding enabled for the forwarder you setup, you just need to recreate it and then it will load correctly for WWW so long as you check the ""Use wildcard URL forwarding"" option as I have said above You Again, I’ve done that before and it impacts on the images not being displayed. Eddie Unfortunately you will need to do it again Eddie If you setup the URL forwarder again, making sure the ""use wildcard"" option is checked, it will probably forward for your www subdomain and any other subdomains You Unfortunately, I have already said, I’ve done that and it doesn’t load the images. Eddie I'm not seeing that you've recreated the forward, please try recreating the forward as I have instructed You Please read my historical replies above ⏏️ Eddie ended the chat Review edit: Thank you for your reply. We find part of your reply as a weak excuse. The employee with highest reviews should be monitored more. Also, it’s not just about us, make sure at all times Eddie is performing to highest standards.

I did not have to go through 3 or 4 page loads (of which Namecheap's page loading is significantly slower than when I first started renting/buying domain names from them) as it is available all in one page of Porkbun.

I received confirmation that the purchase was successful and that I am the owner of the domain. So I ordered a design and website from a development company for about three times the price of the domain. The domain was not displayed in the panel. After a few days I was wondering what was going on and wrote to support and they told me I didn't own the domain and they refunded the money. The refund took a few days. In the end my money disappeared for a week, I had a big loss because Porkbun made me believe I was the domain owner and also I had to pay a cancellation fee to the development company to avoid bigger losses. That way you will burn $ 1500 for nothing. Porkbun themselves only made excuses even when they wrote very clearly that I am the owner and that everything was successful, they reject any responsibility. You can buy domains there, buy a few ... or buy some domains on Porkbun that you don't rely on. If you're doing serious business or relying on a domain, you'd better buy elsewhere. --- Edit: Answer to Porkbun You did not warn at the checkout at the time i purchased the domain.

Pros: Good prices... not always the cheapest, but often are. Support are friendly if not always helpful. Simple control panel that's normally fairly easy to use.  Cons: Control panel is missing a few features I would like to see, I can still do what I want but I have to go about it in a different way. Support: both times I've had problems, my eventual solution has been to use a different company. Make of that what you will.  If you're thinking of using them for your .uk domain, be careful, they've only just started offering them and there are some teething problems. In short even with the domain privacy turned ""off"" (data is redacted in their own Whois, but they're supposed to send the registry your real data), Nominet were not receiving my registrant data, even when I tried to update it on their control panel it just errored. My eventual solution to avoid Nominet's data validation failure/domain revocation was to transfer the domain to another registrar then correct the registrant info. Not ideal. A shame as their renewal price is very competitive and I have half a dozen of the lil .uk guys.  Overall, I think they're pretty good, I think they're trying. They're worth your time if you have other options you can work with too. But as yet I'm not totally prepared to rely on them for all of my domain needs.",GB

That's a long reaction time, but the bigger problem is that there are no updates on the situation.  Normally when a company is quiet during problems, it means that they are going out of business. Which means your URL's can get locked up behind bankruptcy laws! I hastily replaced all DNS servers and was contemplating in panic mode to move the URL's to get out while I could. Finding the replies here on this review site from Porkbun, it looks like there was a DDOS attack. However, DNS servers were not back up worldwide at the time I read those replies. I still don't know if the DDOS attack is over and if their DNS servers are operational again. Their DNS servers are not pingable and they simply don't communicate to their customers. Not on their website, blog, or social media channels. They only replied here on Trustpilot for potential new customers. Existing customers apparently don't matter. EDIT: Thank you for the quick reply. Let's hope communication will be better next time. I had a two providers that went bankrupt in the past and they let you know with absolute silence. Followed by a world of trouble. Therefore communication is crucial. Especially during the outage. I replaced my DNS servers because I didn't know you were working on it and nearly moved the URLs as well.",CH

Their site is straight forward and makes finding domains and alternative TLDs extremely easy. As my domains at a legacy registrar expire, I will be transferring them to Porkbun.",US

During that year I have had ZERO ISSUES. I just logged in to renew after getting a reminder that 2 of my domains were due to expire and I had forgot my password, when I attempted to log in with a wrong password I was notified instantly which made me feel that they take security very seriously which is always a great thing. I proceeded to login after remembering my password and I only wanted to renew one of my domains and remove the other. I was able to complete payment for my renewal and remove the other domain so easily within 5 minutes. They really are such a great domain company with the most competitive prices I have seen. I will recommend to others and continue to use in the future.",GB

The domain was placed on hold by the registry (not Porkbun) for allegedly spamming although this is entirely false and has now been removed from the spam blocklist and re-enabled. Porkbun were never notified of the suspension, which is unusual and it was a manual entry. I would like to thank Phillip from support who apologised for missing my email and then acting as the go-between me and the registry. Previous review 10.08.202: Nice, simple user interface with excellent use of branding however their support leaves a lot to be desired. I initially chose Porkbun because of how positively they were rated and good prices. I bought a .me domain on the 31st of July only to have it go offline sometime overnight on the 7th. I sent an email to support over 24 hours ago and have not received a response back or an answer to my Twitter DM. No acknowledgement, no ""we're looking into it"". Contrast this with my hosting at another company, and they answered me within 20 minutes to say the issue was likely on the registrar's end. Maybe I should have stuck with them for domains too. This is simply unacceptable. I'm very lucky this wasn't for anything major. If it had been a business? Well, I'd have been screwed. I really wish I had something more positive to say. UPDATE: Have now been waiting for over 72 hours. Their website states email turnaround is under 24 hours. This is absolutely unacceptable. Would not trust Porkbun for anything critical that you want 24/7 support for.",GB

Today when i was seeing a video on you tube about porkbun there was a comment that they delete the website even without notifying and still cuts the money for monthly payment for a year if i build with their editor. I dont know if its true.. Becuase i just used it for nearly a month. If anyone of you know he truth then tell me please.

It takes literally one click. They put the button right there. If you turn off the auto-renew on a domain, you don't get bombarded with follow-up emails for months on end. The price for the first year of a domain, particularly non .com domains, are unbeatable. Some just dollars. This combined with the ease of toggling renewal options makes Porkbun the absolute best platform to bulk purchase domains in order to protect options in the case that you haven't decided what to name a business or site.",US

They also offer almost any domain name extension you might want. And they don't jack the price up high for renewals like most domain name registrars. Above all, they don't play games like ionos who adds things you didn't request. They are, hands down, the best company to buy a domain name from.

Their support is utter garbage when you run into any form of difficulties; they will tell you, yes we will get back to you as soon as possible; well that may be shortly before the second coming, and when you finally send in a reminder, they will give you a half-baked response that will never solve your problem. They claim to be one of the cheapest registrars out there, that maybe the case but the savings is not worth it when the pain comes back to bite you when you least expect. The fact that they build their motto around A PIG, should at least tell you something. I usually never one to gripe about poor service providers and I have never written a poor review about any host or registrar but this one has compelled me beyond any reasonable doubt that mediocrity has finally found a home in the pacific northwest of the U.S",ZA

Now my website, which is on a $400 premium domain has been suspended apparently for having a 'fake shop' on it. This is utter rubbish as I am building a new site on it, have taken no orders and cannot take orders. I contacted them to tell them this was a mistake and their support told me they were so sorry and it was a mistake, and they are so sorry etc etc... then I check back 8 days later and the domain has been suspended again... its a poor service and poor standards all round at porkbun.

1757,www.porkbun.com,2020-04-14T14:31:46.000Z,1,Porkbun is terrible,"Porkbun is terrible. I purchased the $12 monthly cPanel monthly plan because I have a custom site using PHP mail. Their description reads: ""If you're looking for a more generic shared hosting plan then cPanel might be for you. While not specifically designed for a particular type of website, it's a good option if you want to install a prebuilt or custom PHP site."" The form wasn't working correctly so I had to pay a developer to try to troubleshoot the problem, only to find out it is a server issue. They have disabled PHP mail. During a live chat session (which was more like ask a question and receive an answer 15 hours later - super helpful when you are paying someone for their time to look into your website bugs!!) the rep said: ""PHP is available on cPanel, but PHP mail is a specific feature we have disabled for security reasons."" Wow! Can you imagine my confusion based on the description of the monthly plan I had JUST purchased saying ""it's a good option if you want to install a prebuilt or custom PHP site."" Nowhere does it say that PHP mail is disabled for security reasons though?  Okay, so the rep suggests using an SMTP plugin to send the mail that way. I asked if he had any suggestions and he did not. Okay, that's fine as well. I shoot a message to the developer WHO I AM PAYING FOR HIS TIME IN ALL OF THIS about what the rep had said using an SMTP plugin. The developer gets back to me after installing the SMTP plugin and says it should be all set. I do the test and sure enough, I am still not receiving the message sent from the contact form! I speak with my developer and he says there is absolutely nothing he can do at this point. He has done thousands of website forms with this exact script. It has been determined once again A SERVER ISSUE. I am so upset at this point as I have wasted DAYS troubleshooting this issue with very little to basically NO HELP whatsoever from pork bun. I have also wasted lots of money paying a developer for something that pork bun falsely advertises. God only knows what their excuse for this issue will be. Either way, I have had a terrible experience with Porkbun and would highly discourage anyone from signing up for any kind of account with this company. Terrible business",US

Customer service is very helpful when you need them. If they are offline, they will get back to you the next morning (in my case) if you used the 'Email Option'. Any and all domains purchased with them are also equipped with Free WHOIS Privacy and SSL cert. which is amazing. But this is where it falls short unfortunately and why it's not exactly 5 stars. Their hosting and email options are good but I wish it would come at a bundle price. Unless I'm missing it, you have to pay for the services individually. I can see that some might want one or the other, but for me, I'd like to have it bundled for simplicity. Please correct me if I'm wrong and there's in fact an option for this. In conclusion, this provider in my opinion is top notch and a fantastic choice when looking for a domain. If you are looking for options to host an email with that domain or make a website, you can but you would need to purchase them on a separate 'plan'.",US

I have tried them all; bought and sold domains with them all, and transferred them into and out of them all for various reasons.   ALL the others have one gotcha or another.  Without exception.  Some with too many gotchas and weird policies to even count.  Like forgetting to tell you they remove domains from your control panel if you decide to delay renewal for a period but still within the grace renewal period. Like making you click on three different boxes or dropdown menus to complete a purchase after they have taken the money from your card or paypal. Like tripling their price after year 1. There are SO many ways every other registrar tries to trip you up. Literally EVERY other Registrar I have used. Porkbun - have NO 'gotchas' that I have found. What is there support like? I have NO IDEA - why - because I have never needed their support as far as I remember! Everything is fast, intuitive, WORKS, and, their policies are really fair and laid out clearly.  Their prices are fabulous, and consistent. Everything they do, is, fabulous, and consistent. I guess I should come off the fence.  They are pretty damn good! (I know - that name. Porkbun.

This is the very first time I have found a trusty Domain Registrar with a very simple and intuitive dashboard from where I can manage every aspect of my domains on my own. I can manage Registrant Contacts, the domains status, the lock/unlock, the auth-code, the whois data, redirects, dns records and DNSSEC with their 4 nameservers or change the authoritative NS and also register my own vanity nameservers GLUE records. I can even insert my 6/8 custom nameservers without being limited in numbers. A pretty thing is that I can organise my domains portfolio with ""labels"".

They are aimed toward a slightly more technical audiance, but with the addition of phone support a while ago and the quick connect feature it's still very useable for very nontechnical people.

If I was going to take a half star off it would be because you need to override their default nameservers when registering a domain name. It would be great to be able to set my own default nameservers in my account for each domain name - thanks for the reply but now I’ll have to dock you in the rating down from 5 as that reply is simply garbage. Changing the name servers AFTER registration creates delays. I’m speaking from first hand experience with multiple domains registered with you. Every single other registrar I’ve dealt with in more than 15 years has allowed this setting to be pre-set upon registration for a deployment, especially in an emergency such as a client having their email server go down and they need a stop-gap domain set up to get. Usiness rnsils running again; making it possible to get up and running sometimes immediately but always within an hour (or 4 with smaller registrars) for a new registration. Even godaddy, which I despise dealing with, allow this. My closing recommendation to you is that, in future, when someone makes a suggestion... don’t just tow the company line and essentially say “deal with it” even in a polite way only helps you seem PC)",AU

More than the great prices, more than the wide selection of TLD's, more than the FAQ/knowledgebase, was the fact that when I called to verify some information before buying, the phone was answered by a REAL HUMAN BEING!  No phone tree, no disgusting hold music.  She answered all my questions (patiently, I might add), even double checking a couple of them to make sure she gave me accurate information.  The whole thing may not work out, who knows?

I was thrilled to try out an affordable alternative to some of the 'big names' but it's left a bad taste in my mouth. Prior to signing up for hosting - I chatted in to get information because their own site was so slow it kept kicking me out and 504'ing. I was assured it was because of how quickly they're growing, and it doesn't impact their hosting at all. Super. Load. Of. Crap. My site's not even done yet, has less than 4 products on it, css is minified, everything is compressed and it is still taking 5 seconds before the FIRST ping! I work on sites daily (SEO) and I have never experienced such a slow site. (Hello, 1997?) I sent it to my web dev and he won't even touch it until I switch hosting providers, because he says there's nothing he can do until I get new hosting (it's not worth it to try, apparently, it's that bad.) When I emailed in today, I was told that the 'hosting isn't for everyone' and is a 'one size fits all.' Uhh. That would have been nice to mention before I bought my 4 domains through PorkBun, especially when I specifically asked. Cannot recommend. And I'm locked into their hosting for 2 months apparently. So I guess I can launch my new site (with the products i've worked tirelessly on for 8 months) in 2 more months... after I switch hosting.

Over half of my domains are at Porkbun.  Serves as prima facie evidence that they are most often the best option...  Their prices are typically among the lowest for new registrations, renewals and transfers (and I do carefully compare, and track down the specials that save money).  Speaking of money... theirs is the most generous policy in regard to expiry that I have ever seen, which allowed me to keep domains I otherwise woulda simply let go.  They offer free Let's Encrypt SSL certificates, and allow full DNS control.  Their Web site is improving constantly, with a good interface for domain management. (Consider the difficulties of having so many domains under one customer's account.)  Their support is excellent; although not available 24/7, they're quick to respond to every issue I have encountered: They are proactive, even aggressive, about security.  They don't support all 1,000+ extensions, and there's those rare domains (< 1%) that can get too tricky to register there (e.g. requiring trademark agreements to be signed, or that weren't meant to be ~;-)  Perfect? Nobody is. But, even being nit-picky? I'd give 'em a 96% overall score... when a domain is valuable, or otherwise important, Porkbun is an excellent choice.",US
