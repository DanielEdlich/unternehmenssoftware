The reason they give NOW .. December 22: Your account has been suspended and will not be restored because it was found to be violating the Twitter Terms of Service, specifically the Twitter Rules against participating in targeted abuse. In order to ensure that people feel safe expressing diverse opinions and beliefs on our platform, we do not tolerate abusive behavior. This includes inciting other people to engage in the targeted harassment of someone.  Now obviously you can see from what I just told you I said verbatim. I was talking to MATT WALSH.

And yet post-Elon Twitter said the EXACT SAME THING VERBATIM that pre-Musk twitter said. Furthermore there was no abuse of the people in question as I do not even know their identities. I am 100% sure that the protesters in question did not see my tweets and nothing I wrote incited anyone to do anything. Again I wrote two things: 1. They should be locked up. The law says that if you disturb the peace, you are committing a crime and will be arrested. The law also says if you endanger someone's health, you are committing a crime and will be arrested. Spitting on someone is endangering their health ESPECIALLY in a world where COVID exists. 2. They should be shot into the sun. An obvious joke. Nobody can shoot anyone into the sun, not even Elon Musk. THEY ARE LYING TO YOU. The reinstatement of people like Trump, Tate, etc. At best this is just because their legions of followers demanded their reinstatement, at worst it's a political theater that they're pretending to be about freedom of speech to SHUT OPPOSITION UP ABOUT IT while they quietly still censor WE THE PEOPLE who very few of us have hundreds of thousands of followers to rally for us.",US

Abuse has become mainstream and hate speech is prominent in this platform. In my opinion, the average IQ of a twitter user today is in the negatives. Say anything and there's always that one group of people who try to cause drama or an argument just for the sake of it. Please, do not use this app, It is NOT worth your time, Reddit was right. this is just a worser version of facebook.

I don't post comments, I just want to review the last dozen or so posts but twitter forces me to log in. Another thing is the blocking of accounts for pathetic reasons. An example is the ""trauma"" of Russian trolls under a post about the encirclement of their troops. Twitter decided that I had hurt the company badly with a post that they had to surrender or be killed.  To unblock the account I had to assign a phone number to the account and delete the post. Eventually, after some thought, I deleted the account. It is possible to live without Twitter, and I will not tolerate pathetic prudery and coercion.",PL

Twitter’s policies are having a hard impact on a lot of people. Famous people have complained of being cut off at the knees because of some perceived crime.  These are frivolous and vexatious accusations that don’t correspond to the reality of life. The system is designed to punish and be unnecessarily aversive in nature.

These trolls - mainly from russia and africa - say the most horrendous things on twitter, and no one bothers them. But if you contest what they say, you are quickly banned. I'm guessing that these trolls have a system of 'mass reporting' anyone who speaks out against russia's warmaking to twitter's moderation system, which automatically reacts with a ban. I've also noticed that these pro-russian trolls tend to 'trap' people by posting tweets and comments that a person who is against russia's war will tend to react to, and then provoking them into making replies that will get them banned. All in all, it results in an online environment that is increasingly pro-russian. But more than this, twitter responds to any reported tweets with 'punishments' - it bans you, for a day, for a few days, for a week. For speaking. It bans you for speaking. I believe that this directly - directly - violates the right to free speech. I have got banned three times, and each time, I did not use abusive language. Moderation was entirely arbitrary, and punishments meted out in an arrogant and dictatorial manner.

However, roll forwards to 2016, and things started to change rather significantly and it has continued to get worse and worse. It has become a platform whereby abuse has become mainstream and conducted by anyone against anybody for any reason. Then there are the troll farms which are created by organizations or even governments to spread information, true or not, and try to sway people when it comes to political discussions. These trolls or bots are usually identifiable as they will have around 8 numbers after their name. Twitter becomes an exercise of locking down your account for a couple of weeks due to the volume of abuse. The abuse is organized as it results in a huge pile on attacks by dozens or hundreds of people with nothing else better to do in their lives. I think the abuse has reached a level where Twitter cannot really do anything about it. A British politician had brought up this matter within a bill proposed to the House of Commons, and then it later transpired that this politician was sending people defamatory accusations and abuse. The problem is endemic. If you do not have a Twitter account, for the love of God, do not sign up. It will wear you down emotionally in the long run.",GB

In their pursuit of accumulating a great spectrum of opinions, Twitter has lost itself and has certainly become a worse aggressive, inhuman hellhole than 4Chan or 9Gag in regards to radical political extremists(left and right), Mob-culture (for mobbing, canceling, doxxing and real life targeting), openly spitting racist phrases (for example the account @justice64772181 tweeted: ""All people that eat meat are pedophiles and should be killed."" ; This account and this Tweet still exist even though Twitter is very well aware of the content - police is already involved and Twitter will be held accountable - and the user doing this every day, so to say, Twitter supports hate speech openly!). Twitter once was a platform for fair, open-speech, reasonable debates...  That's long gone: Harassment, Racism, doxxing, targeting, mobbing, canceling... All of these actions are openly supported by Twitter. Marking tweets as harmful or one of the mentioned above, won't do anything.  Nowadays they are lacking in new features. The only new feature was a monetary add on for influences to earn some more cash, ripping it out of people by tweeting literal nonsense, fake news, steering up hate and such.   The app is a buggy trash app, which should be rated 1-star and deleted from Google-Appstore; Advice to use the desktop app.  Jack and his goons working on the development are basically horrendous when it comes to quality and competence. To sum up, Anything related to Twitter has changed. Aside from the horrendous quality this Sm-platform has provided over the last years, there is really nothing good to mention about this hellhole.  Their stance on human rights, their stance on free speech, their stance on openly supporting radical, aggressive, destructive and criminal organizations",DE

We set up a work account in 2009, back when there was no need to provide a date of birth. We wanted to look at getting ours verified, and it said we should enter one—even if we are a business. At no point did it say I should enter mine. So what did we put in? The most honest answer possible, the first day of trading in 1997. The AI came down like a ton of bricks, saying we were underage. I should note that Twitter’s own account would fall foul of this requirement! And what if I had hired a 20-something social media manager who put in their date of birth? The same thing would have happened. I thought: surely this will be a pretty routine matter to clear up? Twitter requested ‘government-issued ID’ that showed my face, my name, and date of birth. So far a driver’s licence and two passports (I have dual nationality) have not worked. They then moved the goalposts saying I could not be verified as the account owner. This is despite the account having the same IP as me, and all responses coming from the same email address which I signed up with. Oh, on that note, a USPTO trade mark registration and Wikipedia entries are insufficient to prove my ownership. I mentioned it to a Twitter executive I knew, and he referred it to their internal support team. I have heard sweet F. A. from them. This has been going on since October 2021. Twitter even had the cheek to send me an email, one month after my last submission of proof, to say that they would like to close the case since it had been resolved. Basically, they do nothing, they just send meaningless, programmed responses. Even their trade mark department sent an autoresponse with a link … to a 404. I guess they are so inefficient or incompetent that making US$4,000 million in revenue a year isn’t enough to do the basics. Or maybe they like censorship. It’s a matter of record that they’ve closed down antiwar and Occupy accounts. I used to think Facebook, Inc. was bad, but when our work Instagram was deactivated there, they actually had humans respond to us and everything was back in a week.  As someone who personally joined Twitter when it was still Twttr in 2007, I’m disappointed that their systems are so terrible, and that every move they have made to date has been farcical. A written letter is now before their New Zealand office’s lawyers but if the above is typical of Twitter, then I will expect another farcical response.",NZ

Within minutes, my account was permanently blocked and I was banned from Twitter for, and I quote 'Violating our rules against abuse and harassment. You may not engage in the targeted harassment of someone, or incite other people to do so. This includes wishing or hoping that someone experiences physical harm. What the absolute chuff is this? Twitter is a site that allows and more often than not, encourages, people to attack other people for thier sex, gender, race, social standing, they allow insults and name calling, aggressive Hashtag movements, I see almost on a daily basis, people verbally attacking each other and arguing about gender and race politics, slandering each other with ists, isms, and all manor of other labels and yet what get's someone banned and blocked is a silly joke and a bit of banter over a football match.  I'm at a complete loss for words. This toxic site really needs to be closed down because they're a health risk to society. They allow and encourage arguments and hate slander but attack and ban people without any warning for having a bit of a laugh. I had another account blocked and banned last year for making a comment on a story about a man who kidnapped, raped and murdered a child, I simply said 'this is why the death penalty should be brought back for people like this' and my account was blocked for 'spreading hate speech' Yet there was 100's of other comments on the same thread saying far worse and far more offensive things about said killer. Twitter should be banned and shut down until they get thier act together, they cherry pick what's deemed offensive and what's not and 90% of the time, they allow really hurtful offensive material and ban and block silly jokes or throw away comments. It's pathetic. They're playing with people's mental health, violating freedom of speech and are causing a lot of issues. It's ridiculous. I have appealed my case 3 times to them and not once have I had a reply from a human being, all I have had to all 3 of my appeals, all asking for information and detailing certain points I would like addressed regarding my suspension, is the EXACT same copied and posted 5 lines of text telling me my account has been suspended for 'violating Twitters rules' and will not be re-opened. These lot are criminals, plain and simple, they have zero user care, zero customer service to deal with issues and problems and they literally block and ban whoever they want and for any reason using bots and algorithms. There's not a human face to be had and appealing your case is 95% of the time, a pointless exorcise. Despicable site that should not legally be allowed to trade and exist in its current form.",GB

Twitter is less appealing and sadly a lot of other social media sites are starting to be less appealing like Twitter.

I've just been kicked off of the site because I got into an argument with a racist black guy who was all over the site calling various white people all manor of awful racist names. He called me a bunch of horrible disgusting things pertaining to my skin colour and ethnicity and when I responded in kind, I was immediately banned and blocked. I had to write an essay and appeal the decision and it's now been over 2 weeks and I've not even had a reply from them over it. All the while, this black guy who racially abused me is still on site and still abusing other white people. Using terms like ""White monkey"" ""Thin lips"" ""Mayonnaise face"" and other such racial slurs. Yet making comments on his ""Black"" features in response immediately gets you banned, reported and removed as a racist. This is not how you deal with online abuse and racism. There has to be a zero tolerance approach to it all or none at all. You can't just pick one group of people and say it's against your terms and conditions for them to abuse others and then allow other groups of people to abuse them. This is not how equality and stopping online abuse works. Maybe someone should explain this to Twitter.  Racial abuse and online slander is completely allowed on there if you are a POC. All this does is drive a bigger wedge through already frayed racial tensions. I know lots of white people who have been banned for merely standing up for themselves after being racially abused on there, yet Twitter has this view that racial abuse is only racial abuse when it's aimed at POC. There are loads of black people on the site who constantly post racial slurs and attacks and when confronted, they explode into a fit of racial slander, they've been reported and nothing ever gets done about it. Twitter, a site where racism and hatred is not just allowed but encouraged against white people. This is NOT equality. Oh and as a footnote, this is now the 3rd time I have been kicked off of Twitter, the other 2 times were for posting comments about how vile a convicted baby killer was and another about how I thought a serial rapist and murderer deserved the death penalty, Twitters reasoning?

Jack Dorsey needs to be fired as their CEO as soon as possible ! He is a social media dictator who engenders unmitgated limitations to people's freedom of speech . Twitter has become analogous to the Orwellian novel of 1984 since they behave just like Ingsoc, The Thought Police and Jack Dorsey is a scruffy,ignorant, and ,glorified hippie Big Brother wannabe/reject . I definitely wouldn't recommend Twitter to my worse enemy because it has become a virtual dystopian society . Users are certainly sooner or later going to abandon Twitter en masse in search of other social media venues that actually foster freedom of thought as a volitional right .

In 2015 I had a guy harass me on there for blocking him. He then proceeded to make new accounts (each time admitting it was him) and he even DM'D me on twitter saying he'd keep making accounts just to harass me on there. I reported him and provided the evidence and they said he wasnt violating their rules!  Different situation that's unrelated. I retweeted a video that I related to. Just a stand up comedy that featured Ricky Gervais. Put a caption that didn't mention names saying I had the same thing happen to me (as what Ricky was explaining in the video) next thing you know I get suspended because Twitter decided the retweet ""violated their rules"" supposedly something to do with hate speech, racism, harassing..Huh?? No names were mentioned, it wasnt threatening and it was no worse than I've seen on twitter many MANY times before. YET they suspended my account because of the retweet. They didn't see me being harassed in 2015 as a violation even when the guy admitted it in a message that I sent Twitter but a RETWEET that agreed to a point made by a comedian THAT was a suspend worthy violation? Riiight...also I've seen PORN on Twitter and I've seen people spread hate about MANY people and not get suspended. Mine was agreeing to a hilarious and very true stand up comedy about those scumbags who take random posts personal when the person posting doesn't even know them so it could be about anyone. I was agreeing to that cause it happened to me. Twitter suspended me and took down the tweet and threatened to take some my account.  Twitter support are obviously morons if they don't actually know what threatening, hate speech, racism and harassment is and SELECTIVELY suspend you for literally no reason. They're absolutely disgraceful and should be ashamed of themselves. As for twitter itself I enjoy it a lot. I do wish there was an edit option on our tweets though and I wish we could write more (very little space to write) some argue they prefer it like that.  P.S If they do take down my account i'll just rejoin and continue retweeting as apparently making multiple accounts isn't a violation according to you circa 2015 so...  👍",GB

Also sometimes I find it hard to find content I am looking for as there is so much it's hard to filter for what you're really looking for. Another thing to bear in mind is that every post you like, comment or retweet will show up on your profile page, this can be a negative aspect of the site to some.

It is uncalled for, that they only will allow content they only agree on. If it is not what they believe to be true, they will lock up your account. The same goes for facebook. It is a dictatorship of a company, that shows no bias of what is true or lies. They allow brain washing of there users to stay on, while freezing of accounts who speak the truth. Go ahead Twitter keep it up, and eventually thoes who see the lies will leave you as well. My paranormal team will not be back.

I've had 10 years of abuse hurled at me, profile cloned, mocked, spammed and not once has Twitter done anything against those who break the rules. Yet the moment you fight back against the cancerous abusers along comes Twitter and ""you're suspended"" and get handed a bot review while the criminality continues mocking and slandering you Twitter use to be good, But as NO warnings they suspend you.

It was a long distance relationship, which turned into a bad twitter romance, as I realized what a domineering, bullying, anti-social, narcissistic pig she was, which led to me airing a lot of dirty laundry on there, which is something I don't normally do, which caused a lot of stress for my mental health, and that's just the start of my gripe with this website.  Now, I can't speak about how twitter was 5-8 years ago, but from my perspective in 2018/2019 was that it was/is like a news media outlet website out to spread dread, and negativity, with fascist control over freedom of speech.  I'm an opinionated guy, always have been, and I got blocked without an explanation. I asked why they blocked me, they unblocked me a day later, and refused to tell me where the source of the complaint came from. I don't recall saying anything that offensive.  Social media has become a deadly poison, that I think it will continue to infect people that religiously use it as the years roll by, and it would affect their well being mentally. Social media makes us feel disconnected from the real world, so we lock all ourselves in this type of fantasy world, as form of escapism, which twitter doesn't really do, as it constantly promotes Brexit and Donald Trump, and other easy targets to bash until you get banned by the twitter police.  As for the people who use twitter are a lot of them are fake, shallow people, who are only looking for followers more so than actual communication with each other. I recall this one guy, I think his name was Jon Moses, a singer, I haven't a clue what he actually sings, or what his song style is, but he followed and unfollowed six times in a span of my first two months on twitter, so I end I had to block him, because I think in my opinion he was doing a form of trolling, which I didn't like, one thing I can't stand is attention seeking, drama queens. I had this quite a lot on twitter, people who follow you, expecting a follow back.  The final straw for me is when I got blocked by this girl who was talking about mental health, for no reason whatsoever. I followed because I was interested in her mental health posts, she for some reason took a dislike to me, so I got furious so I deleted my twitter account, because I got tired of wasting negative energy on there. So, a summary if you're a self-obsessed selfie queen who likes to take pics in the bathroom with your phone in the air, or you like to take pics of your pasta on a plate with your dirty mouth eating the stuff, then twitter is the place for you. If you like to post things like criticism, positive quotes, artwork or music, then that place is not for you.

I don’t have a political account or anything along those lines. My twitter account is for my boutique so I mainly share fashion related tweets, or “relevant” tweets, (example: “I never realized how much I took advantage of naps as a kid until I became an adult”) and they will suspend your account and their support system is a whole joke. Every time they suspend or lock your account it’s always for another absurd reason. Never have I ever had such problems with a social platform nor do I understand how they haven’t been shut down yet. I imagine it won’t be long.",US

Waited at the reception desk. The person who was doing the puncture asked me to go with him to the workshop area. Shows me the tyre and states, is that TURNBULLS work when he saw the plug fitted. I said no, i fitted the plug 6 months prior. He runs his fingers through   loose rubber shavings and states the car has been running on its rim and the tyre is dangerous so cant fit a plug. I know the loose shavings came from me when i was repairing the tyre with a plug. The hole has to be roughened up prior to inserting the plug.. I had informed another member of staff to tell the guy working on the tyre (cant call him a fitter) to put 33 pounds pressure in the tyre. I had also said to Andrew that i cant run  a tyre flat, sensors warn me when pressure drops.When i started to reverse  the rear left tyre warning light was on. The car can also tell me tyre pressures. front left which he had checked for leak also had 38 lbs a square inch, rear left had 26 lbs a square inch, not 33lbs as requested. The work and diagnostics was so sub standard that when i got home i blew a tyre up myself and deflated  the other as  the pressure was over excessive and checked all wheel nuts. Overexcessive pressure can cause an accident when cornering as theres  less rubber on the road surface.Incidently i thought i would like to mention that i have worked as a mechanic most of my life and also done mots and furhermore my car only two day prior had just had its mot  which passed. Can only assume there trying to sell extra tyres before xmas. My tyre which was only half worn could have been sold of as a part  worn tyre which is a win win, well for them anyway, not me.. Felt  it was a fairer business when Andrews father had it in the old place. DEFINATELY a bad experience for me. I will repair the tyre myself, another plug should do it. With tyre pressure being to high on the front left made the car dangerous when i left the garage. If the rear tyre was much less than it was (26 lbs) it could have come away from the rim when cornering. How hard is it to blow a tyre up to the correct pressure? UPDATE----Have checked front left tyre and at the previous plug repair,useing a little water located a small leakat plug (bubbles) fitted another plug alongside and rechecked, leak stopped! On rear found a screw nail in tyre, removed screw with pliersand inserted plug, tested with water, no problem, all leaks repaired and pressure maintained. Would advice drivers to purchase a plug repair kit from e bay and a smal electric pump from Home Bargains for a fiver and your independant. Majority of repairs can be done with the wheel on the car.

Meanwhile it's just limitations and verifications everywhere. #1: Why do I need a phone verification to use Twitter? This is an online service. So, could someone explain to me, why sensitive private data not needed for the service is mandatory? #2: Next, with a brand new account, I want to follow a few people. Hitting the first follow, the button changes, a few seconds later the button changes back. Error message: ""Sorry, something went wrong"". Second day. Same problem still. So, brand new account. Following not possible. #3: LIMITing characters to 140, BUT ... #4: Replying to a first tweet is possible. Replying to a second tweet and offering a link for additional information, since Twitter is a HEADLINE ENGINE, NOT A SOCIAL MEDIUM(!) ... Error message. NOT POSSIBLE!!! #5: Entering a website. Website unacceptable. Here is the clue: just because ""fraud"" is in the domain name, the website links is ""considered malware""! #6: Tweeting one or two links => account suspended. You could be a spammer. Congratulations Twitter! You know how to keep people away from your webiste. This is ridiculous! Do they want people to use the website or do they just want people to provide their private phone number and then leave and never come back again. Because that is what they make me do.
