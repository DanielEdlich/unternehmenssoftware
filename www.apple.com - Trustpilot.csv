Another scum bag way that apple charges ¬£10 for a 50p piece of excrement . If you ever decide to go the apple route I advise strongly against, far more hassle than it's worth in my opinion but sheep will be sheep I guess. 1 out of 10 is 1 to much for this company. Ultra disappointed",GB
3,www.apple.com,2023-01-11T13:46:30.000Z,1,Locking company account for 13 days,"The reset procedure was launched from the pc using the recovery credentials specified during account creation. The locked passord was not changed; it simply became unusable. The password linked to the apple id is the one used to access the pc. On the pc the password works, online it does not. The pc cannot be reset without online account. Online the password does not work. You basically pay for not having access to your hardware and not even having support.",CH

7,www.apple.com,2023-01-10T01:00:49.000Z,1,Pathetic for a large company,"Constantly changing their products so consumers need to buy overpriced additional accessories and their 2 hour delivery service is a joke. They'll just cancel the order on you without any notice. Then any gift cards you used will be refunded a full 24 hours later. And they pretty much just say ""oh well, it is what it is.""  For how big this company this is, this is just sad and pathetic. But I guess when you're already rich and successful, you can have a ""f*** you, that's why"" attitude.",US

Obviously with a refurbished one, as after 1 year the logic board is dead! Nothing to do about it. Not a single scratch on the device, it looks brand new. Yet it's dead.

""Returns box on it's way to you""..... Except it wasn't. Three weeks later a 40 minute call with an agent. ""All done, just pay the invoice"".... except the system would not accept payment so another 20 minute phone call paying by voice. A week later, box arrives, no returns label. A 20 minute call with an agent. Now it's a new repair. Now I need to pay. .... Except, you guessed it .... the payment process does not work. shambles!  Total utter shambles. rubbish.",GB

The single most convoluted, confusing and obscure online purchase process of my (and her) entire life. What a pile of crap. Payment methods added - which then seem to disappear overnight - probably explaining why things no longer work the next day. I have a Mac/iPhone/iPad - and it does work okay. But if you don't have these things... Apple make it as stupid as it could possibly be.",GB
